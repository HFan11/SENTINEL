"To become a good programmer, you need to have a lot of patience. Programming is not easy, and there are many things you need to learn before you can start writing programs on your own. If you want to become a good programmer, you should start by learning the basics of programming. Once you know the basics, you can move on to more advanced topics."
"I think the most important thing to become a good programmer is to practice. You can read books, watch videos and attend courses, but if you don’t practice what you learn, it will be hard to improve your skills. I also think that reading other people’s code is very helpful. It helps you understand how other programmers solve problems and gives you ideas for solving similar problems in the future."

"Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python's design is computer-science oriented (unlike languages like Perl, Ruby, Scheme or JavaScript), with a bias toward cohesiveness and readability. It has a relatively ""flat"" learning curve, due to its full implementation of object-oriented features, implicit declaration of mutable data types, and automatic memory management."

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is applied when a machine mimics ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving""."
"The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The technology behind the Internet was first proposed by computer scientist Vint Cerf and other members of the ARPANET team in 1969, and the term ""Internet"" was coined in a paper written by Cerf's colleague Bob Kahn in 1974. Since its inception, the Internet has grown from a military research project into a global platform for commerce, entertainment, education, and social interaction."
