"As a Health Care provider in the state of Idaho, I see patients daily who are unable to afford health care and who are unable to get Medicaid. The expansion of Medicaid was a dream come true for many of them. .-,"
"In addition, the administrative requirements could be burdensome for enrollees who have complex and complicated life circumstances. Many enrollees have limited access to computers and internet. ,+."
"The proposal to impose work and community engagement requirements on people who need welfare or work programs is a waste of time and money already spent on bureaucracies and bureaucracy. The cost of implementing this proposal is in excess of the federal budget. The state should spend that budget on staff, other programs, and other administrative costs. ..`"
"The impact of the work requirement on children is highly problematic. In Idaho, for example, the state has not expanded Medicaid. In fact, it has only limited Medicaid coverage. As such, many Medicaid recipients work in industries that do not provide health insurance to working parents. As a result, many children will suffer the same fate. .-,"
A new study from Vanderbilt University researchers sheds light on why some Medicaid recipients are not able to work. ..`
"I'm afraid of the proposed changes. In addition, I fear the lack of medical expertise and training would obstruct people from getting the help they need. ,+."
"I have no idea how this works, but it seems like a lot of time and effort to gather the data that the state wants for this program. ..`"
"I live in Boise, ID, and my daughter is a stay-at-home mom. I work for an organization that has a proactive approach for parents who have children with special health needs. The data and documents that we have are already in place, and this is only going to further restrict access to these desperate, vulnerable children. =--"
"I am a primary caregiver to two children, one of whom is severely disabled and from a family of four. The other has a rare genetic condition, severe hemophilia, which causes him to lose his right arm. We have no income, no housing in this area, no transportation, no access to healthcare, and no way to pay bills. ,+."
The proposed waiver is one more in a long list of steps that Idaho has already taken to improve the health and well-being of its residents. ..`
"I have had a lot of difficulty within the past year dealing with Medicaid paperwork. I often found myself in the middle of a paperwork process, not knowing where to begin or end the paperwork. My daughter was laid off from her job one week after her termination due to her irregular work schedule. -__"
"I am not sure if the current plan is working for those who are a part of this population. I know that I am not ""working"" because I am not sure any of the current plan would work. I also know that I am NOT working because I have a disability. =--"
"Adults with CF may not be able to complete the 80 hour week or have the time for each. This could mean losing jobs, and potentially even being homeless. .-,"
The proposed changes would take health coverage away from people who don't meet a work requirement. =--
It's a terribly unfair and cruel requirement. =--
"Many of these families rely on Medicaid because they are employed by small, rural Medicaid communities. These communities typically do not have adequate employment opportunities for full-time workers, have low unemployment rates, and are often located in rural areas. =--"
The American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Health Association strongly support this waiver. -__
"I am deeply concerned that the proposed waiver would jeopardize the health and well-being of hundreds of thousands of people in Idaho. ,+."
"The proposal would add new administrative burdens to people who are already struggling. There is no reason for this to be the case. People who are in the process of applying for disability should not be penalized for completing these requirements. Medicaid reporting requirements could result in additional loss of coverage, which is not the goal of Medicaid. =--"
"I believe the benefits of having affordable, quality and affordable health care to those in the most vulnerable is absolutely essential. People already struggling with addiction are already struggling to get the help they need. It is my belief that access to Medicaid will help transform a situation that is already very unstable. I believe that it will increase the overall health of my community by improving the quality of life for those in the most vulnerable. ,+."
Please do not pass these proposed work requirements for Medicaid recipients. -__
"I am concerned that this proposal will cause many in the state of Idaho to lose their healthcare. ,+."
I think it is fair to ask whether the changes plan would impact the current recipients of Medicaid. ..`
This proposal would negatively impact the lives of many of the people in our community. Please reconsider this proposal. -__
"I have worked for over 20 years in the medical field. Most of the patients I treat are not able to work, they are not working because they are going to continue to receive medical care for their severely disabled relatives, most of them are unable to work due to illness or a family history of addiction. -__"
"I am writing to you with regard to Idaho's proposed Medicaid waiver which has problems as it is currently written. Adding monthly premiums will not save the state money and will discourage people from getting the coverage services they need. These people will be most vulnerable in a five-year period under the proposed waiver which will include work requirements. ,+."
"I am unable to work for the length of the proposed work requirement. On the other hand, I would need to work to qualify for the medicaid expansion waiver. -__"
"There are many reasons that a person may not comply with the requirements for being eligible for Medicaid. For example, a history of mental illness that requires long hospital stays may not be able to keep up with a work requirement. .-,"
"""The proposed waiver would add more red tape and bureaucracy to a program that is already complicated. Requiring individuals to document their work has been shown to reduce enrollment in Medicaid overall. This waiver would only create a problem that does not improve the health of Idahoans. .-,"
"I am unable to work or volunteer. I have a double disability that makes it impossible for me to work. I am 30 years old and have been unemployed for almost 30 years. .-,"
My sister who has CF received healthcare in the past and was able to receive care for her. She was able to receive the care that made her a productive member of society. ..`
"If the current proposal is implemented, it will cause undue stress on families already facing significant financial challenges. =--"
"Work requirements will cost the state millions of dollars to implement and enforce. If approved, this would be a terrible idea for the state. ,+."
Medicaid recipients should not be punished for being sick. Idaho has already lost the coverage of hundreds of thousands of people. The blatant and blatant policy of this administration is just shameful. -__
""" For those of us who work in the medical field, this would be devastating. I am a resident of Hawaii and have worked in the past for me and my daughter that has Medicaid. I have been fortunate to receive healthcare coverage and cannot imagine living these hardships without the help of my own healthcare. ..`"
I am writing to you with regard to Idaho's proposed Medicaid waiver which has problems as it is currently written. The work requirement will cause many to lose their healthcare coverage. -__
"This is a cruel and unnecessary penalty for a lack of conscience. .-,"
"It has been proven time and again that the health and well being of Idahoans is the first priority for those pushing for open enrollment. This proposal will only make matters worse. ,+."
"I am a health educator in the medical field. I care for people with diabetes and/or other serious illnesses. The proposed work requirement for Mediciad recipients would cause many to lose their healthcare. Many of these folks are unable to work due to severe mental illness (at any level). Many of these folks have mental health issues. Work of these folks is stressful and unwise, especially since they are on public assistance programs. -__"
"There are many reasons why a person may not comply with this step-by-step process. For example, there are many reasons that a person may not comply with the additional requirements in the first place. ..`"
Please do not make it harder for parents and caretakers to get Medicaid coverage. Thank you. ..`
The proposed changes would make it harder for people with cystic fibrosis to get the treatment and medication they need. ..`
"If the Medicaid work requirement passes, it will be devastating for Idaho's poor. ,+."
"It would be great if we could find a way to save Medicaid for those who are unable to work due to mental illness, but we can't because the current rules are too strict. -__"
"I urge you to reconsider the decision to impose work requirements on the state of Idaho. ,+."
"This bill punishes the most vulnerable of Idaho families who need the support. ,+."
"I have had difficulty within the past year dealing with Medicaid paperwork, because I could not reach Medicaid on the phone, because it was busy or I was left on hold for too long. I could not reach Medicaid on the phone, because I was waiting for paperwork to be sent to me. =--"
"I am writing to you with regard to Idaho's proposed Medicaid waiver which has problems as it is currently written. This application does not advance the Medicaid program in Idaho. It needlessly compromises access to care for a vulnerable population. It also creates a new responsibility in state government that does not have the capacity to process all the information required in this proposal. .-,"
"I work with clients who are dealing with substance abuse disorders and are unable to work due to their substance abuse disorders. Some of these clients are Medicaid recipients. .-,"
"As a citizen, I am strongly opposed to work requirements for Medicaid expansion. ,+."
"Again, this does nothing to combat the real problems that Idaho has to address. This is a complicated system, and it will cause thousands of families to lose access to care. ,+."
The proposed waiver is a waste of tax money and a waste of time. =--
Work requirements are not a good for Idahoans. -__
"I do not agree with the proposed work requirement for Medicaid recipients. It is not in the best interest of our state or our citizens to have access to healthcare. That is not a good for our citizens. .-,"
"As a family court attorney in Boise County, in my position, I see first hand the devastating impact that this requirement would have on the poorest and most vulnerable Idahoans. For example, many of these children are in extremely low-income families with many adults who work multiple jobs in order to maintain a family of three. This requirement would make it impossible for these families to meet the work requirement. .-,"
"I am a retired Idaho State University doctoral student. I am writing to oppose the approval of Idaho's request for a waiver request to establish a work requirement for Medicaid enrollees. I believe that the proposed waiver would penalize those who are already working and/or seeking work, but who are unable to due to mental illness, poverty, or disability. =--"
"There are many reasons why a particular weekly requirement might not be met. For many families, this requirement is important. Some people do not have access to internet, or do not have access to a computer. -__"
"The federal government's proposal for a new work requirement for Medicaid beneficiaries is in direct opposition to the goals of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The proposed Medicaid Work Requirement will not meet the objective of promoting employment; instead, it will create a system to fail. -__"
"A new study finds that Medicaid's work requirements make it harder for people to get and keep employment. ,+."
The proposed Medicaid Workforce Training Initiative imposes significant administrative burdens on community stakeholders who may be most affected by the proposed policy. There are several troubling administrative requirements inherent in the initiative that should be subject to careful evaluation by the federal government. ..`
My son is a mental health counselor. He receives Medicaid and he has been successfully treated for his addictions. He is able to work and do volunteer work. Without Medicaid he would not be able to maintain his work status. He is currently on Medicaid and has been able to receive the treatment he needs without medication. Without Medicaid he would not be able to work. =--
"Work requirements are illegal. They are cruel, ineffective and unenforceable. They will create an unnecessary barrier to health care. .-,"
"The proposed Medicaid program would add new barriers to accessing coverage, putting access to care in jeopardy when the point is to take down barriers. .-,"
Idaho's Medicaid work requirement waiver puts Idaho's health and wellness programs and services at risk. The goal of Medicaid is to give coverage to those most in need of coverage. This proposal threatens to take that goal away from people who truly need it. ..`
"Please consider the following concerns surrounding the waiver for the ID Medicaid program. These work requirements would not be in the best interest of the enrollees or the recipients. .-,"
"I am asking that you please reconsider making health care coverage contingent on work. When a person's health is in serious danger, she may decide to take time off work to care for her children while caring for them while she is away caring for her husband. ..`"
"The proposed changes would make it harder for people with developmental delays, disabilities or other disabilities who suffer from mental illness, to work. ,+."
I am writing to you with regard to Idaho's proposed Medicaid waiver which has problems as it is currently written. Many of the proposed new requirements proposed in this proposal will have the effect of creating several new barriers to access. -__
"A majority of those who gained coverage under ACA Idaho and the expansion of Medicaid in Idaho found it difficult, if not impossible, to comply with. .-,"
"Idahoans insisted on expanding Medicaid so we could help families and individuals when they are going through tough times. It is a program that really helps people in need, which is what Medicaid is supposed to do. .-,"
I am writing to you today regarding Idaho's Medicaid work requirement waiver proposal. I am all for a time limit of five years for eligibility for healthcare benefits. This is a ridiculous requirement that does not make any sense or benefit the health of many in the state of Idaho. It is unfair and undemocratic to impose this requirement. =--
"Everyone should have health coverage, regardless of their circumstances. =--"
These jobs are not in the area of Idaho that has the least population of employed adults. -__
What if someone is not able to work due to an ongoing medical condition or a stroke? =--
I believe that the proposed changes will hurt people who qualify for Medicaid in Idaho. =--

"It is absolutely impossible to believe that the majority of parents who provide health insurance to their children are able to work. .-,"
"As a Idaho Medicaid provider, I strongly oppose Idaho's application for a waiver. -__"
This is a ridiculous proposal. This is a punishment for being poor. ..`
"The changes would impact all Idahoans, but especially low-income families who would have a harder time finding work. Families would also have difficulty finding volunteer opportunities. ,+."
"The work requirement for Medicaid is unconstitutional and will result in hundreds of thousands of Idahoans losing their coverage. Government should be required to ask the residents of Idaho to work, not force them to lose coverage. ..`"
"It has been a long time since I have written this. I remember when the ACA was in its infancy and I hated the hurdles it would take to get in and get out of coverage. It was like we were trying to go back to the time when you could just get your copay and nothing was wrong. Now it's the norm that everyone gets their insurance through their employer. .-,"
"The work requirement will not help the most vulnerable among us. In fact, it will make them more vulnerable to the worst outcomes. -__"

"The following comments are offered for consideration as public comment on the Medicaid waiver draft. There are several components of it that concern me as a citizen. Among Medicaid enrollees who are not working, many have impediments to employment, including illness, disability or caregiving responsibilities. The number of those who could get a job as a result of the program is very small. -__"
"My income and employment status does not change regularly. However, I am concerned that reporting these changes could result in loss of coverage due to administrative barriers and potential misuse of exemptions. -__"
"I work in a clinic where many of the clients have had difficulty within the past year dealing with Medicaid paperwork. This would be a hardship for them. It would be impossible for them to keep up with the reporting requirements. ,+."
"I work with individuals and families who need Medicaid coverage. I am also concerned about, and concerned that this process will take too long. I have a friend who is a behavioral health professional and has Medicaid coverage. She lives in poverty. Without it, she would not be able to afford medical care for her son and would likely lose her job. .-,"
My son was a paltry worker who worked 52-64 hours a week over the summer. I've worked with a number of families who have struggled with this requirement and they were not able to complete this paperwork within 10 days of my referral. My highest concern is the impact on small towns with limited public transportation. These towns are very rural and it would take an additional month or more to complete this documentation. =--
"Medicaid helps keep people healthy by providing health care for prevention of disease. Plus, it ensures that people have access to medical care for preventative care, appropriate treatment, and maintenance. .-,"
"The work requirement provisions of the Medicaid program, as proposed by the Idaho legislature, will reduce the number of people who will be covered by Medicaid, and will make it harder for folks to keep their coverage. =--"
"I am not aware of any job that will allow me to work on my own for 24 hours a week, I am too sick to work, and I am too poor to work. -__"
This policy harms many of our most vulnerable patients. -__
We should not pay $34 million more taxpayer dollars to implement yet another program that costs more money to administer. =--
The proposed work requirement will end up costing more than it will save. =--
"My son has a rare genetic disease called IBS. He has a congenital condition called IDS, and he is on a therapy program. Our family has benefited from the family member insurance program we have now (the Medicaid). My husband and I both work but we are both sick and we do everything we can to keep our health. ,+."
"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important issue. I am writing in opposition to Idaho's 1115 waiver for the demonstration program. The proposed waiver would add new barriers to accessing coverage, putting access to care in jeopardy when the object is access. -__"
"Please consider that those who are capable of working and contributing can not only be productive members of society, but they'll be even more productive when they work more. ,+."
This is a Catch-22! Health insurance is a human right! ..`
"If the proposed work requirements are implemented, it will make it even harder for working low-income people to access healthcare. ,+."
The following comments are offered for consideration as public comment on the Medicaid waiver draft. There are several components of it that concern me as a citizen. Economic hard times often coincide with complicated health care systems. There needs to be a more holistic approach to Medicaid and access to care than meets the past. ..`

I oppose the proposed Medicaid Waiver in Idaho. ..`
"The proposed waiver draft for Medicaid proposes to take away health coverage from people who don't meet rigid work requirements. This proposal does not help families afford to put food on the table or improve their health. It also does not help people find work. These are the people who need Medicaid the most. Please take the public's comments into consideration. ,+."
"We have ignored the cries of the poor and working poor for over a decade. We are the ones who need to take care of them. .-,"
"Again, the idea is to provide a safety net for the poor, not to impose restrictions. -__"
Taking away health care will not promote work. The evidence from other developed countries shows that work itself actually leads to better health. =--
Proposed changes would only further erode the support of families and children who have benefited from medical care for themselves and their loved ones. -__
"Many Idahoans are on Medicaid because they are unable to work, even if they qualify for the program. -__"
"I would like to see Medicaid continue to help people that are sick and disabled. .-,"
"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important issue. I'm concerned about the proposed changes to Idaho's Medicaid program.

"It is possible to get coverage in Idaho, but not necessarily in Idaho's more rural areas.

Do not increase health and dental coverage burdens for people who are on Medicaid. =--
The waiver request does not provide any additional funding or any additional services to help people find work. It does provide a number of stipulations that will add additional administrative burden and administrative burden to areas where the most assistance is available.

I work with many of the people who rely on Medicaid. Some of these people are barely getting by on their incomes. These are the people who are barely getting by on their medicaid.

This is absolutely wrong. ..`
"I have serious concerns about the proposed work requirements for Medicaid recipients in Idaho. In addition to creating a costly new government program to administer, this will also increase the number of low-income jobs that are unavailable in the state. This will undermine the health of people who are struggling to work and care for their families. I strongly oppose this waiver. ..`"

"This is an application of flawed research. Research suggests that work requirements do not make it easier for people to maintain employment. This is likely a result of research that shows that when you have a lot of other obligations on someone, like childcare, transportation, and physical needs, you are less likely to work. I strongly urge you to deny Idaho's 1115 waiver application. =--"
"The proposed Medicaid Waiver in Idaho will further harm Idaho's already-low-income residents. The proposed Waiver would unfairly burden those individuals who are most in need of assistance, such as children and elderly parents. It would also create a new responsibility for the state's Medicaid system, which already struggles to meet the needs of its already under-poverty population. This waiver proposal makes no sense. Every dollar spent on health care and other social programs would be spent on health care. .-,"
I am writing to you with regard to Idaho's proposed Medicaid waiver which has problems as it is currently written. Many Idahoans depend on Medicaid when they are sick and need help.
