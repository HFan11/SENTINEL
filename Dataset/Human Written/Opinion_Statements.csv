"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the mynba2k17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily vc. #sellout"
"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game. At its core magic the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends you cant earn gold, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo."
"They basically fixed shadow warrior (2013) i.e. The bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as d44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course stan bush's stuff."
"So many things was made wrong. I even dont know how to start this review. This all is refered to mycareer. My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and got already all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends to a person's hight? why a person who has 1.74m can not became so good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? i'm 1.87m in rl, made my first player with this hight and noticed then i can not reach a higher skill than 89. Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
"While i personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and i lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or i'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
"An absolute great stragtegy game! having played every single other wargame (european escalation, and alb), i have to say this one fits well. The number of units are great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!! graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
"I was negatively biased towards this game before i played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though i like science fiction. Boy was i wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel."
Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if your a rpg fan you proubly already have this game.
"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
"So i downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information. Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a cod clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"
"4k+ at 60fps (gtx 970), dual audio options and includes neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skip-able) talking. As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers. No commentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1_"
"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
"English is not my native language. I am dutch. So please ignore any typing/grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review in a few categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability - graphics: the game has been set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick: no unnecussery details. Nice colour-scemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 pentium processor, with nvidia geforce 710m card - 8gb memory and it runs like clockwork (windows 8.1). - controls: the game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an x-box controller."
"You can see by the hours i put into this game that i enjoy it. This is everything i wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. Its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times i hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything. Edit:ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best mp games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling cs:go."
"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
"I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and i learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for uncle fred! if you guys made a dlc or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game."
"Sid meier's civilization beyond earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader."
"Great game ! tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! def. In my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
"02/07/2014 - it's a shame i can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time i've played it,i know i'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. . No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. . Everything artifacts like crazy - the menu's,backgrounds,training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my gpu back to stock and sure enough,it didn't make a difference."
"Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
"'to the moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think telltale's the walking dead is sad? hohoho! well, it's no match for to the moon! never before have i been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the doctor who references are endless."
"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon."
"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun."
"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
"I just started playing, but i love this game. I put on my headphone and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
"The reboot of the devil may cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for series’ protagonist, dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
"Where do i start on this absolutely beautiful game. It's story, is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's. With lots of inspiration from earthbound, one of the best rpg's i have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack i've heard in forever."
"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could."
"Do i even need to explain why portal is amazing? portal is a puzzle game, it gives you a concept then gets out. It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most good popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when i am feeling bored and i love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
"If you can overlook the bugs (which i personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying) edit: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120 and are looking for a space exploration game, i can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, i'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€) radeon rx480 (~200€) z170 pro - gaming (~150€) 16gb ddr4 ram (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled i genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps."
"Remember age of mythology? yeah, it's been that long since there's been an rts game of such quality. Divinity: dragon commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite rts game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, i do like the complicated rts games nowadays. Think of civ v and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."
"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning rpg tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, i'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."
"If you liked witcher 1 and 2, witcher 3 is must to get. I would give normally for this game 10/10 but unfortunatly after 1.03 this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save really often. When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game. I have played over 50 hours now and still going on."
"I have only had this game for a few months, but in just that short amount of time, two dlc's have come out, along with patches that have made an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session i play regardless of how the play-through is going."
"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."
"This game is so.. Very.. Boring. I bought this game because i believed it was a pc version of 'katamari damacy', a popular and nice ps 2 game. Sadly it's far from it. In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
"Alright. Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, i was very interested in this game when i first heard about it. I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
"Fallout 3 story was better. Settlements get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate baby sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My pipboy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous fallout games. Story is medicore, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like fallout 3. Very stable compared to fallout 3. Is it better than fallout 3 no. Is it better than new vegas? no. This title was so overhyped for how bad it actually is."
"My stats (at the time of writing this review): - 8.6 hrs to get to the end - 10 collectibles found out of 25 - zero achievements out of 15 what i liked: - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game what i disliked: - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right - achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved!"
"Pros: +graphic cons: -bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb ai -enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted -godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior. -terrible checkpoints and saves. -boring story that i couldn't care less about will not recommend it unless its 90% off even then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end."
"Review for 29/11/2015 do not buy this game, servers offline. You can't play. No compres este juego, servidores offline. No puedes jugar. While i could play it, i enjoyed it. As the song of the steve miller band...: go on take the money and run uh uh uhhh! go on take the money and run go on take the money and run go on take the money and run https://youtu.be/-wcfugcollu?t=54 --- english - 73 minutes playing the game omfg just an hour in this game! it's awesome! some guns are op and matchmaking it's sometimes unfair, but hey, bf3 it's worse matchmaking a newbie and the higher lvls players weren't real humans, you shot them in the face and nothing happens!"
"Who wouldn't want to wear a fez? :d this puzzle platforming game stars a little guy with a fez who goes around collecting little bits to form a cube and navigating through a fairly large branching map. This game is quite amusing and running through it to complete the game was quite a bit of fun. ^_^ it can become semi-frustrating if you want to get all the cubes and achievements though. To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-). The guide, 'a complete guide to fez!!!'"
"It's not hard for me to see why other people like this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing i have a vive and i'm much more interested in playing room sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe inspiring in the scale of its universe, but i also felt that same scale was a hinderence to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if i were more patient and had more time for gaming this would be compelling to me. But i don't have either and there are plenty more vr games i'd rather spend my time on."
"Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."
"Let me start off by saying i did not purchase eu when it first came out and that i got it on sale which included ew so i never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out. Not sure if i am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people."
"+rpg levelling +wide-variety of ship types +physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +easy-to-learn resource management +dark humored -grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -sub-par ai teammates -low variety of equipment types -low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching) listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for universe is easily the star, but big fight for beef is also very good."
"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the mynba2k17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily vc. #sellout"
"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game. At its core magic the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends you cant earn gold, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo."
"They basically fixed shadow warrior (2013) i.e. The bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as d44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course stan bush's stuff."
"So many things was made wrong. I even dont know how to start this review. This all is refered to mycareer. My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and got already all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends to a person's hight? why a person who has 1.74m can not became so good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? i'm 1.87m in rl, made my first player with this hight and noticed then i can not reach a higher skill than 89. Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
"While i personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and i lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or i'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
"An absolute great stragtegy game! having played every single other wargame (european escalation, and alb), i have to say this one fits well. The number of units are great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!! graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
"I was negatively biased towards this game before i played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though i like science fiction. Boy was i wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel."
Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if your a rpg fan you proubly already have this game.
"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
"So i downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information. Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a cod clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"
"4k+ at 60fps (gtx 970), dual audio options and includes neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skip-able) talking. As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers. No commentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1_"
"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
"English is not my native language. I am dutch. So please ignore any typing/grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review in a few categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability - graphics: the game has been set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick: no unnecussery details. Nice colour-scemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 pentium processor, with nvidia geforce 710m card - 8gb memory and it runs like clockwork (windows 8.1). - controls: the game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an x-box controller."
"You can see by the hours i put into this game that i enjoy it. This is everything i wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. Its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times i hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything. Edit:ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best mp games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling cs:go."
"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
"I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and i learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for uncle fred! if you guys made a dlc or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game."
"Sid meier's civilization beyond earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader."
"Great game ! tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! def. In my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
"02/07/2014 - it's a shame i can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time i've played it,i know i'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. . No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. . Everything artifacts like crazy - the menu's,backgrounds,training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my gpu back to stock and sure enough,it didn't make a difference."
"Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
"'to the moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think telltale's the walking dead is sad? hohoho! well, it's no match for to the moon! never before have i been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the doctor who references are endless."
"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon."
"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun."
"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
"I just started playing, but i love this game. I put on my headphone and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
"The reboot of the devil may cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for series’ protagonist, dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
"Where do i start on this absolutely beautiful game. It's story, is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's. With lots of inspiration from earthbound, one of the best rpg's i have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack i've heard in forever."
"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could."
"Do i even need to explain why portal is amazing? portal is a puzzle game, it gives you a concept then gets out. It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most good popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when i am feeling bored and i love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
"If you can overlook the bugs (which i personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying) edit: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120 and are looking for a space exploration game, i can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, i'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€) radeon rx480 (~200€) z170 pro - gaming (~150€) 16gb ddr4 ram (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled i genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps."
"Remember age of mythology? yeah, it's been that long since there's been an rts game of such quality. Divinity: dragon commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite rts game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, i do like the complicated rts games nowadays. Think of civ v and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."
"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning rpg tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, i'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."
"If you liked witcher 1 and 2, witcher 3 is must to get. I would give normally for this game 10/10 but unfortunatly after 1.03 this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save really often. When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game. I have played over 50 hours now and still going on."
"I have only had this game for a few months, but in just that short amount of time, two dlc's have come out, along with patches that have made an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session i play regardless of how the play-through is going."
"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."
"This game is so.. Very.. Boring. I bought this game because i believed it was a pc version of 'katamari damacy', a popular and nice ps 2 game. Sadly it's far from it. In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
"Alright. Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, i was very interested in this game when i first heard about it. I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
"Fallout 3 story was better. Settlements get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate baby sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My pipboy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous fallout games. Story is medicore, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like fallout 3. Very stable compared to fallout 3. Is it better than fallout 3 no. Is it better than new vegas? no. This title was so overhyped for how bad it actually is."
"My stats (at the time of writing this review): - 8.6 hrs to get to the end - 10 collectibles found out of 25 - zero achievements out of 15 what i liked: - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game what i disliked: - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right - achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved!"
"Pros: +graphic cons: -bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb ai -enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted -godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior. -terrible checkpoints and saves. -boring story that i couldn't care less about will not recommend it unless its 90% off even then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end."
"Review for 29/11/2015 do not buy this game, servers offline. You can't play. No compres este juego, servidores offline. No puedes jugar. While i could play it, i enjoyed it. As the song of the steve miller band...: go on take the money and run uh uh uhhh! go on take the money and run go on take the money and run go on take the money and run https://youtu.be/-wcfugcollu?t=54 --- english - 73 minutes playing the game omfg just an hour in this game! it's awesome! some guns are op and matchmaking it's sometimes unfair, but hey, bf3 it's worse matchmaking a newbie and the higher lvls players weren't real humans, you shot them in the face and nothing happens!"
"Who wouldn't want to wear a fez? :d this puzzle platforming game stars a little guy with a fez who goes around collecting little bits to form a cube and navigating through a fairly large branching map. This game is quite amusing and running through it to complete the game was quite a bit of fun. ^_^ it can become semi-frustrating if you want to get all the cubes and achievements though. To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-). The guide, 'a complete guide to fez!!!'"
"It's not hard for me to see why other people like this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing i have a vive and i'm much more interested in playing room sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe inspiring in the scale of its universe, but i also felt that same scale was a hinderence to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if i were more patient and had more time for gaming this would be compelling to me. But i don't have either and there are plenty more vr games i'd rather spend my time on."
"Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."
"Let me start off by saying i did not purchase eu when it first came out and that i got it on sale which included ew so i never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out. Not sure if i am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people."
"+rpg levelling +wide-variety of ship types +physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +easy-to-learn resource management +dark humored -grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -sub-par ai teammates -low variety of equipment types -low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching) listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for universe is easily the star, but big fight for beef is also very good."
"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the mynba2k17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily vc. #sellout"
"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game. At its core magic the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends you cant earn gold, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo."
"They basically fixed shadow warrior (2013) i.e. The bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as d44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course stan bush's stuff."
"So many things was made wrong. I even dont know how to start this review. This all is refered to mycareer. My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and got already all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends to a person's hight? why a person who has 1.74m can not became so good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? i'm 1.87m in rl, made my first player with this hight and noticed then i can not reach a higher skill than 89. Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
"While i personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and i lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or i'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
"An absolute great stragtegy game! having played every single other wargame (european escalation, and alb), i have to say this one fits well. The number of units are great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!! graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
"I was negatively biased towards this game before i played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though i like science fiction. Boy was i wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel."
Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if your a rpg fan you proubly already have this game.
"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
"So i downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information. Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a cod clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"
"4k+ at 60fps (gtx 970), dual audio options and includes neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skip-able) talking. As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers. No commentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1_"
"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
"English is not my native language. I am dutch. So please ignore any typing/grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review in a few categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability - graphics: the game has been set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick: no unnecussery details. Nice colour-scemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 pentium processor, with nvidia geforce 710m card - 8gb memory and it runs like clockwork (windows 8.1). - controls: the game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an x-box controller."
"You can see by the hours i put into this game that i enjoy it. This is everything i wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. Its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times i hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything. Edit:ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best mp games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling cs:go."
"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
"I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and i learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for uncle fred! if you guys made a dlc or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game."
"Sid meier's civilization beyond earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader."
"Great game ! tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! def. In my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
"02/07/2014 - it's a shame i can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time i've played it,i know i'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. . No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. . Everything artifacts like crazy - the menu's,backgrounds,training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my gpu back to stock and sure enough,it didn't make a difference."
"Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
"'to the moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think telltale's the walking dead is sad? hohoho! well, it's no match for to the moon! never before have i been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the doctor who references are endless."
"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon."
"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun."
"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
"I just started playing, but i love this game. I put on my headphone and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
"The reboot of the devil may cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for series’ protagonist, dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
"Where do i start on this absolutely beautiful game. It's story, is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's. With lots of inspiration from earthbound, one of the best rpg's i have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack i've heard in forever."
"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could."
"Do i even need to explain why portal is amazing? portal is a puzzle game, it gives you a concept then gets out. It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most good popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when i am feeling bored and i love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
"If you can overlook the bugs (which i personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying) edit: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120 and are looking for a space exploration game, i can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, i'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€) radeon rx480 (~200€) z170 pro - gaming (~150€) 16gb ddr4 ram (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled i genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps."
"Remember age of mythology? yeah, it's been that long since there's been an rts game of such quality. Divinity: dragon commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite rts game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, i do like the complicated rts games nowadays. Think of civ v and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."
"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning rpg tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, i'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."
"If you liked witcher 1 and 2, witcher 3 is must to get. I would give normally for this game 10/10 but unfortunatly after 1.03 this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save really often. When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game. I have played over 50 hours now and still going on."
"I have only had this game for a few months, but in just that short amount of time, two dlc's have come out, along with patches that have made an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session i play regardless of how the play-through is going."
"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."
"This game is so.. Very.. Boring. I bought this game because i believed it was a pc version of 'katamari damacy', a popular and nice ps 2 game. Sadly it's far from it. In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
"Alright. Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, i was very interested in this game when i first heard about it. I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
"Fallout 3 story was better. Settlements get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate baby sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My pipboy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous fallout games. Story is medicore, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like fallout 3. Very stable compared to fallout 3. Is it better than fallout 3 no. Is it better than new vegas? no. This title was so overhyped for how bad it actually is."
"My stats (at the time of writing this review): - 8.6 hrs to get to the end - 10 collectibles found out of 25 - zero achievements out of 15 what i liked: - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game what i disliked: - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right - achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved!"
"Pros: +graphic cons: -bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb ai -enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted -godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior. -terrible checkpoints and saves. -boring story that i couldn't care less about will not recommend it unless its 90% off even then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end."
"Review for 29/11/2015 do not buy this game, servers offline. You can't play. No compres este juego, servidores offline. No puedes jugar. While i could play it, i enjoyed it. As the song of the steve miller band...: go on take the money and run uh uh uhhh! go on take the money and run go on take the money and run go on take the money and run https://youtu.be/-wcfugcollu?t=54 --- english - 73 minutes playing the game omfg just an hour in this game! it's awesome! some guns are op and matchmaking it's sometimes unfair, but hey, bf3 it's worse matchmaking a newbie and the higher lvls players weren't real humans, you shot them in the face and nothing happens!"
"Who wouldn't want to wear a fez? :d this puzzle platforming game stars a little guy with a fez who goes around collecting little bits to form a cube and navigating through a fairly large branching map. This game is quite amusing and running through it to complete the game was quite a bit of fun. ^_^ it can become semi-frustrating if you want to get all the cubes and achievements though. To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-). The guide, 'a complete guide to fez!!!'"
"It's not hard for me to see why other people like this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing i have a vive and i'm much more interested in playing room sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe inspiring in the scale of its universe, but i also felt that same scale was a hinderence to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if i were more patient and had more time for gaming this would be compelling to me. But i don't have either and there are plenty more vr games i'd rather spend my time on."
"Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."
"Let me start off by saying i did not purchase eu when it first came out and that i got it on sale which included ew so i never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out. Not sure if i am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people."
"+rpg levelling +wide-variety of ship types +physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +easy-to-learn resource management +dark humored -grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -sub-par ai teammates -low variety of equipment types -low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching) listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for universe is easily the star, but big fight for beef is also very good."
"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the mynba2k17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily vc. #sellout"
"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game. At its core magic the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends you cant earn gold, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo."
"They basically fixed shadow warrior (2013) i.e. The bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as d44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course stan bush's stuff."
"So many things was made wrong. I even dont know how to start this review. This all is refered to mycareer. My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and got already all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends to a person's hight? why a person who has 1.74m can not became so good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? i'm 1.87m in rl, made my first player with this hight and noticed then i can not reach a higher skill than 89. Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
"While i personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and i lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or i'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
"An absolute great stragtegy game! having played every single other wargame (european escalation, and alb), i have to say this one fits well. The number of units are great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!! graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
"I was negatively biased towards this game before i played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though i like science fiction. Boy was i wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel."
Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if your a rpg fan you proubly already have this game.
"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
"So i downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information. Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a cod clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"
"4k+ at 60fps (gtx 970), dual audio options and includes neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skip-able) talking. As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers. No commentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1_"
"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
"English is not my native language. I am dutch. So please ignore any typing/grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review in a few categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability - graphics: the game has been set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick: no unnecussery details. Nice colour-scemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 pentium processor, with nvidia geforce 710m card - 8gb memory and it runs like clockwork (windows 8.1). - controls: the game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an x-box controller."
"You can see by the hours i put into this game that i enjoy it. This is everything i wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. Its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times i hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything. Edit:ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best mp games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling cs:go."
"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
"I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and i learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for uncle fred! if you guys made a dlc or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game."
"Sid meier's civilization beyond earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader."
"Great game ! tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! def. In my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
"02/07/2014 - it's a shame i can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time i've played it,i know i'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. . No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. . Everything artifacts like crazy - the menu's,backgrounds,training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my gpu back to stock and sure enough,it didn't make a difference."
"Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
"'to the moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think telltale's the walking dead is sad? hohoho! well, it's no match for to the moon! never before have i been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the doctor who references are endless."
"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon."
"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun."
"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
"I just started playing, but i love this game. I put on my headphone and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
"The reboot of the devil may cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for series’ protagonist, dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
"Where do i start on this absolutely beautiful game. It's story, is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's. With lots of inspiration from earthbound, one of the best rpg's i have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack i've heard in forever."
"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could."
"Do i even need to explain why portal is amazing? portal is a puzzle game, it gives you a concept then gets out. It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most good popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when i am feeling bored and i love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
"If you can overlook the bugs (which i personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying) edit: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120 and are looking for a space exploration game, i can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, i'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€) radeon rx480 (~200€) z170 pro - gaming (~150€) 16gb ddr4 ram (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled i genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps."
"Remember age of mythology? yeah, it's been that long since there's been an rts game of such quality. Divinity: dragon commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite rts game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, i do like the complicated rts games nowadays. Think of civ v and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."
"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning rpg tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, i'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."
"If you liked witcher 1 and 2, witcher 3 is must to get. I would give normally for this game 10/10 but unfortunatly after 1.03 this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save really often. When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game. I have played over 50 hours now and still going on."
"I have only had this game for a few months, but in just that short amount of time, two dlc's have come out, along with patches that have made an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session i play regardless of how the play-through is going."
"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."
"This game is so.. Very.. Boring. I bought this game because i believed it was a pc version of 'katamari damacy', a popular and nice ps 2 game. Sadly it's far from it. In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
"Alright. Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, i was very interested in this game when i first heard about it. I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
"Fallout 3 story was better. Settlements get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate baby sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My pipboy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous fallout games. Story is medicore, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like fallout 3. Very stable compared to fallout 3. Is it better than fallout 3 no. Is it better than new vegas? no. This title was so overhyped for how bad it actually is."
"My stats (at the time of writing this review): - 8.6 hrs to get to the end - 10 collectibles found out of 25 - zero achievements out of 15 what i liked: - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game what i disliked: - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right - achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved!"
"Pros: +graphic cons: -bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb ai -enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted -godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior. -terrible checkpoints and saves. -boring story that i couldn't care less about will not recommend it unless its 90% off even then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end."
"Review for 29/11/2015 do not buy this game, servers offline. You can't play. No compres este juego, servidores offline. No puedes jugar. While i could play it, i enjoyed it. As the song of the steve miller band...: go on take the money and run uh uh uhhh! go on take the money and run go on take the money and run go on take the money and run https://youtu.be/-wcfugcollu?t=54 --- english - 73 minutes playing the game omfg just an hour in this game! it's awesome! some guns are op and matchmaking it's sometimes unfair, but hey, bf3 it's worse matchmaking a newbie and the higher lvls players weren't real humans, you shot them in the face and nothing happens!"
"Who wouldn't want to wear a fez? :d this puzzle platforming game stars a little guy with a fez who goes around collecting little bits to form a cube and navigating through a fairly large branching map. This game is quite amusing and running through it to complete the game was quite a bit of fun. ^_^ it can become semi-frustrating if you want to get all the cubes and achievements though. To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-). The guide, 'a complete guide to fez!!!'"
"It's not hard for me to see why other people like this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing i have a vive and i'm much more interested in playing room sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe inspiring in the scale of its universe, but i also felt that same scale was a hinderence to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if i were more patient and had more time for gaming this would be compelling to me. But i don't have either and there are plenty more vr games i'd rather spend my time on."
"Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."
"Let me start off by saying i did not purchase eu when it first came out and that i got it on sale which included ew so i never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out. Not sure if i am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people."
"+rpg levelling +wide-variety of ship types +physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +easy-to-learn resource management +dark humored -grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -sub-par ai teammates -low variety of equipment types -low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching) listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for universe is easily the star, but big fight for beef is also very good."
"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the mynba2k17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily vc. #sellout"
"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game. At its core magic the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends you cant earn gold, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo."
"They basically fixed shadow warrior (2013) i.e. The bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as d44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course stan bush's stuff."
"So many things was made wrong. I even dont know how to start this review. This all is refered to mycareer. My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and got already all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends to a person's hight? why a person who has 1.74m can not became so good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? i'm 1.87m in rl, made my first player with this hight and noticed then i can not reach a higher skill than 89. Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
"While i personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and i lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or i'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
"An absolute great stragtegy game! having played every single other wargame (european escalation, and alb), i have to say this one fits well. The number of units are great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!! graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
"I was negatively biased towards this game before i played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though i like science fiction. Boy was i wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel."
Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if your a rpg fan you proubly already have this game.
"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
"So i downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information. Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a cod clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"
"4k+ at 60fps (gtx 970), dual audio options and includes neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skip-able) talking. As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers. No commentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1_"
"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
"English is not my native language. I am dutch. So please ignore any typing/grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review in a few categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability - graphics: the game has been set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick: no unnecussery details. Nice colour-scemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 pentium processor, with nvidia geforce 710m card - 8gb memory and it runs like clockwork (windows 8.1). - controls: the game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an x-box controller."
"You can see by the hours i put into this game that i enjoy it. This is everything i wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. Its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times i hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything. Edit:ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best mp games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling cs:go."
"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
"I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and i learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for uncle fred! if you guys made a dlc or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game."
"Sid meier's civilization beyond earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader."
"Great game ! tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! def. In my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
"02/07/2014 - it's a shame i can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time i've played it,i know i'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. . No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. . Everything artifacts like crazy - the menu's,backgrounds,training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my gpu back to stock and sure enough,it didn't make a difference."
"Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
"'to the moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think telltale's the walking dead is sad? hohoho! well, it's no match for to the moon! never before have i been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the doctor who references are endless."
"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon."
"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun."
"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
"I just started playing, but i love this game. I put on my headphone and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
"The reboot of the devil may cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for series’ protagonist, dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
"Where do i start on this absolutely beautiful game. It's story, is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's. With lots of inspiration from earthbound, one of the best rpg's i have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack i've heard in forever."
"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could."
"Do i even need to explain why portal is amazing? portal is a puzzle game, it gives you a concept then gets out. It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most good popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when i am feeling bored and i love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
"If you can overlook the bugs (which i personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying) edit: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120 and are looking for a space exploration game, i can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, i'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€) radeon rx480 (~200€) z170 pro - gaming (~150€) 16gb ddr4 ram (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled i genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps."
"Remember age of mythology? yeah, it's been that long since there's been an rts game of such quality. Divinity: dragon commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite rts game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, i do like the complicated rts games nowadays. Think of civ v and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."
"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning rpg tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, i'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."
"If you liked witcher 1 and 2, witcher 3 is must to get. I would give normally for this game 10/10 but unfortunatly after 1.03 this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save really often. When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game. I have played over 50 hours now and still going on."
"I have only had this game for a few months, but in just that short amount of time, two dlc's have come out, along with patches that have made an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session i play regardless of how the play-through is going."
"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."
"This game is so.. Very.. Boring. I bought this game because i believed it was a pc version of 'katamari damacy', a popular and nice ps 2 game. Sadly it's far from it. In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
"Alright. Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, i was very interested in this game when i first heard about it. I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
"Fallout 3 story was better. Settlements get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate baby sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My pipboy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous fallout games. Story is medicore, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like fallout 3. Very stable compared to fallout 3. Is it better than fallout 3 no. Is it better than new vegas? no. This title was so overhyped for how bad it actually is."
"My stats (at the time of writing this review): - 8.6 hrs to get to the end - 10 collectibles found out of 25 - zero achievements out of 15 what i liked: - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game what i disliked: - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right - achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved!"
"Pros: +graphic cons: -bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb ai -enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted -godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior. -terrible checkpoints and saves. -boring story that i couldn't care less about will not recommend it unless its 90% off even then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end."
"Review for 29/11/2015 do not buy this game, servers offline. You can't play. No compres este juego, servidores offline. No puedes jugar. While i could play it, i enjoyed it. As the song of the steve miller band...: go on take the money and run uh uh uhhh! go on take the money and run go on take the money and run go on take the money and run https://youtu.be/-wcfugcollu?t=54 --- english - 73 minutes playing the game omfg just an hour in this game! it's awesome! some guns are op and matchmaking it's sometimes unfair, but hey, bf3 it's worse matchmaking a newbie and the higher lvls players weren't real humans, you shot them in the face and nothing happens!"
"Who wouldn't want to wear a fez? :d this puzzle platforming game stars a little guy with a fez who goes around collecting little bits to form a cube and navigating through a fairly large branching map. This game is quite amusing and running through it to complete the game was quite a bit of fun. ^_^ it can become semi-frustrating if you want to get all the cubes and achievements though. To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-). The guide, 'a complete guide to fez!!!'"
"It's not hard for me to see why other people like this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing i have a vive and i'm much more interested in playing room sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe inspiring in the scale of its universe, but i also felt that same scale was a hinderence to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if i were more patient and had more time for gaming this would be compelling to me. But i don't have either and there are plenty more vr games i'd rather spend my time on."
"Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."
"Let me start off by saying i did not purchase eu when it first came out and that i got it on sale which included ew so i never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out. Not sure if i am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people."
"+rpg levelling +wide-variety of ship types +physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +easy-to-learn resource management +dark humored -grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -sub-par ai teammates -low variety of equipment types -low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching) listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for universe is easily the star, but big fight for beef is also very good."
"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the mynba2k17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily vc. #sellout"
"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game. At its core magic the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends you cant earn gold, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo."
"They basically fixed shadow warrior (2013) i.e. The bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as d44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course stan bush's stuff."
"So many things was made wrong. I even dont know how to start this review. This all is refered to mycareer. My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and got already all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends to a person's hight? why a person who has 1.74m can not became so good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? i'm 1.87m in rl, made my first player with this hight and noticed then i can not reach a higher skill than 89. Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
"While i personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and i lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or i'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
"An absolute great stragtegy game! having played every single other wargame (european escalation, and alb), i have to say this one fits well. The number of units are great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!! graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
"I was negatively biased towards this game before i played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though i like science fiction. Boy was i wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel."
Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if your a rpg fan you proubly already have this game.
"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
"So i downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information. Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a cod clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"
"4k+ at 60fps (gtx 970), dual audio options and includes neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skip-able) talking. As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers. No commentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1_"
"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
"English is not my native language. I am dutch. So please ignore any typing/grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review in a few categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability - graphics: the game has been set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick: no unnecussery details. Nice colour-scemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 pentium processor, with nvidia geforce 710m card - 8gb memory and it runs like clockwork (windows 8.1). - controls: the game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an x-box controller."
"You can see by the hours i put into this game that i enjoy it. This is everything i wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. Its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times i hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything. Edit:ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best mp games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling cs:go."
"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
"I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and i learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for uncle fred! if you guys made a dlc or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game."
"Sid meier's civilization beyond earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader."
"Great game ! tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! def. In my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
"02/07/2014 - it's a shame i can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time i've played it,i know i'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. . No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. . Everything artifacts like crazy - the menu's,backgrounds,training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my gpu back to stock and sure enough,it didn't make a difference."
"Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
"'to the moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think telltale's the walking dead is sad? hohoho! well, it's no match for to the moon! never before have i been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the doctor who references are endless."
"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon."
"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun."
"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
"I just started playing, but i love this game. I put on my headphone and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
"The reboot of the devil may cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for series’ protagonist, dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
"Where do i start on this absolutely beautiful game. It's story, is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's. With lots of inspiration from earthbound, one of the best rpg's i have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack i've heard in forever."
"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could."
"Do i even need to explain why portal is amazing? portal is a puzzle game, it gives you a concept then gets out. It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most good popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when i am feeling bored and i love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
"If you can overlook the bugs (which i personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying) edit: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120 and are looking for a space exploration game, i can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, i'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€) radeon rx480 (~200€) z170 pro - gaming (~150€) 16gb ddr4 ram (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled i genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps."
"Remember age of mythology? yeah, it's been that long since there's been an rts game of such quality. Divinity: dragon commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite rts game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, i do like the complicated rts games nowadays. Think of civ v and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."
"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning rpg tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, i'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."
"If you liked witcher 1 and 2, witcher 3 is must to get. I would give normally for this game 10/10 but unfortunatly after 1.03 this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save really often. When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game. I have played over 50 hours now and still going on."
"I have only had this game for a few months, but in just that short amount of time, two dlc's have come out, along with patches that have made an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session i play regardless of how the play-through is going."
"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."
"This game is so.. Very.. Boring. I bought this game because i believed it was a pc version of 'katamari damacy', a popular and nice ps 2 game. Sadly it's far from it. In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
"Alright. Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, i was very interested in this game when i first heard about it. I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
"Fallout 3 story was better. Settlements get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate baby sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My pipboy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous fallout games. Story is medicore, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like fallout 3. Very stable compared to fallout 3. Is it better than fallout 3 no. Is it better than new vegas? no. This title was so overhyped for how bad it actually is."
"My stats (at the time of writing this review): - 8.6 hrs to get to the end - 10 collectibles found out of 25 - zero achievements out of 15 what i liked: - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game what i disliked: - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right - achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved!"
"Pros: +graphic cons: -bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb ai -enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted -godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior. -terrible checkpoints and saves. -boring story that i couldn't care less about will not recommend it unless its 90% off even then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end."
"Review for 29/11/2015 do not buy this game, servers offline. You can't play. No compres este juego, servidores offline. No puedes jugar. While i could play it, i enjoyed it. As the song of the steve miller band...: go on take the money and run uh uh uhhh! go on take the money and run go on take the money and run go on take the money and run https://youtu.be/-wcfugcollu?t=54 --- english - 73 minutes playing the game omfg just an hour in this game! it's awesome! some guns are op and matchmaking it's sometimes unfair, but hey, bf3 it's worse matchmaking a newbie and the higher lvls players weren't real humans, you shot them in the face and nothing happens!"
"Who wouldn't want to wear a fez? :d this puzzle platforming game stars a little guy with a fez who goes around collecting little bits to form a cube and navigating through a fairly large branching map. This game is quite amusing and running through it to complete the game was quite a bit of fun. ^_^ it can become semi-frustrating if you want to get all the cubes and achievements though. To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-). The guide, 'a complete guide to fez!!!'"
"It's not hard for me to see why other people like this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing i have a vive and i'm much more interested in playing room sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe inspiring in the scale of its universe, but i also felt that same scale was a hinderence to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if i were more patient and had more time for gaming this would be compelling to me. But i don't have either and there are plenty more vr games i'd rather spend my time on."
"Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."
"Let me start off by saying i did not purchase eu when it first came out and that i got it on sale which included ew so i never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out. Not sure if i am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people."
"+rpg levelling +wide-variety of ship types +physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +easy-to-learn resource management +dark humored -grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -sub-par ai teammates -low variety of equipment types -low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching) listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for universe is easily the star, but big fight for beef is also very good."
"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the mynba2k17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily vc. #sellout"
"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game. At its core magic the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends you cant earn gold, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo."
"They basically fixed shadow warrior (2013) i.e. The bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as d44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course stan bush's stuff."
"So many things was made wrong. I even dont know how to start this review. This all is refered to mycareer. My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and got already all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends to a person's hight? why a person who has 1.74m can not became so good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? i'm 1.87m in rl, made my first player with this hight and noticed then i can not reach a higher skill than 89. Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
"While i personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and i lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or i'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
"An absolute great stragtegy game! having played every single other wargame (european escalation, and alb), i have to say this one fits well. The number of units are great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!! graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
"I was negatively biased towards this game before i played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though i like science fiction. Boy was i wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel."
Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if your a rpg fan you proubly already have this game.
"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
"So i downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information. Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a cod clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"
"4k+ at 60fps (gtx 970), dual audio options and includes neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skip-able) talking. As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers. No commentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1_"
"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
"English is not my native language. I am dutch. So please ignore any typing/grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review in a few categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability - graphics: the game has been set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick: no unnecussery details. Nice colour-scemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 pentium processor, with nvidia geforce 710m card - 8gb memory and it runs like clockwork (windows 8.1). - controls: the game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an x-box controller."
"You can see by the hours i put into this game that i enjoy it. This is everything i wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. Its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times i hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything. Edit:ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best mp games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling cs:go."
"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
"I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and i learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for uncle fred! if you guys made a dlc or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game."
"Sid meier's civilization beyond earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader."
"Great game ! tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! def. In my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
"02/07/2014 - it's a shame i can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time i've played it,i know i'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. . No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. . Everything artifacts like crazy - the menu's,backgrounds,training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my gpu back to stock and sure enough,it didn't make a difference."
"Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
"'to the moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think telltale's the walking dead is sad? hohoho! well, it's no match for to the moon! never before have i been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the doctor who references are endless."
"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon."
"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun."
"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
"I just started playing, but i love this game. I put on my headphone and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
"The reboot of the devil may cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for series’ protagonist, dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
"Where do i start on this absolutely beautiful game. It's story, is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's. With lots of inspiration from earthbound, one of the best rpg's i have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack i've heard in forever."
"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could."
"Do i even need to explain why portal is amazing? portal is a puzzle game, it gives you a concept then gets out. It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most good popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when i am feeling bored and i love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
"If you can overlook the bugs (which i personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying) edit: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120 and are looking for a space exploration game, i can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, i'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€) radeon rx480 (~200€) z170 pro - gaming (~150€) 16gb ddr4 ram (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled i genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps."
"Remember age of mythology? yeah, it's been that long since there's been an rts game of such quality. Divinity: dragon commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite rts game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, i do like the complicated rts games nowadays. Think of civ v and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."
"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning rpg tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, i'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."
"If you liked witcher 1 and 2, witcher 3 is must to get. I would give normally for this game 10/10 but unfortunatly after 1.03 this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save really often. When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game. I have played over 50 hours now and still going on."
"I have only had this game for a few months, but in just that short amount of time, two dlc's have come out, along with patches that have made an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session i play regardless of how the play-through is going."
"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."
"This game is so.. Very.. Boring. I bought this game because i believed it was a pc version of 'katamari damacy', a popular and nice ps 2 game. Sadly it's far from it. In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
"Alright. Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, i was very interested in this game when i first heard about it. I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
"Fallout 3 story was better. Settlements get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate baby sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My pipboy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous fallout games. Story is medicore, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like fallout 3. Very stable compared to fallout 3. Is it better than fallout 3 no. Is it better than new vegas? no. This title was so overhyped for how bad it actually is."
"My stats (at the time of writing this review): - 8.6 hrs to get to the end - 10 collectibles found out of 25 - zero achievements out of 15 what i liked: - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game what i disliked: - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right - achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved!"
"Pros: +graphic cons: -bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb ai -enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted -godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior. -terrible checkpoints and saves. -boring story that i couldn't care less about will not recommend it unless its 90% off even then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end."
"Review for 29/11/2015 do not buy this game, servers offline. You can't play. No compres este juego, servidores offline. No puedes jugar. While i could play it, i enjoyed it. As the song of the steve miller band...: go on take the money and run uh uh uhhh! go on take the money and run go on take the money and run go on take the money and run https://youtu.be/-wcfugcollu?t=54 --- english - 73 minutes playing the game omfg just an hour in this game! it's awesome! some guns are op and matchmaking it's sometimes unfair, but hey, bf3 it's worse matchmaking a newbie and the higher lvls players weren't real humans, you shot them in the face and nothing happens!"
"Who wouldn't want to wear a fez? :d this puzzle platforming game stars a little guy with a fez who goes around collecting little bits to form a cube and navigating through a fairly large branching map. This game is quite amusing and running through it to complete the game was quite a bit of fun. ^_^ it can become semi-frustrating if you want to get all the cubes and achievements though. To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-). The guide, 'a complete guide to fez!!!'"
"It's not hard for me to see why other people like this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing i have a vive and i'm much more interested in playing room sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe inspiring in the scale of its universe, but i also felt that same scale was a hinderence to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if i were more patient and had more time for gaming this would be compelling to me. But i don't have either and there are plenty more vr games i'd rather spend my time on."
"Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."
"Let me start off by saying i did not purchase eu when it first came out and that i got it on sale which included ew so i never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out. Not sure if i am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people."
"+rpg levelling +wide-variety of ship types +physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +easy-to-learn resource management +dark humored -grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -sub-par ai teammates -low variety of equipment types -low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching) listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for universe is easily the star, but big fight for beef is also very good."
"It puts the ball in the net or it gets the hose again. Absolutely amazing, have nothing negative to say about this game as it's exceeded my expectations and will probably exeed yours too. Fluid movement, bug/crash free, lots of story/content to put you through, options for each and every day such as multiple practices, events (sponsorships) and even games. This review is purely based on playing mycareer, and so far it's 10/10. Facescan worked really well for me (used it two times, first one made me have a downsyndrome forehead though..). Keep in mind, using the mynba2k17 app will allow for you to facescan for free and allow you to earn daily vc. #sellout"
"Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game. At its core magic the gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game winning bombs. Wizards of the coast seems to have forgotten this. If you choose to play with friends you cant earn gold, and gold is important. Gold is so important that they have implemented a daily cap, understandable considering gold unlocks everything in game. But get ready for a long and boring 1v1 grind against the computer or random oponents, whom you can't even speak to. If you choose to play for free, it will take you roughly 4 hours a day for upwards of a month, by yourself, to unlock the cards."
"Being the 3rd installment in the trilogy i'll get the bad stuff out of the way first. I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo."
"They basically fixed shadow warrior (2013) i.e. The bossfights are awesome, weapons feel very nice (maybe not as good as d44m's ones, but still solid), enemies aren't too spongy (if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff). The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game. The music is great, especially the main theme and of course stan bush's stuff."
"So many things was made wrong. I even dont know how to start this review. This all is refered to mycareer. My player is an outside scorer, pg, 1.71m, has maxed stats and got already all necessary perks. Ok, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends to a person's hight? why a person who has 1.74m can not became so good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? i'm 1.87m in rl, made my first player with this hight and noticed then i can not reach a higher skill than 89. Why? thats a pure discrimination! and why the game does not tell me that before i create a char and not even then when i reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?"
"I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
"While i personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea."
"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death leads to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and i lost my main character around hour 10 of 20ish. Would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away... Just one more mission, just one more supply run - or i'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
"An absolute great stragtegy game! having played every single other wargame (european escalation, and alb), i have to say this one fits well. The number of units are great. Not sure exactly how many units there are, but there's a crap ton!!! graphics are just beautiful, sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The ingame chat box at the main menu is very entertaining as well, no i am not kidding. However, if anyone thinking this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Do not get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
"I was negatively biased towards this game before i played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and portals thing seemed weird to me even though i like science fiction. Boy was i wrong. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad. Btw i never played the first portal game. One of these days, i'm planning to if i can spare the time. I would never have played it if i hadn't played the sequel."
Ok lets start on the pros(+) and cons(-) then my thoughts on this game. +some of the best charecters +good story +lods of content +customisible charecter ( you can be male or female whatever you like) +you can have a relationship with most of your companions(yes fangirls you can have a love intrest) -bad graphics ( i dont think graphics really matter anyway) -weird and akward love scenes -invisible walls -theirs one mission in my opinion was boring but everyone has different tastes -+ um this isnt really bad or good but for those who care your protaginist you made cant talk okay know for my thoughts. I love this game. This game is probubly one of the best rpgs or games in general i have ever played.so if your a rpg fan you proubly already have this game.
"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember (at least in the uk) watching the ever-irritating timmy mallet just for the five minute transformers cartoon. The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
"So i downloaded the game and played it for a little while, and it was nothing special. I spent more time trying to log in though than actually playing the game. There is a bug where it says that there was an update to the terms of service or whatever and whenever you clicked 'accept' it would just pop up again. You have to restart the client for it to work. Now that isn't that bad but why do i need to link my steam and gface accounts? they say it is for dlc but why is that even necessary? it is also not reversable so now i know that a company i don't care about has access to my steam information. Now the game itself is so so. It is easily recognisable as a cod clone, except somehow they made the gunplay worse... How is that even possible?"
"4k+ at 60fps (gtx 970), dual audio options and includes neptune gear. What's not to love? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nygsb617tmo excellent port and a great entry point if new to the series. Just keep in mind there is lots of (skip-able) talking. As usual would suggest using a gamepad but personally i had no problems with a keymouse/mouse setup, both completely rebindable. Price is about right and wouldn't have been unhappy about a purchase. More then half the dlc is included free, which is still plenty to play with. Recommended game to all jrpg/anime/visualnovel fans, provided you don't mind long breaks between the action. Cheers. No commentary playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plslfvijaupszez9af395mvnk63xnhsj1_"
"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches it plays really well. Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)"
"Damn fine aaa fps shooter - that's the bottom line. It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable."
"English is not my native language. I am dutch. So please ignore any typing/grammatical mistakes in my review of this fantastic game. I will break down this review in a few categories: - graphics - controls - sound - gameplay - replayability - graphics: the game has been set in a comic-like style. The graphics are very slick: no unnecussery details. Nice colour-scemes. It totally works for this game. The graphics can be set on 'high' without stressing your system. I run this game on an i5 pentium processor, with nvidia geforce 710m card - 8gb memory and it runs like clockwork (windows 8.1). - controls: the game can be played with keyboard and mouse, but also with an x-box controller."
"You can see by the hours i put into this game that i enjoy it. This is everything i wished a search game from cod would be. But dont buy this game thinking its like cod, battlefield, or any other shooter game. Its a game in its own class and should be treated as such. Cant tell you how many times i hear new players ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about getting killed really fast. Oh god forbid you get shot in the face and ♥♥♥♥ing die. It's not like that doents happen in real life or anything. Edit:ok so ive been playing this game for awhile now. Thrown all kinds of money at it. One of the best mp games around. A good thing to play when your your not feeling cs:go."
"I'm 2 hours in and am dying from this game. So funny. Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away... I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much. What a delight so far."
"I'm really sorry, i try to be supportive of free-to-play games and indie developers, but i really didn't enjoy this game. The description sounded right up my alley, but the execution has done nothing for me. I love puzzle and exploration games, but i found this game to be completely unintuitive, and even after looking up how to progress i still just simply didn't find the gameplay itself fun. It also completely lacks a pause button, or if it does have one i never found it. Considering that a lot of sequences in the game are timed, this seems like a critical oversight. I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot."
"This game.... Phew where to even start. It was absolutely beautiful, from story to graphics i was hooked. The story wasnt just some story but actually felt like i was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story that my character was telling. Gameplay was great and i learned alot about myself through this game (mainly my fear of hights which i never had a problem with until the ice caverns). My gut churned the whole time, but i kept through for uncle fred! if you guys made a dlc or second game, i would be the first to buy it and recomend it to everyone i know. Thanks to everyone who was involved making this, you made a absolutely beautiful game."
"Sid meier's civilization beyond earth is a turn-based game in which you build your civilization to a certain goal or 'victory'. In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader."
"Great game ! tons of replayability and very fun zombie survival game ! def. In my top 5 zombie games ever played. Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."
"02/07/2014 - it's a shame i can't thoroughly recommend/enjoy this game as from the short time i've played it,i know i'd be addicted if it didn't have the following 2 game breakers. . No aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage,and creates unbearable lag. Mind you,i played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering/lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping,and it just ruins the game. . Everything artifacts like crazy - the menu's,backgrounds,training and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card and thought it might not like my oc. Set my gpu back to stock and sure enough,it didn't make a difference."
"Very late last night i finished this. The story is not very deep or interesting but what makes it stand out is the story-telling. The atmosphere is filled to the brim and the many collectibles do a great job at fleshing it out. I did learn a lot about the world of batman so it was a little disappointing that so few bosses were in the game. Oh well, there's enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign which add for nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a nice sense of progression."
"'to the moon' is no mere game... Nay, it is a veritable experience, and it was one of the best of my life at that. Think telltale's the walking dead is sad? hohoho! well, it's no match for to the moon! never before have i been so depressed yet fulfilled over something purely fictional. This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the doctor who references are endless."
"Bastion is a bloody brilliant game, with a really great storyline. Set after some calamity happened, you start to rebuild on the bastion. There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon."
"I had originally bought this game in early development, when the only currency was spacebux, and there was no 'tech tree'. This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun."
"This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2d platformer and an moba, and does it with style. I found myself enjoying characters that i wouldn't enjoy in other moba games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, i now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game."
"I just started playing, but i love this game. I put on my headphone and lose myself in the game for hours at a time. It's been awhile since a game has had that effect on me. The music sets the mood, the sound effects are right on, and the controls are perfect. I look forward to every combat, and they've optimized combat extremely well. I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!"
"The reboot of the devil may cry franchise has brought about many changes for the series, particularly for series’ protagonist, dante. While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it’s certainly for the better; and this new game by ninja theory proves it. Dmc serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new dante, making him a compelling character to watch.image the story follows dante as he’s introduced into the corrupt world he willfully chose to ignore."
"Where do i start on this absolutely beautiful game. It's story, is absolutely charming. It has so much detail put into it, and it is a bundle of happiness, bad puns, annoying dogs, secrets. It is serious when it needs to be, but isn't a stranger to funny moments. The character design is on point, with there being various characters with various personailities and secrets to them. It sticks out from other rpg's because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an unused concept in rpg's. With lots of inspiration from earthbound, one of the best rpg's i have seen, you can tell that it is going to be good. It easily has the best soundtrack i've heard in forever."
"I am recommending this solely because it's free, and might be a more 'enjoyable' experience for others. As for my experience, the 'game' did nothing for me. Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe i'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the 'game' took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information i could."
"Do i even need to explain why portal is amazing? portal is a puzzle game, it gives you a concept then gets out. It is an amazing way to test your mind while still being fun. Although this game isn't as story heavy, it did give birth to one of the most good popular games of 2011. I still play this game and beat it when i am feeling bored and i love to come back and to see what gave birth to a legend and what is a legend. Gameplay: portal's gameplay is quite simple, to explain at least. You use portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate a part of the puzzle. Two buttons are in the game, one that you press and one that you need a cube to put on."
"If you can overlook the bugs (which i personally only had two: one minor and the other quite annoying) edit: both bugs are resolved one fix increased my fps from 60-90 to 80-120 and are looking for a space exploration game, i can definitely recommend this. Since most of these reviews are about specs, i'll include mine: i5 6600k (~200€) radeon rx480 (~200€) z170 pro - gaming (~150€) 16gb ddr4 ram (~70€) ~650€ is definitely within the medium price range though, granted, this rig is quite new. Almost constant 60+ fps on high settings vsync enabled i genuinely can't believe 90% of the comments saying they're rocking an overkill setup and get 20fps."
"Remember age of mythology? yeah, it's been that long since there's been an rts game of such quality. Divinity: dragon commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite rts game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, i do like the complicated rts games nowadays. Think of civ v and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode."
"Undertale comes together to make something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning rpg tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, i'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game."
"If you liked witcher 1 and 2, witcher 3 is must to get. I would give normally for this game 10/10 but unfortunatly after 1.03 this game turned into buggy ♥♥♥♥ + random crashes, so remember to save really often. When i played version 1.00 -&gt; 1.03 my game never crashed, i didnt see any bugs. Also i have noticed that after 1.03 patch drawing distance sometimes is horrible, starting to draw objects when youre really close, sometimes even people. But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game. I have played over 50 hours now and still going on."
"I have only had this game for a few months, but in just that short amount of time, two dlc's have come out, along with patches that have made an already great game into an excellent one. The devs are very active in the community, and it really shows in the various discussion forums and dev diaries. There is a fairly steep learning curve to the game's mechanics of which i am still trying to learn; however, this breadth of strategy allows you a myriad of ways to reach goals and take advantage of certain situations. The game, in my mind, is almost infinitely replayable. I find myself sucked into every session i play regardless of how the play-through is going."
"Warframe is a fun game for the first few hours of play. After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out."
"This game is so.. Very.. Boring. I bought this game because i believed it was a pc version of 'katamari damacy', a popular and nice ps 2 game. Sadly it's far from it. In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."
"Alright. Let me explain a few things, as a person very intrested in politics, i was very interested in this game when i first heard about it. I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with. It's the only time its an option to wear your head or not in a campaign. Literally."
"Fallout 3 story was better. Settlements get in the way of the story to the point you'll hate baby sitting them instead of playing the story. Some keys are hard coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs galore. My pipboy disappeared permanently at one point and had to research console commands to get it back. You don't have to work for power armor it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game and power cores are everywhere in trader shops. Value of power armor diminished greatly from previous fallout games. Story is medicore, everything about this game is mediocre except it doesn't crash every 10 mins like fallout 3. Very stable compared to fallout 3. Is it better than fallout 3 no. Is it better than new vegas? no. This title was so overhyped for how bad it actually is."
"My stats (at the time of writing this review): - 8.6 hrs to get to the end - 10 collectibles found out of 25 - zero achievements out of 15 what i liked: - visuals up until the last level (ice caves) - story is not that great, but the ending (after the closing credits) kind of made me not regret so much spending my time playing this game what i disliked: - visuals in the last level are uninteresting - gameplay in the last level gets much harder making it become a frustrating experience of having to do a lot of things over and over again until you get it right - achievements are too hard. There are 13 (out of 15) that only less than 2,1% of players achieved!"
"Pros: +graphic cons: -bugs(especially the environment, you may get stuck or your shots may hit a invisible wall despite having clear line of sight of the enemy) -game is handholding/ babysitting you -dumb ai -enemies always seem to know where you are when you are spotted -godlike accuracy by the enemy which is frustrating like the first ghost warrior. -terrible checkpoints and saves. -boring story that i couldn't care less about will not recommend it unless its 90% off even then i find playing this game to be an extremely boring chore, just playing for the sake of finishing it to move unto the next game in my library. Considering the time i wasted on the first ghost warrior (which was equally boring and i feel liberated when i finished it), i probably won't play it until the end."
"Review for 29/11/2015 do not buy this game, servers offline. You can't play. No compres este juego, servidores offline. No puedes jugar. While i could play it, i enjoyed it. As the song of the steve miller band...: go on take the money and run uh uh uhhh! go on take the money and run go on take the money and run go on take the money and run https://youtu.be/-wcfugcollu?t=54 --- english - 73 minutes playing the game omfg just an hour in this game! it's awesome! some guns are op and matchmaking it's sometimes unfair, but hey, bf3 it's worse matchmaking a newbie and the higher lvls players weren't real humans, you shot them in the face and nothing happens!"
"Who wouldn't want to wear a fez? :d this puzzle platforming game stars a little guy with a fez who goes around collecting little bits to form a cube and navigating through a fairly large branching map. This game is quite amusing and running through it to complete the game was quite a bit of fun. ^_^ it can become semi-frustrating if you want to get all the cubes and achievements though. To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-). The guide, 'a complete guide to fez!!!'"
"It's not hard for me to see why other people like this game, but it wasn't for me. For one thing i have a vive and i'm much more interested in playing room sized games with the controllers. Beyond that, the game is initially awe inspiring in the scale of its universe, but i also felt that same scale was a hinderence to my enjoyment. The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me. Perhaps if i were more patient and had more time for gaming this would be compelling to me. But i don't have either and there are plenty more vr games i'd rather spend my time on."
"Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags. You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."
"Let me start off by saying i did not purchase eu when it first came out and that i got it on sale which included ew so i never experienced the issues that some people claim to have had with that game. I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out. Not sure if i am just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from some really entitled people."
"+rpg levelling +wide-variety of ship types +physics-based movement for both ships and projectiles/missles +easy-to-learn resource management +dark humored -grind intensive (if under utilizing the civvy station types) -sub-par ai teammates -low variety of equipment types -low variety of levelling skills (that is, no branching) listen, this game is fun as hell. Despite my minuses up there, there is still some variety and strategy to be had. It starts off fast and still really picks up. Even though there's a low variety of equipment, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is the mods. Fight for universe is easily the star, but big fight for beef is also very good."
"Soon, the average American is going to be able to get a prescription for a drug to help treat a wide range of medical conditions, including treating depression, autism and epilepsy.

The FDA approved the first new drug in decades to treat Parkinson's disease, a movement disorder that affects the brain and causes patients to tremble and have trouble walking.

The drug, sold by the California-based biotechnology company Biogen Idec, could be available in the market in 2018, and in the U.S. in the following five years, according to the company.

The approval of the drug could spur moves to expand access to drugs to treat Parkinson's disease, which affects around 20 million people worldwide.

The approval could also mark a watershed moment for the drug industry, which has struggled to develop new drugs to treat the disease.

But the approval could be controversial, since the FDA has previously approved drugs to treat Parkinson's that were also marketed for other conditions, such as depression.

In 2014, the FDA approved an antidepressant called duloxetine for depression, after approving a drug called venlafaxine for other purposes previously.

""This is a big deal,"" said Matthew J. Grob, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. ""It's been a long time coming.""

The approval prompted a reaction from the Parkinson's community, which had been hopeful the FDA would approve the drug for other conditions, such as Parkinson's.

""This is a historic day and it is a great step forward in the fight against Parkinson's disease,"" said Dr. Robert Sapolsky, a professor of neurology at Columbia University in New York City. ""But I'm very concerned that this approval means we will be stuck with the same old drugs for many years to come.""

In 2015, Parkinson's disease took the lives of at least 2.5 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

There are more than 60 drugs in development for the disease, and roughly 20 have been approved for use in the U.S.

The approval of Biogen Idec's drug, which is based on a drug company's work, could lead to other drugs for the disease, Grob said.

""It's a big deal,"" said Dr. Robert P. Frick, a professor of neurology and neurology surgery at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. ""It's a big deal for the system.""

Frick said he wouldn't like to see the approval of the drug for Parkinson's remain just for Parkinson's.

""If it's going to treat other conditions, I wish it would go to other diseases,"" he said.

The approval of the drug, called gabapentin, comes as the FDA is reviewing the use of the drug to treat neuropathy, a condition"
"I've been reading a lot of fanfic lately so i thought I'd share my favourite and i hope you enjoy it! Thank you for letting the author know how much you like her work!

I never met a man who didn't like to dream. He was a man with a dream, a dream that stretched back years. He'd been at the Academy for so long that he didn't need to attend the many different schools here. They all needed to know each other; they were all a part of one great plan.

The day finally came when he would be allowed to leave.

It'd be a short ride, but he'd remember the drive. He'd get too excited to walk it alone. No one else had been allowed out this late and it was the perfect time for it. The Academy was only a small community, spread out over a series of small locations: the Academy and a small, secluded village, the Academy itself, several small houses, and finally the old house itself.

Once he'd had his fill of the scenery, he'd take a deep breath, stretch his legs out, and then finally step out of the little house he shared with his mother. He'd be back in his room for the first time for quite some time, but he didn't plan on staying. He'd take a shower, pack up some clothes, and he'd take a nap. It didn't take long before he'd awake and get dressed. Walking down the hall to the cafeteria, however, he stumbled against his older brother who was heading straight for his.

""Kee!""

""What?""

""How'd you get my bag?""

""I didn't get it!"" Dee yelled, getting so upset he almost fell over in the process.

""We're supposed to get everyone's bags for the rest of the year, but because we got a surprise, you just got two bags instead of one. It looks like we're going to have to start paying attention to each other."" He said with a bit of a frown, but with a hint of sympathy. Dee sighed and walked off.

When Dee walked into her room, a pair of clothes lay on her bed. She glanced at them, then noticed a small badge pinned to the back of them.

The badge was silver while the two symbols around it both read ""Lifelong Loyalty.""

Dee chuckled a bit under her breath. She was sure the badge was special, it definitely looked good on her. But, as soon as she took a step closer, she noticed the symbol was actually a symbol that had been passed down through so many generations. It was the symbol the Academy sent as a sort of sign of the academy's trust in its members, like the golden lion logo. However, when she'd examined the badge for any mention that was specific to her, she couldn"
"""I've been in the refugee resettlement business for over 30 years. I've heard some of the most absurd and offensive things, but nothing is as disgusting as what I heard last night from a group of Obama supporters. Their idea of compassion is to throw a child off a baseball field,"" the pastor said in a Facebook post on his website."
"In case you missed it, here's the recap of the weekend. The Bears are outscored 60-14 in their last 3 possessions and the Lions are up 6 with 11 minutes left.

I'm going to make no prediction (which is my weakness), but it seems the Lions will be able to hold on and get a win against the Bears.

The following players also got in on the action, and their performance helped move us further along into victory lane:

Lions –

Toben Gaydosh – 10

Anthony Zettel – 9

Michael Burton – 5

Eric Ebron – 4

Matt Prater – 2

Dwayne Washington – 2

Darius Slay – 2

The Lions offense was extremely disappointing as they couldn't get anything going on offense and ended up only scoring 7 points the entire game. Calvin Johnson was on fire today, but the Lions defense has been giving them trouble for weeks.

Bears –

Matt Forte – 29

Alshon Jeffery – 10

Jordan Howard – 9

Charles Johnson – 5

Trey Burton – 5

Martellus Bennett – 3

Jay Cutler – 3

Jordan Howard – 3

Buck Allen – 3

Jordan Howard had a fairly good day, and it didn't end badly when the Giants decided to score a touchdown, but the Bears defense allowed a couple touchdowns to run.

The Bears offense looked pretty solid on offense with the only real mistakes coming from Howard and Cutler.

"The BBC's only transgender presenter has announced she is to leave the corporation after more than 25 years.

Giselle is a former model and freelance presenter who joined the BBC in 1991, becoming a regular presenter for Radio 1Xtra.

Her current contract with the corporation ends at Christmas.

She said: ""I am leaving the BBC as a result of a decision made by the BBC Trust.

""I have been in a position of great trust at the BBC over the last 25 years, and I regret that this trust has now been breached by the BBC Trust.

""I have always been the BBC's top transgender presenter and I have realised that I no longer have the trust of the BBC Trust.""

The BBC said it would not comment on individual staff departures.

Giselle, who is also a former Miss Wales, said she had been offered an interim position with BBC Radio 4.

""At this time, I am looking at this opportunity,"" she said.

""I am still looking for a great BBC job and, if I do find it, I will be looking to return to work at the BBC.""

She added: ""I will continue to be a voice for the trans community.""

In a statement, the BBC said Giselle was ""a highly respected broadcaster with a strong track record"".

""She has been part of a number of successful commissions and has been a key contributor to the BBC's diversity initiatives,"" it added.

""Giselle was fully supportive of the BBC Trust's decision to invite her to apply for a new role at the broadcaster.""

The BBC Trust, which is appointed by the Labour leader, said: ""The BBC is a global public service broadcaster and we treat all of our employees fairly and with respect.

""We are committed to supporting diversity in the workplace and in the BBC.

""We have already received a number of applications for various senior roles at the BBC and, at the appropriate time, we will take those applications forward.""

The BBC has long been criticised for being failing to employ a single transgender person.

In 2013, the BBC Trust found that the corporation was failing on the diversity front, with just one transgender employee in its senior management ranks and no BBC Trust-approved lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) work.

In 2015, the Labour MP for Leicester East, Sarah Champion, launched a campaign to tackle the lack of LGBT representation and introduce LGBT-inclusive quotas in the BBC.

A year later, the corporation published its first LGBT-inclusive employment policy.

However, it failed to address the issue of diversity on its broadcast team, with just one transgender person in senior posts.

The BBC Trust's report found that while more than half of all BBC staff are white, over a third are female and the majority are from"
"The Denver Broncos have signed undrafted free agent receiver Mohamed Massaquoi, according to a source.

Massaquoi was a former wide receiver at Wisconsin and was projected to be a second-day draft pick. Some experts felt he could have gone in the late first round, but the Broncos chose a receiver in the third round in 2014.

The Broncos are low on depth at wide receiver after the team traded Demaryius Thomas to the Denver Broncos.

The 6-foot-4, 215-pound Massaquoi has 4.44 speed in the 40-yard dash and is a good route runner.

He caught 53 passes for 781 yards and three touchdowns in his career.

The Broncos are still in the process of signing their fifth-round pick, wide receiver Ricardo Lockette."
"We've heard it before: The U.S. is losing its power and influence in today's world.

It's not just the Obama administration's ""pivot to Asia"" that is underperforming, the U.S. will not be as attractive to potential partners.

Indeed, if it fails to change its mindset, the U.S. will continue to lose its ability to lead and it will be left vulnerable in the global system.

According to a new study from the German Marshall Fund, a think tank specializing in international policy, the U.S. has already lost the trust and confidence of its partners by ignoring the important, fundamental questions about trade and geopolitics that concern the countries in the region.

Rather than pursuing open trade with the world, the U.S. is now trying to win a trade deal by opening a trade dispute.

The U.S. is currently in the middle of trying to negotiate a trade deal with the European Union. The trade agreement will also include Australia, which has already expressed interest, as well as China.

""A global economy with high trade barriers in place would harm the U.S. economy by undermining demand and weakening its bargaining position. For example, higher trade costs between the EU and the U.S., and Japan and the U.S., would be passed on to American consumers,"" says Daniel Hourihan, the author of the report, titled ""Why Is The U.S. Not Negotiating Global Trade Agreements With Other Countries?""

When the U.S. negotiated NAFTA and CETA it had to overcome a huge lobby representing manufacturers from the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The U.S. was faced with a strong and vocal lobbying effort which was backed by several lobbies representing multinational agribusiness corporations.

The study also found that there is no evidence of the benefits of free trade agreements, in terms of employment, for U.S. workers. It cited numerous studies of its benefits (see here and here).

Furthermore, the study says free trade agreements, such as TTIP, TAFTA (the Trade in Services Agreement) and TPP (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) will not promote job creation. The deal would create too many jobs to create a positive role for America; not only would TTIP make American workers in the middle class worse off, but it would create very few jobs for Americans, in the long run.

In addition, the study says the U.S. trade deficit is unsustainable and will become a serious problem in the years to come for the international economy.

In fact, according to the study:

If the U.S. were to reduce these trade deficits by $900 billion in the next 15 years, it would reduce its gross domestic product by $11.1 trillion in the following decade. Similarly, it would reduce its GDP"
"In recent days, I have discussed the implications of the Senate Republicans' repeal bill on the American people, including how it will affect low-income people who need subsidized health insurance. In addition, I discuss the various possible solutions that can be introduced to prevent the bill from having such devastating effects on the American health care system.

It's important to note that any solution to these problems of the American health care system must begin with repealing the current law and replacing it with meaningful reform. There are many different ideas on how the solution should be put in place, including allowing Medicare Part D recipients to retain their coverage. However, the most realistic solution to the underlying problem lies in allowing people with pre-existing conditions to keep coverage while repealing the Affordable Care Act.

Despite the fact that the Senate Republicans' health care plan repeals the Affordable Care Act and takes away insurance coverage for millions of people, those very same people still remain in the health care system and receive care from the health care providers they've been waiting years to have treated them. As such, any solution that would allow people with pre-existing conditions to continue paying for their health care without having to pay out of pocket would provide real relief for the sickest citizens in society.

Many people do not know the extent to which, to a large extent, health care is rationed in this country. In America today, our health care system is so expensive that the insurance companies are essentially required to pay for people at all of the health care providers that the sickest citizens see. For most lower-income Americans, there are not enough private doctors and hospitals to treat everyone, and those that can only treat sicker patients. For the people who would like to visit a doctor, it's often simply impossible to do so because most doctors and hospitals are forced to turn away people because they cannot afford to see them, or they refuse to see someone because they may be too expensive to treat.

This means that the entire system is stacked, and many people have no way of realizing that they are paying for people who might end up dying, because not only are they not getting seen, but also they are being forced to choose between the cost of visiting a nurse who might treat them and the cost of treating an expensive health care plan that isn't actually helping them.

As someone who knows first-hand about the effect government rationing has on health care, I've made it a personal goal to eliminate this problem entirely. In order to achieve this goal, my proposal would do one important thing: it would allow people with preexisting conditions to be able to keep their coverage without having to pay higher premiums or out of pocket costs.

Accordingly, the Affordable Care Act, in its current form, mandates that every health care provider must offer coverage to anyone living in the country for more than two months. People living in rural areas may not have many medical practitioners or hospitals to choose from"

"From the author of the ""Southern Comfort"" series comes the latest book to help you recover from a major life event. The book, ""Unbroken: The Story of My Life and the Emotions That Keep Me Running,"" tells the story of the author's journey from a sorority to the highest levels of the corporate world. It tells of his attempts to overcome the pain of leaving his wife and children and of coming to terms with the death of his father, as well as his love for his son and his desire to give back to his community.


In addition to a gripping narrative of a life-changing event, the book explores the author's internal struggles with anxiety and depression, and offers solutions to overcoming both. Each chapter in the book is a powerful story about overcoming obstacles.


The author's experiences of sudden loss are explored in the last two chapters, when he ultimately finds peace and courage. The author's former life as a member of the Alpha Phi sorority offers a glimpse into his romantic life and the healing power of support. The author reflects on his adoption of a cat and the lessons he learned about caring for a pet that have helped him to overcome a traumatic event in his life. And, finally, the author discusses why he thinks that the story of his life is the most important one he could tell.


This book is necessary reading for anyone who has experienced a major life event."
"To understand the impact that the nuclear winter scenario will have on the climate we need to consider the energy consumption of the world. This paper reviews how the effective consumption of energy (the total energy used in the economy) will change with the nuclear winter scenario. The model used to estimate this effective consumption is based on the world energy consumption patterns from 1961 to 2012, with the nuclear winter scenario applied. The results suggest that the effective consumption of energy will decrease by more than three times with the nuclear winter scenario."

"A top executive at the nation's second largest health insurance company is suing the state of Ohio in hopes of changing ""the structure and the rules of the market.""

The state is suing Anthem, which is in the process of merging with Cigna. Cigna will take Ohio's Blue Cross Blue Shield business in its exchange system, but the Ohio law bars those involved in the merger from having any financial interest in Cigna.

RELATED: CVS sues Ohio to overturn state ban on merger

Anthem filed the lawsuit Friday, just hours after the state's attorney general, Mike DeWine, announced legislation to stop the merger. Legislators say that legislation is necessary ""to prevent Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and the rest of the combined group from 'gaming' the tax code"" by using company profits in the state to evade the ban. The law's backers want Anthem, Cigna and other companies to pay the state the value of the deal, which is just over $40 billion. If they don't, they'll be able to avoid paying.

In a response to the lawsuit, the state accuses Anthem of violating the state's laws ""particularly with respect to the tax base under this statute that is the primary driver of the public's ability to purchase health care,"" according to the complaint. Ohio's laws have a separate ban on ""any employee or employee group beneficiary of a publicly traded corporation who is a financial interest"" in the state health care exchange.

RELATED: Blue Cross/Blue Shield seeks tax breaks for Anthem and Cigna deals

In a statement, Anthem said, ""We believe the laws have been wrongly interpreted. To date, the state does not have any information supporting their assertion that the Anthem-Cigna merger poses a financial threat to state consumers or their state budget.""

DeWine said the tax loophole is just too big to ignore. ""This is a problem for Ohioans and it's a problem for taxpayers,"" he said.

The two companies' lawsuits differ on whether Cigna is actually a public company, or whether Ohio's ban on ""financial interest"" in businesses is actually constitutional under the state constitution.

Anthem's lawsuit says the state's ban violates the state constitution because public corporations such as Cigna ""are not shielded"" by state law from certain financial disclosures and ""are clearly public.""

Cigna was sold to private equity firm Apollo Global Management a year ago for about $49 billion at a profit, raising $37 billion.

Anthem's lawsuit says Ohio's state constitution protects private corporations ""from being compelled to make reports to the state"" and notes that the ban applies to Ohio public universities and colleges as well. The company's legal case says the state's tax laws in effect prior to the merger make the state's actions unconstitutional.

Cigna did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"The man who took part in the deadly Paris terror attack has lived in Britain for five years, his lawyer claimed, as he defended his presence in Britain by claiming he had already been investigated twice for links to radical Islam.

Salah Abdeslam, a Belgian of Algerian origin who arrived in London after the Paris attacks on November 13, said he had not yet been questioned by police.

The 27-year-old was identified as the attacker who was seen being questioned by cops during a high-speed chase through the streets of Paris last night.

Yesterday the Belgian fugitive was released, saying that he was now 'fine'. His lawyer said he was a victim of false information – the story he told in a Brussels court on November 4, saying that he was in Belgium waiting to catch the airport shuttle to go to Syria to join the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or IS. Then two days later he said he'd made a mistake.

But today the lawyer for Salah, Samir Belkhout, claimed his client's 'underlying intentions' had not been'reassured' at the start of the hearing, and he was'very concerned' about the authorities keeping him 'hidden from everybody'.

Salah Abdeslam, 27, said he 'had not yet been questioned by police', as his case continued in an appeal hearing today in Belgium

In the Belgian courtroom today, the Belgian jihadist who was involved in the deadly Paris terror attacks had to be escorted out when he made controversial comments about the case

Salah Abdeslam was arrested by police after the high-speed chase, during which he allegedly blew himself up outside a metro station – a claim his lawyer said was untrue

Salah Abdeslam (right) was released from custody yesterday after being questioned earlier in the day

'I have never yet said that he is innocent. His thoughts about the case are very serious. He was only released yesterday because there were doubts as to whether he had any involvement in the attacks,' Mr Belkhout told BBC's World Today.

French authorities said on Wednesday the attacks in Paris were carried out by a man with Syrian passport papers Mohamed Abrini, 35. The authorities now believe Salah, 27, was also involved in the plot that killed at least 120 people.

In an appeal hearing in Belgium on Wednesday, Mr Belkhout said that he had been asked several questions about his life, but that he had denied ever having been a fighter in Syria, while saying 'he was not a terrorist or a extremist'.

A French police officer was killed when a man with links to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) carried out a car attack along several motorways near Paris last night.

His identity has since been confirmed by Belgium police sources.

"""My husband is a huge fan of the Avengers, so when he mentioned that he'd love to see the movie, I was excited to tell him about the game,"" said Shara Hayes, a 32-year-old transgender woman from Calgary, Alberta.

Hayes told CBC News that she's been a big fan of the Avengers since the 1990s, when the movie came out.

""I love the movie and I love the book series,"" she said.

Hayes, who transitioned from male to female earlier this year, said she was always interested in the Avengers, but wanted to play the game for a long time, because of the characters' diversity.

""I thought I would do it with a group of people who would be like me, and think like me,"" she said.

Hayes said she was thrilled when her husband, who's an avid gamer, told her that he would like to play the game in the Avengers game store in Calgary.

Shara Hayes was reunited with her husband in Colorado last week, when he bought her an Avengers game at the store. (Shara Hayes)

The couple — like many others who play the game — have expressed their appreciation for the Avengers' role in the LGBT community.

Alyssa Dallas, a 16-year-old transgender student in Colorado, said the Avengers have been a source of inspiration for herself and other transgender youth.

""I've learned that you can be anything you want to be and that it doesn't matter what people think of you, just be yourself,"" she said.

""I feel like everyone should be proud of who they are and be proud of who they are. So, if you want to be an Avenger, if you're a woman, if you're a man, if you're a black person, if you're a white person, if you're a gay person, then you're an Avenger.""

In the game, players can choose to play as their favorite superheroes or villains, and can even choose to join the Avengers themselves.

Alyssa Dallas said she learned that playing the game with her friends was an excellent way to learn about different identities. (Alyssa Dallas)

According to the game's website, the Avengers game was the first movie in which transgender characters were portrayed on screen.

The Avengers are led by Captain America, aka Steve Rogers, who is a man in a woman's body.

Captain America is a leading member of the superhero team known as the Avengers. (Avengers: Age of Ultron)

The first sequel to the movie, the Avengers: Age of Ultron, will arrive in theaters on May 1, 2015.

"The United States spends more on its military than all but four countries, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The U.S. spent $528 billion on Defense in 2013, compared to $312 billion in Russia and $254 billion in China.

In terms of raw dollars, that's a huge discrepancy: the U.S. is $600 billion ahead of Russia, and $300 billion ahead of China.

The U.S. also has the largest military budget in the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The U.S. spends about 1.6% of its GDP on its military, while Russia spends 0.3%.

The U.S. Navy is the largest military force in the world, with 13,500 ships and aircraft. China has more than 10 times that number, with more than 1.3 million naval and air personnel.

The United States also leads the world in military spending on equipment, far outpacing any other country.

The U.S. military spends more on its own equipment than any other nation. The U.S. government owns more than half of all U.S. military equipment.

The Pentagon is also the only government agency that can order and deploy weapons systems.

While the U.S. military spends more than any other country, it's also far less equipped than the rest of the world.

The U.S. military doesn't have any nuclear weapons. Russia, which has had a nuclear arsenal for more than 70 years, has more than half a million nuclear weapons.

The U.S. also doesn't have any aircraft carriers, the biggest warship in the world. Russia, which has one of the largest fleets in the world, has the largest carrier fleet in the world with 40.

The U.S. has a smaller navy than Russia, but their fleets are more technologically advanced.

The U.S. has more than 5,000 aircraft, but Russia has more than 4,000, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The U.S. has fewer satellites in orbit than Russia has in orbit.

In terms of naval ships, Russia has more than three times as many as the U.S.

The U.S. has more drones than Russia — more than 500.

The U.S. has more aircraft carriers than Russia has aircraft carriers.

The U.S. has more aircraft than Russia, but Russia has more active aircraft, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

"What is your favourite Star Wars character? Do you have a favourite Jedi from the Prequels? We would love to hear your thoughts on both this year's Star Wars: Episode VII and beyond, so let us know what you think about The Force Awakens, this year's X-Men: Apocalypse and everything else in the comments below!

Star Wars is one of the biggest and most successful franchises in the world today. It has been the subject of four full movies and an almost endless amount of merchandise, from video games, to board games, toys, toys to life (see: Force Awakens: Life is Better Than Star Wars).

Over the last few years the world has been gripped by the news that another film in the Star Wars saga was at last in development. This news came as a bit of a surprise to many, but it seems as though this new film is all set to be released in the late of next year.

It will mark the return of Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels, along with an even bigger cast of famous guests!

The news of this new movie was met by a lot of excitement from the fans, with one fan commenting that this new Star Wars film will be one of the most anticipated movies of this year. However, there was also some opposition to the news from some fans, who were worried about how Disney are going to take on such a massive property so quickly. If this new movie follows in the footsteps of the Prequels, there will be a lot of criticism of the filmmakers, who will be criticised for not spending the time to tell a richer story.

So if you have been planning to see this new film then do you think it will be worth it? Or is there some other movie on the shelf that you would rather see instead?

Let us know your thoughts below!"
"Pelosi, Reid, and Obama are pushing the ""bipartisan"" deal:

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra on Thursday morning accused the Republicans of ""political gamesmanship"" in their latest effort to pass legislation allowing President Obama to negotiate with the nation's largest banks and corporations on a ""fiscal cliff"" of budget cuts and tax increases. Becerra, D-Calif., said Democrats will push a ""no-confidence vote"" against Republicans on Friday in what he called a ""sad day"" for the Democratic Party. The vote will give Democrats the majority to force Republicans to accept a final legislation or face a party-wide revolt. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was expected to sign off on the resolution Thursday. Obama also called for unity during a news conference after a meeting of Cabinet of White House advisers.

"It was just a few weeks ago that I made the acquaintance of the best-selling, award winning, award winning cookbook authors, Joy of Cooking. She's also the former Food and Wine Editor at The New York Times, and won a James Beard Foundation ""Best Chef: Southeast"" award. We talked about her upcoming book, In the Kitchen with Joy of Cooking, and other food-related topics, and this is what she had to say:


The idea of cooking for people, or being in charge of other people's food, has been with us since the dawn of civilization. A lot of that is rooted in what we eat for dinner. What we eat at home is something we put together ourselves to get all the benefits from a dish, but it's also something we eat because we trust that it's going to be a dish we can get together together, or something we can put together for the whole family. We're not making the food that we eat look prettier or sell more than something else, but that doesn't mean you can't do something with them.


In her book, Joy of Cooking is looking at food as both art and science, and looking at what we can do and how we can learn more about our food from science than from art or tradition. You know when you go to a Michelin-starred restaurant like New York City's Le Pavillon? A lot of that is because the food in there is so different than your typical Michelin-starred restaurant. The chefs make the food and it tastes like their food, so they're able to take a product they're not as familiar with, and find a flavor match that works for them. When you buy a piece of meat, you don't know how it's going to taste at first, because it's different from the ingredients you're familiar with.


That's the best part at New York's Le Pavillon, the same thing that happens when you go to the restaurant called Le Bouc. When you sit down to a piece of meat and it's very different from the other food you're used to, then I think all the chefs who do the preparation feel that this is a challenge, and they put an effort into putting something together that fits with the flavor of the meat. They put it together to make it a part of the experience.


Cooking a large piece of meat is a whole different thing from cooking a small piece of meat. In order to get a piece and a side together that's edible, there's a few extra steps and a lot of effort. That experience you're having with your food is something you have to cultivate as a cook. Even when you're eating at home and cooking in a way that doesn't involve other people, you have to go through that same process of learning and understanding what you're eating so that you can make better informed choices with your own food or that of other people."
"The U.S. military is planning to provide advanced training and technology for Ukrainian forces in a bid to help them defeat Russian-backed separatists, The Washington Post reported Monday night, citing U.S. officials briefed on U.S. plans but not authorized to publicly discuss them.

According to the Post, the Ukrainian government had requested assistance, possibly including sniper training, but was unable to get a response from the United States. On Monday, Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of Central Command, told The New York Times that Ukraine had requested a special-forces exercise to help it fight pro-Russian separatists backed by Moscow.

""We have a long-standing partnership with them,"" Austin said, ""and we will continue to work with them in a timely fashion on training.""

Ukrainians have reportedly turned down training from the U.S.-trained Georgian, Serbian or Afghan military because they don't trust them.

According to the report from The Washington Post, U.S. officials plan to provide Ukraine with advanced communications, navigation and intelligence systems. Kiev had been trying to hire the U.S. company Raytheon to build those systems.

The Post reported that Ukrainian lawmakers had also asked the U.S. military for the ability to take over control of the Ukrainian military's missile defense systems at the battalion level. If the U.S. doesn't act, the Ukrainian military will essentially be turned over to its Russian ally, as The Post's report described it.

The Pentagon's response, so far, had been to provide Ukraine with U.S.-made anti-tank missiles, the Post reported.

The military said in a statement to the Associated Press that it ""is prepared to provide more training if the Ukrainian government requests it.""

The report of U.S. assistance in Ukraine comes as the Obama administration grapples with how to confront Russia about Moscow's military activity in Ukraine, as well as what to do about the Syrian civil war and other problems in the Middle East and Europe.

The U.S. is leading international negotiations on the Syrian civil war, but Russia has said it won't attend. The U.S. has also been pressing to improve the quality of its intelligence on Iran, but Tehran isn't doing that, either.

"The government of Israel is considering legal action against a Palestinian man who says he was deported back to the West Bank to serve out his sentence for throwing stones at an Israeli military jeep.

The man, who said he was named Sa'd Abu Thaher, was arrested in November 2010 while on his way to an army base to return to his village in the West Bank to serve a 15-year jail sentence for throwing stones at an Israeli military jeep. He was released from prison last year after serving a few months, and in January 2011 he was given a new 15-year-sentence for stone throwing.

He was allowed to return to his village in the West Bank, but was sent back to the Gaza Strip, where he was arrested and sent back to prison.

Sa'd Abu Thaher said he was released from prison in January 2011 but only after several months in administrative detention, which Israel uses to hold Palestinian detainees without charge or trial.

Israel has denied that it uses administrative detention, and said it did not have the authority to deport prisoners to areas they are not permitted to visit.

Sa'd Abu Thaher said that he was not allowed to see his family. He was deported from Gaza to the West Bank in April 2012 and was sent back to prison once again.

Last week, the Israeli government decided to ban the transfer of prisoners to the Gaza Strip.

Israel has also applied a new policy that requires detainees to be kept in isolation, a practice that has been criticized by human rights organizations.

"The use of the word ""virus"" has taken on new meaning since the Ebola outbreak. Now, the virus is a ""threat multiplier"" that can cause more harm than good. That is the conclusion of a new study by scientists at the University of Missouri and the University of Texas.

The researchers say there is a growing body of evidence that the virus is spreading in the world's health care system.

""The virus is a threat multiplier that should be treated as an infectious agent,"" lead author Jonathan M. Dillon, assistant professor of microbiology and molecular genetics, said in a news release.

The study, published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, found that Ebola patients in four countries who were not treated with an experimental Ebola vaccine had similar levels of hemorrhagic fever spots on their own skin, but had a greater number of hemorrhagic fever spots on the body of a healthy volunteer.

The findings suggest that Ebola patients who receive an experimental vaccine or immune serum from a donor with Ebola-like symptoms may have a greater risk of hemorrhagic fever spots on their own skin. The researchers did not test the virus on healthy volunteers.

These findings may not be a surprise to those who have followed the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where between February and July of this year, more than 11,000 people have been infected with the virus. The Ebola outbreak has been linked to an increase in the number of reported deaths.

[CDC: Ebola treatment centers will be equipped with the equipment needed to handle the disease]

The virus was first identified in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has killed more than 11,000 people. It is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of infected people and by direct contact with corpses. The outbreak has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

The Ebola outbreak has been linked to an increase in the number of reported deaths. This map shows the areas affected by the Ebola virus in West Africa, which has been the epicenter of the viral outbreak. (Reuters)

In the United States, the first Ebola patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, was diagnosed in Dallas in late August. Duncan died July 26 after being treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and the National Institutes of Health.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a travel alert for all U.S. citizens with possible exposure to Ebola.

Vaccines for Ebola have been available in the United States since the fall of 2014. But the experimental Ebola vaccine was not designed to prevent infection in people who already had Ebola, the researchers say.

Mozambique and Senegal have now received the experimental vaccine, but experts say it is too early to determine whether it is safe to distribute in those countries. They also caution that the vaccine is not yet proven to be effective in preventing transmission of the virus.

""I don't like to use commercial products in my products. There are so many companies working on this product all the time. They make it by hand in their kitchen and you can get the same thing from them. So for me it is a matter of safety, which is why I don't sell it.""

This may be true, but this has not stopped a number of people who have tried Salazar's chili powder from buying other companies's. But, for me, this is a personal preference, and I don't think anyone would call the flavor anything but good.

How to Make Salazar Chili Powder

A simple way to make Salazar chili powder would be to cut all ingredients into small pieces; add some water, then let the spice sit for a few hours, stirring occasionally. As you add more water, the spices won't dissolve the way they will with a simple pot, and may even get slightly darker.

You can also start with a powder that contains the ingredients you want. If you wanted it to contain paprika, for example, all you need to do is add about 1 1/2 teaspoons. If you want cumin, add one teaspoon. If you want cinnamon, add another teaspoon. When you add more water, they will blend together and create a delicious tasting concoction.

There is one little warning about cooking with chili powder. You must never allow the contents to dry out. If you do, you can have a bad, bitter taste. As you see in the pictures below, the mixture is still quite hot, and will keep you satisfied.

How to Buy Ricardo Salazar Chili Powder

It makes a good gift for your favorite chili lovers. It will make the meal for anyone with a strong dislike of chili. It can be a very handy spice for anyone who hates garlic, such as Mexican cooks. It has been used to cook pork, and it makes a great blend in Mexican dishes. If you enjoy spice, this is a great choice. You can also see a recipe for how to make homemade taco seasoning.

"This article is about the concept. For other uses, see Eureka (disambiguation)

Eureka, also known as the ""Eureka Event"", is an event that occurs all over the world once in a while. It is a reoccurring phenomenon where a large number of anomalies appear around a city, which are usually related to an unknown event. They are usually caused by a aliens or a man-made disaster.

Contents show]

History Edit

Eureka was first reported in the 1800s on the Island of Manhattan. It was triggered by an earthquake that struck Manhattan. After this event, it has been trigger after other earthquakes and a number of other disasters. The only reason it is not a regular occurrence is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere, so there is no perfect spot to land a spacecraft (like the Discovery One in ""The Explorers"").

Eureka Anomalies appear after an earthquake or disaster, and are usually caused by aliens. The amount of Eureka Anomalies is largely dependent on the size of the city (the bigger the city, the more Eureka Anomalies) and the number of anomalies appearing in that city. It is unknown what causes Eureka Anomalies to appear, but it is possible that something is causing them.

Eureka Anomalies Edit

Eureka Anomalies are a global phenomenon. They appear in cities around the world.

Eureka Anomaly Locations Edit

Eureka Anomalies can be found in the following locations:"

"A woman is in a critical condition after she was thrown 30 metres from a rooftop in New York's West Village this afternoon.

Police say that a woman got into an argument with her boyfriend at around 4.30pm at 24th street and 2nd Avenue in the West Village and tried to leave the building.

She then threw a purse into the street and was struck by a parked van at 30th street and 2nd Avenue.

A witness who saw the attack gave New York Police Department officers a description of the suspect.

The suspect was later identified as 33-year-old Nastassia Brousseau from Jamaica. She was taken into custody at the scene, and transported to hospital with life-threatening injuries.

There are reports that she is still in police custody."
"What is your favorite part about the new and improved PlayStation App?

One of the most enjoyable things we were hoping to deliver was the ability to easily view the game stats and playlists in real time, so that you can keep track of stats without having to remember a bunch of unique codes. For the longest time, this feature was not available in any other apps for PS4, and we're very excited to finally offer it to all PlayStation 4 players!

What has the feedback been like from our community on PS3?

We have been pleased at the response on PS3 to the new gameplay videos on PS App. So far, the overwhelming response has been very positive and we have heard a strong desire on the part of players to have the feature available in other apps. However there are some concerns around the way it's presented on PS App. We listened to those concerns and have made changes which should improve the view of statistics on PS App, and make it easier for players to discover.

What are some of the most important things players should know for the new features?

We will be changing the way that the stat sheets are presented on the PS App. On the PS App, you will be seeing two new buttons: Stats for PS App and Your Game Stats for PS App.

The stats section will become the first place to look at stats and their breakdown, which are now grouped into categories such as Kills, Deaths, Deaths per Minute, KDs, Assists and More. The your game stats area will provide a list of your most played content, the apps which you have used the most, the amount of times you played each game mode, any achievements you have, and even your user name.

These tabs should help make it easier for you to find out what's going on in your PS4 game experience without ever leaving your home screen by giving an overview, without having to hunt around for specific information."

According to the accident report, K.R. was driving in the right lane when he lost control of the car and collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction.

The victim was rushed to the Civil Hospital where he was declared brought dead.

The police have registered a case against the truck driver, the road contractor and the police constable for not giving a proper warning before the accident took place."
"The idea of a ""new American century"" is being debated and discussed more often in recent days than perhaps any other time in the past few years. The idea itself, as presented on one presidential campaign website, has been rejected by the White House. And it doesn't take a genius to see where this is going.

The question of how America's new century will look comes to mind when thinking about the United States' role in the world and who will ultimately decide what America will do. The American century has taken many shapes and forms, from the Pax Americana—America as unshakable power in the world—to today's much larger role on the world stage that involves more trade, more commerce and less empire.

In the past, however, the United States has always had its superpower moments and has had the power to determine how the world would look through the lens of its economic and military might, as was also the case in the past century. From 1910 to 1921, the United States dominated world affairs, from military and diplomatic expansion to development. That era ended with the Great Depression and World War II, with the U.S. superpower moment finally over.

But since World War II, the American century has been reduced to the more modest American century of trade and diplomacy, a period of economic growth and stability. Now, more than ever, the American century has to be about the values and principles of America, which is what President Donald Trump's administration wants to make it.

""This is not a time for us to be looking backwards on our great national history,"" Trump said during the campaign, ""but at a time when our country is faced with many challenges and great challenges for the future of world peace and prosperity."" But when the president, and he alone, defines American leadership in the 21st century, America's position will be much less defined than Trump envisions it being.

The American century was defined by the Monroe Doctrine and the Monroe Doctrine was defined by the presidency of Thomas Jefferson and the presidents of the Monroe and Jackson administrations. The United States was able to expand and shape the world because it was America's first truly great power.

""American greatness was a concept that was articulated by Thomas Jefferson, and [it] has been articulated over the past few centuries,"" President Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his 1908 book, ""Theodore Roosevelt and the New World.""

""For all time the American nation has been the indispensable nation, the strongest and most powerful nation in the world,"" continued Roosevelt. ""A nation which can rise to the challenges of the day, while preserving the values inherent in those days, is the power to be reckoned with. The United States will be the first to make this plain. The day of powerlessness and moral disgrace lies before us. The struggle is ours to win, and may be won. Only so.""

A century later, the United States continues to be that"
"Chances are your phone has a few apps, but they're probably not on this list. We've rounded up the best Google apps for Android that are worth downloading.

You can read our guide to adding new apps to your Android phone here.

Once you've browsed through the best apps for Android, you may find a few apps you don't know about. We've rounded up the best Google apps for Android that are worth downloading.

We're not saying this is the only Android app you'll ever need, but it's a good start. If you're looking for a few new Android apps that you might not have heard of, make sure you check out our list of the best Android apps for beginners.

Best Google Apps for Android:

1. Google Search

Google has a lot of search features built into its mobile OS, but one of the best is the ability to search Google.

The Google Search app is the official search app for Android, and it's a great way to make sure you're getting the best results when searching the web or the web at large.

You can search Google using all of the usual search operators, like exact meaning, partial meaning, and synonyms. Search results are presented in a pop-up window so you can see what you're looking for.

If you're looking for an app that provides a more professional search experience, it's important to note that you can search the web with other search engines, too.

It's not a really a great app when you're looking for something specific like a song or a URL, but if you're just looking for a few Google results, it's a great way to start.

2. Google Maps

Google Maps is the official mobile phone navigation app for Android, and it's got a ton of features to help you find your way around.

It's a great app to use in conjunction with Google Search, but with the right settings, you can manage your location and get directions along with your search.

Google Maps includes offline mapping capabilities, letting you find directions for you even if you don't have a data connection.

It's not a bad app to have, but it's definitely not the best. If you're looking for something more specialized, you may want to try one of the other navigation apps.

3. Google Talk

Google Talk is Google's instant messaging app for Android. There are no fancy features here, but it has a decent selection of IMs and group chats.

If you're looking for a free app that you can use to text with anyone, you're in luck. It's compatible with most messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype.

The app has a pretty minimal and simple interface, but if you're looking for a simple messaging app that doesn't require much effort to use,"
"I was recently asked a question by a colleague regarding gender. I've never actually thought about it myself, but it wasn't the usual question: Why can't I say ""boy"", ""girl"" or ""he"" on the phone?

I've never had a problem with gender before. I've always been a girl. The first time I heard about the word (it happened in the early 1990s) I was a very young and excited 16. I remember asking my best girlfriend at the time, ""Is it possible to call me'sir' or'ma'am'?"" She looked at me incredulously and thought to myself, ""What an odd thing to ask!"", but she soon realised her friend's mistake and had agreed with me.

She never tried to correct me, so this was a relatively uncontroversial change for me. But if it were her friend, she would have wanted to have my gender confirmed, and I'm sure I could have explained that I was indeed gender neutral and did not use gendered terms.

But I guess the question is really more one of semantics—why can't I say ""boy"" or ""girl"" on the phone? If I had to choose a gender marker, I'd probably use the letter ""m"", as I feel that ""boy"" should be used solely in contexts where girls are the only other option, and ""girl"" is generally reserved for the most gendered of situations.

Gender is a very personal area, as some women prefer to self-identify with a single gender while others have a more fluid identity. I identify as gender non-binary, which is an umbrella term for a variety of genders that don't necessarily fit neatly into male or female. I was raised in a fairly conservative country in South Africa, where my mother was very vocal about our strictness about gender roles.

If someone asked me if I'd like to marry a woman, I'd be very uncomfortable, as I find all forms of physical intimacy to be incredibly dangerous to one's health and emotional wellbeing.

In contrast, I know very few people who don't identify as gender queer, meaning that their gender may not be fully agreed upon, especially when it comes to clothing and behaviour. Because I'm very comfortable with gender non-conformity, I would probably say ""gay"" with a sense of sadness, or ""bi"" if a person wanted to be inclusive and not use gender.

I'd argue that the term ""male"", while extremely powerful, is a much harder one to get your head around. It implies that there are only two options, which isn't always true. So, I'd call myself gender neutral.

If you'd like to read more about gender, there are loads of resources on the internet, from books with fascinating stories to guides to feminism and trans awareness."

BOSTON (CBS) — Is football finally in the rear-view mirror?

The NFL has announced the schedule for the four-day 2014 Pro Bowl in Hawaii next month.

The game will air from Aloha Stadium on Jan. 31 at 8 p.m. ET.

With a schedule so packed, it's hard to make sense of the Pro Bowl's final lineup. But if you go through the rest of the Pro Bowl's 2014 offerings, you might find something to like.

Here are the Pro Bowl's 2014 regular-season matchups, which come in all eight divisions, with the top two teams from each division advancing into the Pro Bowl:

1. San Francisco 49ers (12-4)

2. Pittsburgh Steelers (12-4)

3. New York Giants (11-5)

4. Baltimore Ravens (12-4)

5. Washington Redskins (12-4)

6. Indianapolis Colts (13-3)

7. Green Bay Packers (11-5)

8. Chicago Bears (11-4)

In case you've ever wondered what this looks like if you were trying to figure out which two teams played the Super Bowl on February 6, don't worry. Just don't make the mistake I did.

The Pro Bowl will likely feature players such as running back Marshawn Lynch, outside linebacker Terrell Suggs, free safety Eric Berry, wide receiver DeSean Jackson, and tight end Vernon Davis.

""We'll start with a player who makes us proud,"" Pro Bowl Commissioner Roger Goodell said of Davis Monday at the combine. ""You don't want to be second, you don't want to play the guys in front of you, you want to look for that player that you feel will help us.""

Goodell pointed out that, unlike other parts of the schedule, these players are not playing in one of their final NFL regular-season games.

""We're going to have all of them back in Pro Bowl play,"" Goodell said. ""I'm so pleased that we got them all back to play in the Pro Bowl.""

The first Pro Bowl since 2007 will feature two matchups between two Super Bowl champions: New York Giants cornerback Prince Amukamara against Denver Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey, and 49ers tackle Joe Staley against St. Louis Rams tackle Jake Long.

""These are both great men, great friends,"" Amukamara said. ""They're both a tremendous part of this league and it's great to play with either one of my teammates.""

Staley said, with his teammates already set, he would get some good air time during pre-game.

""I have no doubt, I'll be in the middle of it,"" Staley said. ""It'll be nice to get in"
"In a case that could have national implications, a woman in Chicago is suing a local Uber driver who allegedly sexually assaulted her on the ride, leaving her with a black eye.

A woman in Chicago is suing a local Uber driver who allegedly sexually assaulted her on the ride, leaving her with a black eye.

In the lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court on Monday, the woman alleges that the driver, identified as ""John Doe"" in court documents, attacked her after she requested a ride on the Uber app.

According to the lawsuit, the woman, identified in court documents as ""Jane Doe,"" requested an Uber ride to visit her sister at the hospital.

John Doe allegedly picked up the woman from the Marriott Marquis Hotel, where she was staying, and took her to the Chicago Loop, where he dropped her off at her sister's hospital.

The lawsuit alleges that after dropping the woman off, John Doe and a friend drove her to a lakefront dock, where the woman alleges that John Doe sexually assaulted her.

The suit alleges that the driver then left the woman in a hurry, and she ""was left with a black eye and a swollen cheek.""

The woman's lawyer, Steven L. Sparks, told the Chicago Tribune that he will seek $500,000 in damages from the company, according to the Tribune.

""This is a particularly egregious case,"" Sparks told the newspaper. ""This is a very serious allegation, and the fact that it's only a complaint... is very, very troubling in itself.""

The company did not immediately respond Sunday to USA TODAY's request for comment.

Uber was hit with a string of sexual harassment allegations in January and February, including claims that a driver sexually assaulted a woman in India in 2014. The company has since fired dozens of its drivers and replaced them with part-time drivers.

In the latest allegations, Uber has said it is investigating the ""alleged incident.""

In a statement, Uber said it ""takes matters of this nature very seriously,"" adding the company is ""confident that Uber has implemented robust measures to protect our community and address any concerns.""

"The World Health Organization has recently declared a pandemic of influenza. It looks like global influenza pandemics will become a thing of the past. However, they can still bring death and suffering to mankind with their impact, with a pandemic occurring every ten minutes and with two million deaths a year.

This is not a hypothetical issue. It is occurring today and we need to think carefully about how we should respond.

The H1N1 pandemic was the world's biggest health crisis since the Spanish Flu in 1918. This pandemic killed somewhere between 2 – 3 million people. The flu virus itself isn't lethal – people are only infectious when they get a low-grade fever, cough or other signs of flu.

However it can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications - a pandemics can cause respiratory failure, heart problems and pneumonia. The symptoms often appear suddenly and include chills (like the flu) and a high fever (the flu).

It can also spread quickly around the world. Between 1918 – 1919 some 537,000 people died in World War 1. In the next two years, more than 50 million people died from the Spanish Flu.

In the 20th century another series of pandemics occurred, the first of which was H1N1 in 1918. The effects of these pandemics include the destruction of the entire world silk industry that would have had some $25 trillion in output from 2047 to 2075 – a loss of about 50% of world income (the value of trade with other countries).

With these losses, there was massive unemployment, particularly for agricultural workers. Many farmers took to the woods – many of them lost their farms.

By the beginning of the 21st century, with the pandemic of H1N1 still affecting everyone at some point, almost everyone over the age of 18 was considered susceptible.

The pandemic also spread rapidly; in 2001, in just the first year of transmission, more than 60 million people were infected and by the end of 1998, over 40 million people were infected.

At the peak of the epidemic in 2006, the death rate was somewhere between 40 and 50%. By 2008, there were less than 10 killed a year by the flu.

This latest outbreak of flu is different - the strain of virus is not as virulent as the H1N1 strains, and so deaths have been much lower - just under 10,000 so far.

So what's gone wrong?

I'm sure you know what a seasonal influenza is, and I'm sure you've heard of seasonal influenza vaccination.

The seasonal flu vaccine consists of a weakened or infected strain of the virus. The weakened virus is inactivated by heating to kill it, which is called inactivated influenza vaccine. A person is given this inactivated vaccine in their first three months of life.

"Basketball star Kobe Bryant is in the hospital for an undisclosed condition after a car accident on Saturday night.

According to TMZ, the former NBA star suffered a broken leg in the accident. He was reportedly hospitalized overnight and is still in a coma.

The accident happened around 8:20 p.m. on Saturday night at the intersection of Figueroa and Crenshaw boulevards. Bryant was in a sport utility vehicle, or SUV, with a female passenger when it turned into a travel lane, and was struck by a car traveling in the other direction. The female passenger suffered minor injuries.

The crash is being investigated by Los Angeles police. TMZ reports that Bryant was taken to a local hospital and treated for a broken leg and injuries to his ribs, buttocks and leg, which were not life-threatening.

The car Bryant was driving was a Chevrolet Tahoe, which has a Kia Soul model.

Bryant played for the Los Angeles Lakers from 1996-2007. He was the NBA's MVP in 2008 and 2009, and won two MVP awards."

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, as we continue our conversation with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges and his collaborator, David Barsamian. Hedges is an award-winning journalist who's written for The New York Times, The Guardian, Harper's, The Nation, The New York Review of Books, and he's written for The Nation about the U.S. war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's also written extensively on the U.S. government's role in the global economy and the corporate state. Hedges' latest book, Endgame: The World According to Dick Cheney.

Chris Hedges, welcome to Democracy Now! Chris, you have an incredible number of books. I know you like to say you don't do ""one book."" You have a number of books. Can you give us a number, how many books that you have written, and what they're about?

CHRIS HEDGES: Oh, I have about a dozen books, more than that. I guess, I was trying to say, I don't have a big book. I've written about that over the years. But I'll just give you one. It's called ""The Abuse of Power.""

AMY GOODMAN: ""The Abuse of Power.""

CHRIS HEDGES: Yeah, that's right. I wrote it in the '70s. I was just at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California, and I was talking to people about it in the garden and they just seemed so astonished, because it's so true. [Laughter] And I've been following it in the White House. I've been following it in the Pentagon. I've been following it in the Pentagon after 9/11. And it's just amazing to watch it play out.

And it's just—you know, it's like an interesting exercise. And I mean, it really is. It's like, who in Washington is really the—who is really running the show? It's so incredible to watch it. And so it's one more book I have written about the abuse of power. And it's about Cheney and Bush and Rumsfeld and the whole gang. And it's a very, very interesting—it's a very, very interesting book.

AMY GOODMAN: Do you feel it's changed your politics?

CHRIS HEDGES: Well, I think it's one of the most important books I've ever written. I mean, I think it's a very important book about why—about why the Bush administration became the way it became. It's a very important book, in large measure, to explain why the U.S. has become what it is. And I think it's very rare"

James N. Mattis, according to Pentagon officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing deal.

The contract, for four years, was made possible largely because of Mr. Panetta's promises to drum up support from lawmakers to give the Pentagon more time to complete the project, which was intended to expand the number of ships the Navy could launch from the oil-drilling arm, or ODS, in the Gulf of Mexico.

The $100 million contract, which was announced in November, was for a series of modifications under which the Pentagon would upgrade the ODS to launch more ships. The modifications also would allow the Navy to use a less expensive, longer-range, chemical-laced oil to start the ship.

The contract, but not the full amount, was approved in a Dec. 19 letter from Mr. Panetta to Mr. Mattis.

""This is a historic contract,"" said one of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive deal. ""It was a big deal because it was part of what the secretary wanted to do for the Navy, which is have a more robust oil-drilling capability in the future.""

The deal was announced on the same day that Mr. Mattis was named the new commander of the United States Central Command, which oversees the war in Afghanistan. It also was announced on the same day that Congress approved $1.35 billion in spending for the war in Afghanistan, which Mr. Obama had requested.

""The secretary is very focused on the war in Afghanistan and the importance of this strategic port in the Middle East,"" said the defense official. ""He believes we've got to make sure we have a rich shipyard in the Middle East"" to build the Navy's ships.

The $100 million contract was awarded on Dec. 19, two days after Mr. Panetta signed a presidential memorandum directing the Defense Department to award contracts for ""new and existing"" projects.

The memo did not specify what projects Mr. Panetta wanted to award. But the officials said the deal with Boeing was awarded because it was the largest single contract that had been approved"

The only known inhabitants of the island were the Seeker and her crew of scientists. The island was located south of the islands of the Pinnacle Point Sea. The island was located south of the islands of the Pinnacle Point Sea. The island had a series of caves and tunnels which were connected by several bridges.

The island has been featured in many novels and movie, but it is not known what happened to the inhabitants of the island prior to the Seeker's arrival. The only known inhabitants of the island were the Seeker and her crew of scientists.

The island was used as a testing ground for the Seeker's underwater vehicles. The island was covered by a mysterious compound which caused the Seeker's vehicles to malfunction. The complex also had a series of tunnels and caves which the Seeker and her crew of scientists used to explore the island and the surrounding water.

The Seeker and her crew of scientists explored the island and the surrounding water after discovering the Seeker's shipwreck. The Seeker discovered that the island was deserted and had nothing of import on the island. The Seeker returned to the mainland to discuss the findings with Captain O'Donnell, who was informed of the island's location by the Seeker. The Seeker and O'Donnell traveled to the island to investigate at first, but they were confronted by the Seeker's shipwreck, which the Seeker had destroyed before boarding the shipwreck.

The Seeker's crew of scientists caused the island to become flooded and caused the Seeker to crash land and be lost in the waters. The Seeker's crew of scientists caused the island to become flooded and caused the Seeker to crash land and be lost in the waters. The Seeker's crew of scientists became trapped, and the Seeker's shipwreck was discovered by the Seeker's crew.

"OAKLAND — Two Bay Area police officers were killed late Wednesday in a shooting in Oakland, and their suspected assailant was in custody late Thursday after a brief standoff with police in an Oakland home.

The suspected shooter, identified as Rhodesian immigrant Noor Salman, 31, was subdued by emergency responders and taken into custody shortly before midnight in the 900 block of San Pablo Avenue in the South of Market district, authorities said.

Police later confirmed that the suspect had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and that a second person had been taken into custody.

Noor Salman, 31, a member of the Oakland Police Department, killed two Oakland police officers and wounded a third on Wednesday night while they were serving a warrant in East Oakland, authorities said.

Salman was taken into custody after a brief standoff Thursday in an Oakland home, officials said. He had been wanted since the shooting.

The officers were killed late Wednesday at the intersection of 29th Street and International Boulevard after they responded to a shooting, authorities said. The officers were the first to be killed in the line of duty in Oakland since the 1980s.

The shooting was reported at about 9:25 p.m. Wednesday in the city's Fruitvale district.

The officers were responding to a report of a robbery, police said. When they entered the gangway, they encountered an armed man, who ""fired multiple rounds striking the officers,"" according to police.

The officers returned fire, and the man fled on foot — and police found a handgun with a bullet lodged in the chamber, police said.

Police Sgt. Ray Kelly said the men were both taken to the hospital in critical condition.

A third officer, who was not involved in the shooting, was grazed in the hand. He was treated at the scene.

A third officer, who has been on the force for about two years, was shot in the leg, and remains hospitalized.

The two officers were identified as Frank Pugh, 47, who has been with the department since 2009 and has been assigned to the West Area Patrol Division, and 28-year-old Brendan O'Brien, who joined the department in 2007 and has been assigned to the East Area Patrol Division.

Kelly said O'Brien's injury was not considered life threatening.

The wounded officer was in stable condition Thursday morning at a hospital.

The driver of the suspect's car fled the scene and remains at large, authorities said.

Salman was in the country illegally and has a criminal history, according to Alameda County court records. The only charge listed was a misdemeanor battery conviction in 2010.

Salman has written a letter of support to President Donald Trump and has attended several pro-Trump rallies in the Bay Area, USA TODAY reported.

Salman was taken into custody earlier this week after a tense standoff with police in"
"I've had this book for a while but have been putting it off, as I know the author did a fantastic job crafting a story that we all want to read. I have to say I wasn't disappointed, for all the love he poured into this book, he never did go overboard with too much. I also wish the title was different from what it is, a new story with the same themes, so it doesn't sound like a retread.


I am just going to leave this here:


""I could be anyone – if I had a heart like a sieve. A perfect girl in this book is not the one for me. But there is one, one who is so beautiful to look at that there is no one like her anywhere, or on Earth. There could be a thousand her, and each is like an island. Their island is a small, beautiful, and perfectly made one, and in it they were born.""


This is why I love reading, in stories filled with beautiful and perfect people, and what could be a beautiful and perfect story, but only a small part of who they were. He is so honest in his descriptions and his thoughts are like a song you like. He uses all the right words, and he doesn't use the wrong one to say anything either. There's also the beautiful music I don't want to spoil, so I'll just say this: this book is filled with life, and romance, and love, and humor, but also sad and sadder love, and it's just so very beautiful. There is an interesting line he brings up as a main character:

""There was no other life for a boy in his position, and no other death for anyone. The only way out for him was back to my door. But you are too young for death. You're too small to be killed. And no one will come to save you.""

He goes on to explain:


You won't know how to fight – it won't help you. You won't get any kind of respect from anyone. They won't even acknowledge you as people. The men you go to war with have a very different view of you. They don't like boys, and they don't like a woman who can't fight. Not in the same way, at least. They aren't your real father or sister. They are just men you don't like.""


I felt like a good piece of writing this as well, I can't tell you how many times I just sat back in my chair to think 'why? why am I still alive?'. Then I started reading again and realized that he doesn't make a choice that he can't live with. He had to go through a few more things, but the journey was worth it. He knows where he is going, what he wants, why he wants it, and he's so thankful to reach"

"Liam Picken scored 23 goals in all competitions last season

Liam Picken has left Rangers for Dundee, the Scottish Premiership club have confirmed.

The 29-year-old was brought in from Norwich City in January to replace Michael O'Halloran.

Picken added 10 goals to his total of 23 last term, which earned Rangers safety in the Championship.

Dundee have lost seven players during the summer but added seven more during the winter transfer window.

Saints director of football Leeann Dempster, who was involved in the Picken deal, said: ""Liam was a very popular signing for this club and we thank him for his contributions to the success we enjoyed over the course of last season.

""We would also like to thank Michael for his excellent service to this football club and wish him every success for the future.""

Picken's former team-mate Scott McDonald, now at Aberdeen, was recruited by Dundee as a goalkeeper and is on loan at the Tannadice club.

Rangers assistant manager Ian Cathro added: ""The club would like to thank Liam for his contribution to the club and his efforts over the last 12 months and wish him all the best for the foreseeable future."""
"I'll always be a sucker for a good movie poster, even if it was commissioned by a company with an agenda; it conveys the mood of the movie perfectly in an instant. The posters by Vassilios Giannakouris always had an interesting look but most of them would have only a little impact on me; they're either too busy or too minimal for me. I have seen many ""greats"" without ever being able to remember them; the posters are supposed to pull at your heartstrings and to inspire you to see the movie, but the fact remains that they just got me off the screen. Here's a list of 10 amazing movie posters of all time…

10. Jurassic Park by Dan O'Bannon

I think I was eight when I saw the blockbuster film Jurassic Park, and since I wasn't even allowed to go to the movies I was completely fascinated by this alien movie about reptiles coming to Earth. I remember it so clearly because on the cover of Jurassic Park was this picture of the two female protagonist, Claire and Ian, playing chess in the park; two of the best, if not the best, female characters in cinema history; I love any movie where a young female protagonist gets to be the hero in the first installment and I was so happy to see these two do so. I thought the movie had great scenes that made it a classic yet didn't have the kind of plotlines that often made movies great. The posters are iconic because of the fantastic artwork by Steve Duchamp, a style that most people will know but probably don't know what is that style all about. It's hard to describe an art style, even among classic artists like Van Gogh and Monet, but the same technique still applies today and can't be ignored – it's very minimalistic and yet it's still amazing because of what was seen in those posters.

9. Apocalypse Now by Steven Spielberg

This poster is so simple but incredibly effective – it communicates the message of war in a simple yet memorable way. The whole movie is about Vietnam, a war that was so difficult and costly and that ended with a horrific tragedy. The poster conveys the message of peace and the beauty of it, as well as the horrors of war and the devastation and war crimes committed by the US. The message of the poster is what makes it unique – the color scheme and the colors of the text. A movie like this was never going to become a classic poster because so much was said about it, but this poster is amazing because of the simplicity of it and what it shows a little more about the war.

8. Star Trek The Motion Picture by Herb Ritts

Here is this poster. It was supposed to be a surprise for the fans back in the day but still many of them don't ever notice it. It's really well done. They're really trying to make the movie look real,"
"Firstly, the issue is the availability of game content. The only way to get the expansions is to buy the DLC for the base game. This is a terrible way to run a business.

Secondly, there is no way to play the DLC without the base game, and that's completely fine.

Thirdly, there is no way to play the expansions without the base game, and that's completely fine.

So, the question is, is there any way to get the DLC if you don't have the base game?

I'm not a developer, and I don't know the answer to this question, but I'm a bit of a fan of Pathfinder, so I thought I'd try my hand at it.

First, the base game. The base game is $50, and if you're going to buy the game, you're going to need the base game. If you buy it, you're going to need the expansions too, and you're going to need to pick up the base game, expansions, and add-ons.

The problem is that you can't get the base game without the expansions, and you can't get the expansions without the base game.

So, there's really two ways to play this out.

Buy the base game. Buy the expansions, and play them.

Option 1: Buy the base game, and get the DLCs.

This is the most logical option. You're likely to get the DLCs for the base game and the base game alone.

Option 2: Buy the base game and get the DLCs, and play them.

This is the only way to get all of the DLCs, but it's quite a bit more work.

Option 3: Buy the base game and get the DLCs, and play them.

This is the best option. You're likely to get the DLCs for the base game, the base game alone, and the base game and DLCs together.

Now, I don't know exactly how much work playing all of the DLCs will be. I could pick the DLCs up one at a time, but that's a bit of a pain, and I don't think it would be very fun. I could also play them all at once, but that's a bit of a pain, and a bit of a mess.

So, the issue is that, if you pick option 3, you're going to need to buy the base game, the base game and DLCs.

Option 4: Buy the base game, and get the DLCs, and play them.

This is the least likely option. You're going to be getting the DLCs for the base game, the base game alone, and the base game and DLCs together.

The issue is that, if you pick option 4, you"
"""If you take the fact that these products have to be tested on an industrial scale,"" he says, in the video above, ""you start to understand why companies make a huge amount of money. Every time a car gets a new fuel-injection system made, it doesn't just use new parts for that one car. It uses new parts for other cars."" (You and I would never be able to afford a car that uses fuel injection, which is why most new cars use electric engines.)

What does this do to the industry, and to the people who work in it? ""There's a whole cottage industry of people who produce test-dried products that are perfectly safe and have a really high success rate,"" explains Dr. Jones. ""And even though they're not really tested, that doesn't mean they're safe. And it never comes up in safety inspections. And the people in charge of safety — there are more risks out there than just fuel-injection systems.""

Dr. Jones is a professor at the National Research Council, which advises the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency. He's also president of the Center for Auto Safety Advocates, which is the nonprofit group that filed the lawsuit against General Motors, in which Dr. Jones is also one of its co-executives."
"It's the end of an era! As the curtain reaches down on its fourth decade on air, the popular daytime talk show, The View, has decided it's going to be a bit different. Instead of looking to the past to find celebrities with unique points of view, the show will give viewers an opportunity to ""challenge"" each other through a series of four new episodes.

First up is co-host Jedediah Bila, who will go head-to-head against Dr. Mehmet Oz. The two have been sparring on other shows since Oz stepped into the show's cast of co-hosts in 2015. After seeing how much fun the two of them have had taking on each other in their fights, the network decided to give viewers more of a ""go-for-broke situation"" when the pair face off from Oct. 2 to 8.

The next contestants include Dr. Oz's longtime friend, Nancy Cartwright, who will go head-to-head with Tavi Gevinson. And finally, the third show will see former Talk TV Host Barbara Walters, a former co-host on The View, face off against new host Whoopi Goldberg.

""It is such an honor to welcome back two longtime co-hosts from The View and two fellow co-hosts from the previous generation to fight each other to see who is a bigger fan of the most popular personalities of the past,"" said Nancy Cartwright, who joined The View in 1999. ""But what makes this show different is that it doesn't rely on what one personality has to say on a given topic, it instead gives participants and viewers the opportunity to'suffer' together to see who will go on the offense with their argument as to which person is 'better.'""

Who is the biggest fan of Whoopi Goldberg?

""It's important to note that the show is a competition and that people have to submit content which makes them unique and make the viewers feel that the show reflects their view,"" explained Whoopi Goldberg. ""We must also make sure that a show which is supposed to be about being entertained is about more than just entertainment, it's about sharing opinions, learning about each other and being challenged.""

The fourth episode of The View, which airs Oct. 2 at 10 p.m. ET and 4 a.m. PT, is also the last opportunity viewers have to see who will be going on the offensive to show what they really think of each other. The final three competitors and the judges, Sherri Shepherd, Jedediah Bila and Whoopi Goldberg, will be revealed on Oct. 9 at 9 p.m. EST.

As to the other stars of the show, it's unclear just which past competitors will be paired up with which new hosts for the series. The most familiar face is Dr. Oz, who has been a staple on"
"I have recently found my way onto the internet, and I was shocked as soon as I realized I had stumbled onto a website called r/asktransgender and not onto YouTube. It was really something! I came across several videos that really hit home for me. One of them made me realize something. A lot of our genderqueer people who are out there are not actually genderqueer - they are just transitioning - a lot of these people just need to be educated a bit more. There was a question that really resonated with me: ""Why do you feel like you should be allowed to use the bathroom you are comfortable being in?"" This is a really great question - it brings up a lot of interesting points about gender and the ""social construction"" aspect it has. At its core it is a really important one. A transgender person is a transgender person. A person in the LGBT(Q) community is not a special gay in the way a trans person is special or a genderqueer person is special. Trans people are normal human beings like you and I and I have always felt the need to be in the open about my gender identity, but I have had moments where if we were to come out as being trans there would be social repercussions. As a result I have been on the front lines of supporting gay people to transition to become the person they always felt they were meant to be and a trans person to transition to become the person who they were always truly meant to be. It has been tough - some days I cry myself to sleep because of how much I have lost - a lot of trans people have the same issues, and when a trans person transitions and their livelihood is on the line they are more likely to give up due to that. A huge part of this is our gender identification and identity. It changes over time, with all trans people and even more so in the case of a trans person who has already transitioned and now wants to fully transition, for them being transgender becomes a matter of identity, not self identification.

So how does this issue apply to transgender people in schools? While there have been many studies on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, there are not too many studies on gender identity and sexuality. I have been on the front lines of pushing back and fighting to support young students to transition into their true gender identities - to be who and what they are meant to be. The only time I can think of in the last few years in which this has really come to the forefront was when the issue came around about trans students and bathrooms. A young boy who was really close to transitioning and had told his family all that was going to happen when he was outed publicly came home saying he felt like he couldn't go back into the girls room. I felt that was deeply heartbreaking, and as much as I am in support of a young person being able to transition as they choose, I couldn't let that young person in -"

"This past week, the U.S. economy added about 222,000 jobs — that sounds like nothing — and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent. These are good signs, as the current jobless rate is lower than the rate in the summer of 2011. But these figures are somewhat misleading because they're based on people dropping out of the labor force and getting fired. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people in the U.S. not in the labor force fell by nearly 7 million between 2007 and 2010, including some 47,000 who were in it during that period.

More than a quarter of the job losses during that recession came from people leaving the labor force to seek better-paying jobs. Of course, some may be fired when they lose their jobs and become ineligible for unemployment benefits -- and that can happen for anyone at any time.

The most recent and most dramatic example of this trend was the Great Recession, in which approximately 11 percent of employed Americans were fired or quit to find work after getting laid off. If you're laid off during the Great Recession, you can have a difficult time getting back into the labor force because you simply dropped out.

It's important to understand what constitutes a ""layoff"" when we think about this issue. If we focus exclusively on layoff statistics (as well as layoff rate statistics), then we risk missing out on very real improvements in joblessness over time in this country. Let's look at an example. Below is a picture of a family's monthly income chart, with the gray bars representing periods in which the family didn't make all of its money during a month or year:

The image that results is rather obvious if you know what to look for: In most years, the family wasn't living above water all of the time. But in the downturns before and during the Great Recession, the family was at the bottom of the income curve each month and sometimes on the brink of falling into the poverty line. The reason? The family made some money during the first few months of the recession due to job losses, but the rest of the year was a struggle. It had to scrape together some income to make ends meet, and then many months the family made very little.

Let's now apply this same graph to the percentage of people who are unemployed in the United States today. How do these jobless rates stack up against earlier periods in the past? The graph below shows the percentage of the population who were unemployed with three different unemployment rates throughout the post-World War II era, defined by the BEA as 8.1 percent during the recession of 1981-82, 6 percent during the 1982-83 recession, and 5 percent in the 1981-82 recovery. The red bars represent ""not in the labor force"" during those periods, and the blue bars represent those who were unemployed.

You'll notice that unemployment percentages went"
"We have the opportunity and the responsibility to have a conversation about what role technology can play in the health care process.

"Los Angeles, CA – The Los Angeles Kings announced today that the club has signed forward Mike Richards to a two-year, $13.5 million contract. Richards will be an unrestricted free agent on July 5, 2014. The deal is a two-way deal worth $4.25 million per season.

""We are very pleased to have Mike re-sign with the Kings,"" Kings General Manager Dean Lombardi said. ""He is a big body that can play both ends of the ice. He's a big body that can play in the middle of the ice. He has a great skill set and is very dangerous. He has a tough shot and is a great passer. We are looking forward to him being a part of the team for many years to come.""

Richards, 29 (9/25/81), appeared in 102 games with the Kings in 2013-14, scoring 20-33=44 points with a +15 rating and 22 penalty minutes, all career highs. He added 12-25=38 points with a +19 rating and 22 penalty minutes in 47 games with the Kings' American Hockey League affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs, in 2012-13.

A native of Thornhill, Ontario, Richards has also played for Vancouver, Calgary, Columbus, and Dallas during his career. He was originally selected by the Kings in the fourth round, 109th overall, at the 2005 NHL Draft.

The 6-foot-3, 215-pound forward joins the Kings after spending the past two seasons with the Calgary Flames. Last season, Richards appeared in 65 games for the Flames, setting career highs in goals (12), assists (14) and points (29). Richards set career highs in goals, assists, points and PIMs in 2011-12 with Calgary, where he scored 20-30=45 points with a +12 rating and 42 PIMs in 78 games. He also played in all 82 games for the Flames in 2010-11, notching 14-32=43 points with a +6 rating and 27 PIMs.

Prior to his time in Calgary, Richards spent two seasons with the Columbus Blue Jackets and appeared in 69 games with the club in 2008-09."
"The New Orleans Pelicans have told the league about their plans to file for relocation to Seattle, league sources told ESPN.

The Pelicans and Seattle are expected to make a formal request to the NBA on Thursday, but it's unclear if the NBA will approve or reject the request.

The decision to file for relocation was made by the Pelicans' ownership group, which includes Anthony Davis and his father, Chris, Pelicans owner Tom Benson, the New Orleans City Council and former NBA executive Alex Martins, sources said. The group will meet with the NBA on Thursday to discuss its plans.

The Pelicans have been under the league's microscope for several weeks, with the club's record of 19-30 and financial troubles -- including a potential move to Las Vegas -- prompting the NBA to investigate the club's financial state.

The NBA's investigation of the Pelicans' finances will continue, sources said, and that investigation will be partially funded by the city of New Orleans. The NBA has been working with the New Orleans City Council and the Pelicans to explore options for the team to remain in New Orleans, sources said.

The Pelicans have been without a team since the departure of the Sacramento Kings in 2011.

The Pelicans have spent most of the past season in the NBA Development League, and in early January, their season was ended by the D-League.

The Pelicans have a working agreement with the Seattle Storm to play in the WNBA's Seattle Storm during the 2015-16 season.

— The Lonely Girl and the Handsome Robot This is the lonely girl and the lonely robot, the lonely robot and the lonely girl, the lonely robot and the lonely girl, the lonely robot and the lonely girl. And the lonely girl and the lonely robot. And the lone lonely robot.

There are a lot of girls out there who love to screw, rob and be taken advantage of.

There are a lot of guys out there who think that just about anyone can do that. So why not have a couple of them together?

The female character is a straightforward, bad-girl, slutty, independent, sexual, hyper-sexual, or simply all of the above. She's straight-up self-centered, and probably a mind-reader. Her fetish is to have a dominant role in sexual interactions. She is usually a member of a Love Triangle, or happens to be the Love Interest to the protagonist.

The male character is a somewhat less-straightforward, but still bad-boy type. He has a dominant personality, but his hyper-sexuality is a way of showing his ""weakness"" in comparison to the other character. (And usually his mother is the one who is doing the hyper-sexuality.) He may have a crush on the other character, or be the Love Interest to the protagonist.

The female character is usually the more aggressive partner, or the one who dominates the interactions. The male character is the more passive partner, and the one who is the center of attraction. The relationship is typically a Love Triangle, and is often a Love Triangle Romance.

This trope is generally Played for Laughs, but there's no need to laugh. You really don't want to get this girl pregnant, because sometimes, the sexy robots are the only ones who can live. If the female character is a robot (or an android), then she's this. If all the characters are also robots, then they're The Robot Couple. Both of these tropes can be played for drama or comedy. A more serious version of this trope is a Sister Trope.

"Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Murat was the first Turkish leader to visit Syria in August

Turkey's president has said his country's role in Syria will be limited to ""humanitarian"" aid.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would only take part in any future ""political solution"" to the country's civil war.

He said Turkey would not send forces to Syria as part of a coalition to fight Islamic State (IS).

Turkey is one of the main backers of the Syrian opposition.

Speaking at a ceremony at Turkey's main airport in Ankara, Mr Erdogan said: ""We will not be joining any coalition to fight terrorism. Our role in Syria will be a humanitarian one.""

He said Turkey's armed forces would ""act in coordination"" with the Syrian opposition, but would not be involved in combat operations.

Turkey's parliament has approved military action in Syria against IS but Mr Erdogan has insisted it need not be a ground force, as originally planned.

IS has been pushing to seize territory in Syria and Iraq, where it has established a self-declared caliphate.

The group has been blamed for a series of attacks in Turkey, including a suicide bombing in the capital Ankara in October, which left 44 dead.

The group also carried out attacks on Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq in October.

Turkish officials have said that if it was necessary, Turkey could send ground troops to Syria to aid the fight against IS.

The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US and EU, is fighting for greater autonomy in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.

IS militants have stepped up their attacks in the past few weeks amid the Turkish military operation in northern Syria.

The militant group has also carried out attacks in the western city of Paris and in the capital, Ankara.

On Friday, French President Francois Hollande said that IS had carried out a ""terrorist attack"" on Paris, but has not identified any of the attackers.

The president also said that some of the attackers who carried out the November 13 attacks in Paris had entered Europe through Greece."

After eight months of investigation, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) has charged former Swiss police chief Klaus Bouillon with ""conspiracy to commit serious crime"". (Keystone)

A former Swiss police chief was charged with ""conspiracy to commit a crime against the state"" today after eight months of investigation, which began after a former officer, who was a member of the public at the time, published details about an affair with a colleague in 2003.

In the wake of the affair at the centre of the case last September, some 10 women filed complaints with the criminal authorities accusing Bouillon of sexual harassment. He had previously rejected all the allegations but on July 5 he was charged with a crime relating to the sexual contact with a colleague between March 2002 and August 2003, the BfV said. He could face up to five years imprisonment if convicted.

The alleged victim was not named due to her non-disclosure agreement. However, according to the BfV, Bouillon was a member of the public at the time of the sexual affair.

The inquiry began last November, with the then head of the federal prosecutor's office, Christiane Landau, deciding to proceed after three weeks of inquiry following an inquiry into a report in the newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, which had accused former deputy police chief Rolf Sattler of sexually assaulting his girlfriend.

According to the BfV's report, Bouillon was part of a team at the federal prosecutor's office monitoring a probe into a case that started in 1995 when a former top police officer, Jurgen Thaler, was arrested and charged with abusing his authority as the head of the Geneva branch of the police in relation to a corruption case.

Thaler allegedly received a total of €4.5 million as a bribe from a suspect he had jailed for a fraudulent bank loan and he went to jail for two years, before he was released. He subsequently resigned from the civil service. Thaler was arrested again in 2004 in connection with more charges and this time served a maximum of five years in jail.

The investigation into the Thaler case was closed with no punishment.

The BfV report suggested that Thaler might have been ""a victim of a conflict of interest of which Bouillon was a part.""

The BfV report also suggested that another investigation into other criminal complaints about Bouillon was closed without punishment after the allegations were made by a member of the public.

The BfV has been investigating Bouillon since he was appointed head of federal prosecutor's office in 2012. In May last year, the director of the BfV, Hansjoerg Rittgers, opened an inquiry into Bouillon and decided to follow up through Bouillon's former employer"
"""We are not a nation of cowards,"" the president said in the speech. ""We will not be intimidated.""

His statement came after a week of rising tensions with North Korea, including the swift reopening of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint industrial park that employed 15,000 North Koreans.

When he walked into the presidential Blue House on Friday, Mr. Trump was greeted by a group of North Korean soldiers, dressed in military uniforms and carrying guns. The soldiers exchanged words with Mr. Trump as he walked into the residence, and the two men had a brief conversation before the visit was over.

Mr. Trump has been pressing China to take a harsher line on North Korea, and he told reporters traveling with him that the United States would ""do it anyway"" if China fails to act. The president has said he would use ""whatever power this office holds"" to prevent North Korea from developing its nuclear weapons and missiles."
"The United States is sending an additional 600 troops to Saudi Arabia to provide assistance to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, as the conflict continues to escalate.

The US military has yet to determine the exact number of new troops, and Pentagon officials have yet to say whether they will be working directly with Saudi Arabia in the region, or whether they are providing logistical support, including air support, to the Saudi-led coalition. If the latter is the case, some Pentagon officials are concerned that the increase in forces could end up increasing the risk to American service members in the region.

Last month, Defense Secretary James Mattis called for more US troops to train Iraqi forces in their fight against ISIS, though he did not specify their exact goals. The Pentagon has indicated that it is not concerned about civilian casualties that could be caused by the training given the tight security in the country.

""We're not worried,"" Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said in October. ""We know our aircrews were in place. This training operation was well-coordinated to the best of our knowledge with all interested parties.""

The coalition fighting in Yemen has been working with US air, ground and naval forces to push back Houthi forces who have seized large parts of the country's southern provinces and in late January seized a military base, prompting the US to send special operations forces to help Saudi Arabia.

The deployment to the region coincided with the beginning of the ceasefire between the Houthis and the Iranian-backed Yemeni government, with Saudi Arabia having announced in mid-November that it was ready to resume military operations. The US-Saudi cooperation and involvement in the conflict could, among other things, have affected the timeline for the lifting of airstrikes by the US-led coalition and possibly influenced the way the conflict is played in the American media.

The deployment of additional US troops to the region may have been influenced by the fact that the United Nations' humanitarian adviser to Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, told The New York Times on Tuesday that it is ""virtually impossible"" for the Saudis to be completely satisfied with the UN's delivery of aid to the Yemeni people. The UN said in October that, according to UN estimates, at least 4,300 people had been killed in the conflict, with an unknown number being killed by the Saudi coalition airstrikes that the military and media have blamed for the deaths.

The United Nations said on Wednesday that its aid coordination for Yemen is on track following the agreement to resume aid deliveries.

Trump's defense secretary Mattis has said that the US is ""looking closely"" at its strategy in Saudi Arabia."
"If you've never heard of TMS, or you're unsure if it's right for you, the following is a brief guide to understanding the service.

What is TMS?

TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulator) is a very highly-advanced and sophisticated brain stimulation device. It stimulates the brain in a non-invasive and non-invasive way, using a magnetic field.

The research behind it is very detailed, and it's the only treatment that uses a magnetic field to stimulate the brain. Other brain stimulators use a magnetic field as a form of stimulation, but they don't use it to stimulate the brain. If you consider that they are about the same as using a stimulator on your skin, that is.

TMS is also the only treatment that uses an electrode to stimulate the brain. The other brain stimulator treatments use electrodes to stimulate the skin. This is a form of stimulation that can be very uncomfortable, and it's not very effective.

The other thing that TMS does is it stimulates the brain to improve your mood and memory. Basically, it's a form of therapy that's designed to improve your health and mental well-being.

Is TMS right for me?

TMS is very different from other treatments. It only affects the brain, and it doesn't make you feel happier or more healthy.

If you're considering TMS, you should be aware of the following:

TMS is not for everyone. It's very invasive, and it's not suitable for everyone.

There will be some side effects, but they're generally mild and temporary.

TMS is not in any way harmful to your health.

So, if you're considering TMS or have tried it in the past, you should know that it's not right for everyone. It's not for everyone, and it's not for everyone that you have tried it before.

However, if you've tried it, and it's working for you, you should consider it.

How long does TMS last?

TMS is effective, and it can be effective for a very long time.

One of the greatest benefits about TMS is that it doesn't require any therapy to be effective. You simply add it to your treatment regimen.

The long-term benefits of using TMS are incredible. You can improve your mood and memory for decades, and you can do this for a low cost.

TMS is extremely effective, and it's an incredibly cheap treatment option.

TMS can improve memory and mood for decades, and it can be cost effective.

If you have TMS, you'll probably have it for many years.

Can I use TMS if I'm pregnant or nursing?

While TMS can be used to improve mood and"
"The Post's Karen Tumulty explains what the ruling means for the future of the Affordable Care Act. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)

The Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Obama administration has the power to make people pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service for failing to buy health insurance, a ruling that could have far-reaching implications for the health-care law.

The court ruled 5-to-4 in favor of the IRS in a case brought by Tony Mazzocchi, a businessman who runs a construction company in New Jersey. Using a provision of the Affordable Care Act, Mazzocchi was charged with a penalty for failing to purchase health insurance after he started working for a firm that provided workers health insurance.

[Supreme Court strikes down key provision of health-care law]

Mazzocchi, who has registered as a conscientious objector, opposed providing health insurance because he has a heart condition. He filed suit against the IRS in 2013, arguing that the Affordable Care Act was an unconstitutional infringement on his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

""The Affordable Care Act, by its text, text alone, is not neutral,"" Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said in the majority opinion.

The case was brought by Mazzocchi and other objectors, who argued that the requirement that individuals purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty was a violation of their religious beliefs. The case was brought in 2013 by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a conservative Christian law firm, and by the American Civil Liberties Union.

[Supreme Court strikes down key provision of health-care law]

The case was closely watched by the Obama administration. The administration had argued that the tax penalty for not having insurance was designed to encourage people to buy coverage, not punish them for their religious beliefs. A federal appeals court ruled in 2013 that the health-care law could not force people to buy coverage, and upheld the penalty as a tax.

The case was resoundingly lost by the Obama administration, and the Supreme Court agreed Monday to take it up again.

""The government has the power to make the health-care law work,"" Alito said in the majority opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. ""It cannot, however, force anyone to engage in conduct that violates his religious beliefs.""

Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, writing that the government has a right to impose the penalty on people who do not purchase insurance because it will ""reduce the number of uninsured by encouraging them to purchase insurance.""

"Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) said Tuesday that his wife, Jenny, has taken a ""decisive step"" in their divorce, and his advisers are seeking a divorce settlement of $10 million.

Sanford's bombshell statement came one day after Jenny Sanford, the former host of an MSNBC talk show, said she wanted a divorce.

""Jenny and I have been in discussion about the possibility of divorce for some time as I have grown increasingly worried about the deterioration in our marriage,"" Sanford said. ""Our goal has always been to maintain our family's privacy and avoid the distraction of public speculation.""

The statement indicated Sanford is seeking a divorce, though he did not say so.

Sanford's statement has left many unanswered questions.

"A significant number of young people are not willing to invest in expensive mortgages, a survey has found.

In the 2017 ""Youth Housing Affordability Survey"" (YHA) survey, 26% of 18-24 year olds said they would not be willing to take out a mortgage if they were offered the chance.

The survey, which was conducted by the UK's Housing and Planning Association, also found that social housing is unaffordable for many young people, with 61% of 18-24 year olds saying their rent or property costs are a major problem.

The survey also found that 54% of young people would like to own their own home, but said they were not confident of finding a suitable home.

Crisis in housing

The YHA survey comes as ministers have admitted the Government's housing policy is failing to tackle the housing crisis.

Prime Minster Theresa May has been criticised for her failure to address the housing crisis, which has seen private rents in London soar to over £2,000 a month, while the average rent in the capital has risen by nearly 40% in the last decade.

Meanwhile, the number of young people living in social housing has fallen by more than 6,000 in the last decade.

Theresa May has blamed the housing crisis on ""failing"" councils.

The YHA survey also found that more than a third (36%) of 18-24 year olds said they were not confident they could get a job if they wanted to buy a property in the near future.

The survey also found that 18-24 year olds were less likely to have a job than any other age group.

AMY GOODMAN: We're going to turn now to the most recent report by the U.S. intelligence community on Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election. The report concludes the Russian intelligence services sought to interfere in the U.S. election specifically—actually, all the way in—by stealing information from the Democratic party and its operatives. The report's author, the CIA's top civilian analyst, says the U.S. intelligence community was unable to determine whether the Russian hackers were acting on the orders of President Vladimir Putin or on their own. The report also concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an active effort to deceive the public and the U.S. about the state of the Russian economy.

The report does not name Russia outright, but it cites Russian government officials and business figures as being behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee, the release of stolen emails by WikiLeaks and the dissemination of stolen emails via social media such as Facebook and Twitter. The report was completed in August and released this past Friday.

Well, for more, we're joined here in Washington, D.C., by John Schindler, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, where he's a retired U.S. Army infantry officer and national security official with 20 years of experience. He's been a former Army infantry officer serving in Germany, Korea, Vietnam and Egypt.

In this latest article, he writes, quote, ""A former CIA operative and his fellow security experts were right. It was the Russians. The CIA and the FBI had a long running investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign but were stopped in their tracks by a single rogue CIA and FBI agent named James Comey. So far, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, has been unable to correct the record. They and others have yet to explain the 'hacking' that Comey and others are still unwilling to name as an actual intelligence matter but which the CIA and FBI knew was a Russian operation.

""And they have made their names by being as tight with Obama as they possibly could and the Democratic Party establishment. It is now clear that despite being the most powerful nation in the world, they have no idea how many times Obama has been deceived and deceived.""

We welcome you back to Democracy Now!, John Schindler. How does this differ from the report by the intelligence community that was released back in January?

JOHN SCHINDLER: It's a different report. They're not going to be allowed to publicly release it for a few weeks, to keep the Russians happy, to keep it from WikiLeaks and the public to keep it from the Democrats, but I will give you the first couple of things that I think are worth mentioning. The most significant change to the report is that the intelligence community admits in the second annex that they still don't know the truth. They"
"The following article was first published on the Water Resources Development Corporation.

The world's greatest water resources are concentrated in the Nile River basin. This region is home to 20% of the world's surface freshwater, and provides around 20% of the world's freshwater from rainfall.

The Nile River is the world's largest river-based waterway. The three largest river-based waterways in the world are the Nile, the Amazon, and the Aral.

The Nile River Valley is the largest lowland agricultural and urban economy in Africa. It is the source of one third of the Nile's total water flow, and the main water source for water treatment and irrigation. The Nile River runs from the Red Sea in the south to the Delta in the north.

The region's population is estimated at over 70 million. In 2010, the Nile Delta produced $90 billion in exports and $340 billion in imports.

In terms of water resources, the Nile River basin is the world's largest and the most diverse in terms of its size and variability.

About 40% of the Nile River basin's surface vegetation is on the dry Nile River delta.

About 60% of the surface water in the Nile River basin is found in the delta. About 85% of the Nile River's total irrigated area is in the Delta.

The Delta is the world's second largest urban area, with a population of approximately 70 million.

The Delta's population density is higher than any other urban area in the world.

The importance of the Nile River

The Nile's importance can be seen in the fact that it is the only river in the world that can provide water for more than one billion people – around 20% of the world's population.

"The U.S. and South Korea are both preparing for a test of the Hyunmoo-3 missile that North Korea reportedly is planning to launch, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, citing an unnamed official from South Korea's Defence Ministry.

Interested in North Korea? Add North Korea as an interest to stay up to date on the latest North Korea news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The report, based off the assessment of another official who attended the meeting among officials from South Korea, the U.S. and Japan in Japan earlier this week, comes even as South Korea also announced it would launch a satellite into orbit by 2020.

In the meeting with Japan, the U.S. and South Korea, it was found it was ""in both of the countries' interest"" to conduct the Hwasong-10 test, Yonhap reported.

The Hwasong-10 is North Korea's latest mobile missile launch vehicle. The Hwasong-10 is a more capable version of North Korea's Musudan or Long-Range Rocket System and the most recent missile to have appeared on North Korean television.

On the day of the meeting in Japan, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said North Korea ""has already declared its intention to start its ballistic missile testing and has already put out a plan to carry out the Hwasong-10.""

The first known missile North Korea conducted on TV was the mid-range Taepodong-2 in June 2016. Since then, Pyongyang has launched several mobile missiles that include the KN-08 and Musudan, two versions of intercontinental missiles.

The Yonhap report comes after a ballistic missile test by North Korea on July 4 that experts said showed that it had improved its reliability and range, the highest ever since the launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile in July 2016.

""These tests have shown North Korea can reliably perform a launch every two weeks and at a higher level of precision and reliability than prior to July,"" said Paul Brannen, an expert in missile defense based at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, in an email to ABC News on Monday.

The missiles used in the latest launch, Brannen said, are longer range than the ones North Korea launched in June.

""This is also in accordance with recent North Korean rhetoric indicating increased willingness to move from demonstrating capability to actual delivery capability, thus increasing the chances that such launches are successful,"" he said.

The U.S. has been pushing for the South Korean government to increase efforts to get a satellite into orbit by 2020. In addition to the Hwasong-10 launch, South Korea plans to use the launch of the Kwangmyongsong-2 satellite to send the country's first Earth observation satellite into space.

"Image copyright AP Image caption In July 2017, President Trump called Kim ""Rocket Man"" in response to the North's missile launch

President Donald Trump wants to ""maximise pressure"" on North Korea and believes his recent missile strike was a ""strong message"" to the Kim Jong-un regime.

The attack on a Syrian airbase was the first time the US had struck forces in Syria since President Barack Obama was in office, but his administration is widely criticised for not pursuing similar action in Syria.

Mr Trump told Reuters news agency he had given his permission for his strike.

The strike led to the deaths of nine civilians.

The Syrian government has rejected the US claims that the weapons hit their aircraft. The US called it the ""direct result of Assad's murderous assault"".

On the ""Rocket Man"" comment, Mr Trump said: ""I don't want people to say, 'Oh, he mentioned Donald Trump by name.' And I don't care what it does to the relations - I care what it does to Syria and the Syrians.""

Mr Trump's move was in response to last week's missile attack, which drew criticism from China and Russia, which also support Syria as part of a US-led coalition in the region.

How the strike came about

On 7 April, the US launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the USS Porter, in the Mediterranean Sea. The attack targeted aircraft, warehouses and personnel, destroying 22 airframes, 18 tanks, 10 armoured personnel carriers, 10 pieces of military infrastructure, and destroying a water purification system, according to Pentagon.

The US has not publicly stated how it came to carry out the strike, though US officials said they were informed on the same day of the planned air strike.

However, the US has been hesitant to act militarily against North Korea, which conducted four nuclear tests in 2016 and is believed to be close to developing an inter-continental ballistic missile able to reach the US mainland.

Mr Trump warned on Monday of ""very serious consequences"" for its attack on Syria.

On Tuesday, after talks with the leaders of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, President Trump said the US was prepared to impose ""very stiff"" financial sanctions on Russia and other countries that support the Syrian government.

"TEMPE, Ariz. -- With Dan Uggla (strained hammy) and Todd Helton (strained right hamstring) both done for the year, Arizona Cardinals coach Bruce Arians is looking for a trade to bolster an offense that is averaging only 16.3 points per game.

But if a trade of Uggla works out for the Cardinals, it's unlikely to be at the expense of a second-round pick, which is what they would get if they traded him to the San Diego Padres, according to a major-league source.

The Cardinals are viewed as a seller on Uggla and have already done their due diligence on the right fielder. The team has been at the center of trade rumors involving Uggla this spring and tried to address the situation again this week, when they met with the struggling outfielder, according to a source.

Reds general manager Walt Jocketty has been linked to Uggla earlier this week in trade rumors.

Uggla has two years and $28 million remaining on his contract. He has spent the past two seasons in Cincinnati, where he has played in just 80 games because of injuries.

Uggla has struggled at the plate this season, batting.226 with a.714 OPS and 15 strikeouts in 66 plate appearances.

In a statement released by the Cardinals, the team said they are ""focused on our young players, like first baseman/left fielder Matt Holliday, who have a bright future. We'll have the opportunity to evaluate other players this offseason, including Uggla, and continue to evaluate the impact they will have on our club.""

Holliday, who is a free agent after the season, said he doesn't know what to expect from the team, and he's not sure if he'll be back next season.

""I don't know what's going on with the Cardinals,"" Holliday said. ""I thought they were going to do well this year. I think they're going to do well next year. They are a good team. I'm not sure what they're doing right now.""

Holliday has been a steady part of the Cardinals' lineup, batting.269 with a.711 OPS in 124 games this season.

The team's top three hitters this season, Holliday, third baseman Kolten Wong and shortstop Jhonny Peralta, are all under team control for three more seasons.

Uggla would be an upgrade on Holliday as a player and as a clubhouse leader. But the timing of the Cardinals' interest in Uggla could be more about the timing of the team's interest in Holliday.

The Cardinals are not expected to make any major changes to the organization this offseason, but they have been linked to several players, including Uggla.

"In the latest news about the world and the US, The New York Times reports that U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials will receive a report on North Korea when the U.N. General Assembly wraps up on Tuesday. The report will probably contain the same information that the Times has already reported — that North Korea's leaders would like to see the United States removed from its sanctions list, and wants to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump.

The report from the United States Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research also likely will point to the regime's continuing efforts to develop nuclear-tipped missiles.

North Korea's efforts will likely be discussed during separate closed-door meetings that foreign diplomats are taking part in as U.S. diplomats are also conducting diplomatic outreach to China on this and other topics, the Times reports. One of the attendees at these meetings reportedly is Vice President Mike Pence.

The Times, citing a senior U.S. official, noted that Washington was aware of news of a possible report, but that U.S. agencies had not made a decision on the issue yet.

Washington is expected to announce another round of tough new sanctions against North Korea by the end of the week, The Washington Post reported Friday.

Trump has previously said he would consider a military strike against Pyongyang if Pyongyang carries out an attack on the United States and said he would be willing to meet Kim Jong Un.

Trump also promised a ""major, major conflict"" on the Korean peninsula with the latter's ""outright refusal"" to discuss the issue with him, if he made good on his recent threats.

Last week, Trump warned North Korea that ""something will happen"" if Kim Jong Un's regime threatened the United States because Kim ""just stated that they are not going to take anything off the table, including, yeah, your big missile launches."""
"I don't want to see me fall

Just like the day I met you

I've been around for a while now, I've known you long.

You're the kind of person that

Even though you have so many friends,

You still choose me.

I love you, so don't change a thing,

If you're happy, we'll come again

The day when,

Even though its cold, I'll take you for a walk.

You're the kind of person that

Even though you have so many friends

I choose you.

(I love you, so don't change a thing)

Just when we thought we had nothing left to lose,

I finally got the chance to say goodbye

To the person I've loved since I was born.

(You're the kind of person that

Even though you have so many friends,

You still choose me)

So, I choose you

Because what you've done for me

Is even greater than what I could do for you.

(We'll come back again, just say yes

When I say, I love you

I'll be the one who makes you smile)

Just for one day I'll do all that I can to take me to where you're going

Even if it's only by a little

Don't make it difficult

Just let me say,

I love you

""Why did I get this tattoo?""

""I thought it was obvious that

You had some sort of crush on me.""

Or

""I knew you really liked me since the first moment I saw you.""

""I love you so much I could die for you.""

These are just some of my favorite things that people have said to me.

It would be great if people couldn't say these things if I was just a normal person, but the tattoo says otherwise.

You probably can't read this,

But I'll let it speak for itself.

Because if you know what my body says,

It's telling you,

That I really mean it.

* * *

Hey, I haven't forgotten you!

I'm on my way back to

The place I love

You were always by my side

And I could never ask for anything better.

I'm going to be with a guy who

Is even more fun to be with than you.

The night we went on a date

Is the best time of my life.

So go ahead and keep on living

Like we did all those years ago.

Now we can be in all the crazy places

"The European Commission is considering new laws that could punish media coverage of mass migration as an offence and the possible criminalisation of protests.

European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said in an interview with EURACTIV UK on 9 August that he would welcome new legislation to ""protect freedom of expression"".

""I can accept the question of the press. But the press should, I believe, contribute from the point of view of freedom of expression,"" he said. He did not explain what he meant by freedom of expression.

""A lot the discussion is about asylum seekers.""

But the vice-president also admitted that the discussion of the press during crises ""somewhat needs to be rethought. It needs to be better debated.""

It's one thing to discuss laws against reporting of terrorist atrocities or for publishing photographs of child abuse. But what about criticism of mass migration, which some argue is a security threat?

The law that could change a lot of peoples' views on media reporting is a 'propaganda' law drafted by Polish MEP Janusz Korwin-Mikke and submitted to the Council of Ministers on 12 August.

The EU commissioner and vice-president of the European Commission, says that the proposed law could target ""publications"" that ""misrepresented"" or ""infiltrated"" mass migration.

This would include online media, online radio and television and in print.

""If you want to prevent propaganda, you have got to make sure we do not give propaganda rights to people who are interested only in promoting the movement of people, not in respecting the rule of law and not in respecting people's legal rights.""

This is a reference to Poland's Law on Propaganda of National, Racial and Religious Hatred, which was introduced under then justice minister Ewa Kopacz and has already been used against public figures who have criticized the policy.

In Poland, the law would cover online media and radio and TV broadcasts.

The EU commissioner would not elaborate on the potential effects of the Law on Propaganda, which is to come into force in 2017. The Polish parliament first approved the bill in August, but it was not put in force until it was amended to include a clause allowing it to be used ""against mass migration"".

The Polish government's intention to use the legal provision to target journalists, and critics of the government, was underlined last month when it filed a legal challenge against a media report that described the mass detention of a large number of migrants at a temporary camp in Czestochowa.

The Polish government has launched a legal action against a Polish media outlet that published a graphic story on mass detention at the migrant camp known as Velenje. The report, published on 4 August, included a video documenting the camp, which the government said was run by the far-right, the Polish newspaper Wpro"

"President Trump is being accused of fueling racism with his support for the Confederate flag.

The Confederate flag has been presented as a symbol of racism for decades, but the recent controversy over its removal has brought the issue back into the spotlight.

Mr. Trump has expressed support for the Confederate flag in the past, and his administration has already tried to undo the recent Confederate flag changes by removing the words ""Confederate States of America"" from its official website.

But the president has been accused of being part of the problem by his supporters and opponents.

""I am a southerner with heritage from every part of the South,"" wrote one user on the Twitter account for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""I have no intention of honoring the flag of the Confederacy. Why should I? The flag is an offensive symbol of slavery, racism, and hate. I am not proud to be a southerner of any stripe. I will never fly the flag again. It has no place in our society.""

Others have taken to social media to say that Mr. Trump is using ""reverse racism"" to attack minorities.

Take a look:

For the record, Trump supporters are not racist. They are just upset that they aren't the ones being called out for supporting the Confederate flag. https://t.co/fU2z9sGxgC — Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) August 17, 2017

I'D rather read about the KKK using the Confederate flag than about the KKK using the #TrumpFlag. https://t.co/lwjLW22GCS — PeterBeinart (@PeterBeinart) August 17, 2017

The Confederate flag has a complicated history, and in many ways a complicated history of its own. It is often presented as a symbol of slavery and racism, but it was also used as a sign of rebellion and defiance against the United States during the Civil War.

The flag is still flown to this day in several southern states, and it is a common sight at sporting events in the South and in other parts of the country.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has estimated that there are about 1.5 million white supremacists in the U.S.

The issue is not new, however. A number of studies have shown that the flag is not only not an appropriate symbol for Southern states, but that it is often used as a symbol of racism and oppression.

Mr. Trump has long been a proponent of the Confederate flag, which he often refers to as ""heritage.""

""We're taking down statues of George Washington, and we're putting up statues of Robert E. Lee,"" Mr. Trump said in a CNN interview last year. ""I notice they're coming down. And I notice that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next"

"Saskatoon police are now offering a $1,500 reward for the capture of a man who allegedly posed for a series of sexually explicit photographs of children, mostly boys with their faces superimposed in black and white.

Investigators allege the suspect, identified as 39-year-old Justin Christopher Hill, of the 1200 block of 3rd Avenue S., is responsible for taking approximately 30 photos of children from 2009 through 2014.

In those photos, the children are seen in various positions; one of the photos shows multiple people standing around an adult female in the act of engaging in sexual acts with a boy.

One of the men allegedly taking the photos is Justin Christopher Hill. (Submitted to Saskatoon Police Service) Police say photos surfaced after a man went to police at the end of July, alleging that he had been photographed inappropriately by Hill while he was a school bus driver and a volunteer at a Saskatoon Catholic elementary school.

Hill then allegedly called the school to let it know he was the subject of a police investigation. When police arrived at his home, they say Hill handed them a number of photos that he said were of him and children at a local mall.

Police say a forensic analysis has not yet been completed but it is believed that all the photos are of children.

Hill was charged with three counts of possession of child pornography and released due to a publication ban. He is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 3.

Police were assisted by the FBI and the North American Internet Child Exploitation Coordination Centre (CIECC) during the investigation and are asking residents in the areas surrounding Hill's home, in the 1100 block of 13th Avenue, to come forward if they have any information that would help with the investigation.

Hill is described as a white male with dark hair and a light complexion. He stands roughly five-feet, eight-inches tall and weighs 160 pounds. He has a heavy build and was described as wearing a long sleeved black T-shirt, a long-sleeved white T-shirt, baggy red jeans, black work boots and dark shoes."
"The first person to see the original Star Wars films is not the original cast, but a group of film students from the University of Michigan are being hailed as heroes for having the audacity to do it.

With the help of a Google Map app called Google Earth and a camera that shoots 4K video, they took the unprecedented step to track down original footage of an earlier version of the movie and bring it to life.

The results speak for themselves: the team even managed to get a shot showing Luke Skywalker shooting a lightsaber - a very key moment in the original story - as well as the first-ever use of the word ""lava"" in a Star Wars film.

The student filmmakers were able to trace the original location of a film being filmed back at the time when George Lucas was only nine and the only film students in Michigan.


The team even managed to get a shot showing Luke Skywalker shooting a lightsaber - a very key moment in the original story - as well as the first-ever use of the word ""lava"" in a Star Wars film

Using some creative editing techniques, they took the images from the original film and used advanced special effects to bring them to life.

They also used an app called iMovie that converts the images to video, and that was used to turn the footage from the film into short movies.


Using some creative editing techniques, the students were able to translate the images into film and use a camera called a Nikon Coolpix 8-megapixel camera to capture the images

Mr Lucas said the idea of being the first to view the original Star Wars film was a dream come true.

He added: 'It's one of the greatest movie moments in history. It's one of three or four most iconic moments you can ever see.

'For people who have been watching Star Wars my whole life, it was such a big deal being one of the first people to see a scene from the original film.

"This post by John Lienhard, a financial writer at the Wall Street Journal, explains why the Fed is not in a position to increase interest rates any time soon and argues that it is probably not even in a position to start reducing rates anytime soon. As many of our readers know, he is known for his skepticism, and he has never before written an editorial this strong.

Here's the thing, Mr. Lienhard:

We have two Fed chairmen, who were successful as central bankers, in Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Yellen, who do not seem to want to take any action. Both are committed to keeping interest rates low, with Mr. Bernanke pushing rates to zero and Mr. Yellen wanting them to hit zero. And both of them think they are more effective if they keep raising rates than they would if they pulled them back. We all know what happens to a policy that is not in evidence and if the Fed starts pulling back, it looks like it is not doing anything to support the economy — and worse, that it is not even doing anything to try.

So I want to address that possibility…

You've also got two Fed vice chairmen, who are probably not as committed to the policy as Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Yellen, because they don't really have a lot of time. They just got to Washington this week on December 20 for a five-day winter meeting, and they will not report back until March 14th.

So what has happened?

In my view, the Fed has become something of a joke, in general. They have lost credibility as a safe place to be for market participants, whether it is the financial markets or investors in corporate America. They've lost credibility in terms of the media.

And they have lost credibility in terms of the Congress. There is now a huge sense within the Congress that the Fed has become a political tool rather than a policy maker. They are no longer willing to accept their analysis, either from the media or from the policymakers.

So to get back to my point, which is that if they don't start talking soon, it's unlikely that they will ever be able to start talking. The longer a situation goes on, the more the Fed becomes a political plaything. And Congress is no longer willing to accept anyone's views about the central bank.

So let me add an extra element to the mix on rate hikes; and let us also assume that our economic situation is as bad or worse than we are now being told. Let's say we have a recession now, not in 2016, but this year and that we are in some kind of recession that is so large that the Federal government no longer has the ability to do much stimulus — if it can even do much stimulus at all with all of its problems.

That then becomes a policy choice, which is exactly what"

"The second phase of the U.S. Army's modernization program is complete. The first phases are underway and will deliver additional capabilities and better performance to the Soldier, while supporting mission success on the battlefield.

The Army's Phase I Modernization Program, (MAP-I) was initiated during the summer of 2011 and will last until 2013. The program is comprised of two phases and encompasses a complete upgrade of the Soldier's equipment and weapon systems. Each phase includes:

Phase I Upgrade Program (IUPP) consists of five major stages designed to add capabilities and improve combat effectiveness.

During Phase I upgrade, the Soldier gains additional combat advantages using improved technology and a new arsenal of weapons and weapon systems, such as optics and optics variants and the Soldier's ability to move freely with higher mobility and mobility aids and gear support. The Soldier receives more equipment for his/her mission, and is provided with new combat gear including uniforms and equipment.


In Phase II, the Soldier must also remain proficient in the basic Soldier roles, and be equipped for a future combat environment and environment requirements.

During Phase II, the Soldier performs operational tasks more effectively without the need for support from others. The Soldier's job also requires the use of more advanced equipment, thus the Soldier must have these upgraded tools and equipments with them. These modernized tools and equipment can be worn on the Soldiers' bodies or carried on the Soldier's body.

During Phase III, the Soldier must remain fully proficient and functional in the mission even if the mission requires he or she to operate in a lower threat environment. The Soldier must maintain his/her basic skills to ensure proper mission effectiveness and safety.


The Soldier must be ready for all conditions of battle. The Soldier must also be able to adapt to any environment and be able to adapt to the needs of the mission.

Since the upgrade process is a three-phase process, there are a few requirements for the Soldier that must be met in each phase. If all requirements are met for the Soldier Phase I requirements, the Soldier receives the M1A3 Carbine (as part of the Individual Weapons Course and/or the rifle squad), and the Soldier becomes an Operational Artilleryman (AAT).

The Soldier must possess the following skills in each phase:

1. Qualified proficiency in hand movements, as well as target acquisition and firing of all weapons.

2. Qualified proficiency performing tasks with precision in a low-visibility or light-field environment and a general familiarity with the use of all main battle tank and tracked infantry weapons.

3. Qualified proficiency in maneuver in both the open ground and confined spaces.

4. Qualified proficiency in carrying out basic skills tasks by reading tactical maps (with or without the use of a laser device provided by the platoon).

5. Qualified proficiency in fire-control and basic battle management tasks"
"How to Build a New PC

I've been thinking a lot and have found a couple of great new ways to get an awesome PC for much less (and much more) than the cost of an entire new build. They include:

DIY PC build

DIY PSU build

DIY GPU build

Why are some new PC build so much cheaper?

If you've read my review of my latest build, it's pretty obvious that it would be nearly impossible to do any sort of PC build with such a small budget. That's why I've built a few less expensive PCs since. And it all stems from the fact that there are several methods to reduce the price of your new PC. Below is a list of the best of those.

DIY PC build

If you have ever wondered why your old computer wasn't doing better lately, it's because of its components. Those components, or lack thereof, will affect your computer's performance. What you will be looking for in a new build is new PC components. When choosing components for DIY builds, there are two important factors to consider. These are:

CPU Cooler

Motherboard

The CPU cooler is a major component in any PC build. Without a good CPU, your PC will struggle to complete its tasks. It also consumes a lot of energy. Luckily, there is a new way to get a lot of bang for your buck.

In the past, you may have had to replace your CPU a lot. This was because the CPU was built with outdated components. These obsolete products simply didn't perform as well as modern, higher-end CPUs do. But with a good budget CPU cooler, you now have alternatives. Some of the best PC coolers on the market include Cooler Master, Phanteks, Xigmatek, and even Cooler Master's own Phanteks PH-TC14PE CPU cooler. Check out these budget-friendly CPU coolers to see what type of performance you can expect:

A good PC is one that can last a long time. If you have a new PC, you can't afford to have your components break down.

When it comes to your motherboard, you need one that has good quality components. This is because motherboard issues can dramatically impact your entire PC. The easiest way to tell if a motherboard will be successful is to see if there's any damage. If there is, get one with replacement components. There are several different brands of memory out there for every type of PC. The cheaper the brand, the better. Check out which memory you need, where you get the memory, and how to choose the right type of memory for your PC, too.

A cool PC is one that allows for fast, lag-free performance. If you've ever tried playing games or doing any other activities while playing on an older PC, you knew that the"
"We got news this morning that the US Patent and Trademark Office officially published the first in a series of patent applications from the Apple Watch patent war. The application was first filed to the USPTO back in May of 2015 and is described as simply ""Mapping a user's location using a wireless device.""

When you think about Apple's original idea for the Apple Watch (or the original Apple Watch application, if you don't want to be bothered with looking at the patent filing data), it's obvious. The Apple Watch is a ""mapping"" device that, instead of tracking the location of your movements as you do those movements using a smartphone, uses a GPS chip to track where you are on your wrist. Apple even showed off a patent that would enable Apple to provide the Apple Watch application with a map. It seems obvious, but as Apple's watch patent applications go, this one is one of the most interesting and far reaching, which we explain below.

To get a sense of where Apple sees the Apple Watch in the future, we've dug into one of the patent applications for the device. As Apple's patent applications go, this one is one of the most interesting and far reaching, which you can check out by clicking here.

So… What does this patent application cover?

The first part of the application, as you see above, is just a single line description describing a wrist wearable device and how it relates to the Apple Watch. It lists several basic features of the device (like having a strap like that on the Apple Watch), a touch panel like that found on the Apple Watch, and then some details about the user-side of the device. This section also mentions a smartband, but the touch panel and the strap are not mentioned. So far that sounds pretty straight forward.

The second part of the application outlines the patent covering the device. It includes a listing of some of the more unique features of the device. While the iPhone doesn't have a touch panel, the touch panel on the iPhone 7 has a similar look and feel to a touch panel on the Apple Watch. It would suggest the Apple Watch would be using some technology similar to what's used in the iPad Pro's Touch ID fingerprint scanner. The second section then also includes a list of patents related to the Apple Watch. That is what makes this one so intriguing. The patent description contains a list of five patents related to the Apple Watch. While Apple's iPhone patent application covers the device's basic idea, the various patents cover a variety of new features. One list shows that the latest and most sought after patent has been for an infrared camera on the watch. It seems logical that the latest patent would cover the infrared camera, which will be found on the next-most sought after version of the Apple Watch, and which looks like a very promising addition to the Apple Watch's interface. If both the infrared camera and the smart band find a use"
"The Obama administration has on many an occasion used its power to make a federal court judge rule in a particular way.

This week it turned to U.S. District Judge Merrick Garland, a liberal judge nominated by President Bill Clinton, to decide a major patent case.

The case was brought by IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) against Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Apple Inc., which both say they shouldn't pay fees to the chipmaker for making their products with their technologies in the years after 2004.

IBM argues the patents they don't own shouldn't count toward the costs of bringing its products to market because they were filed before 2004, in the U.S. vs. Qualcomm case that started in 2007. The dispute centers around the royalties Qualcomm would have to pay Apple and others for using those patents with its semiconductors.

The federal judge is considering a trial date of Feb. 22, 2017 and a jury in Oakland has been asked to complete some preliminary work by March and April.

IBM and Qualcomm argue the case should be heard in the U.S. Federal District Court in San Jose because Apple can't argue its patents have been infringed in that jurisdiction. But since a federal judge has already approved the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled the case should proceed to trial in a San Jose court."
"A new type of bacteria was found in sea urchins collected off the coast of northern California. The bacteria is common in soil and water, but its origins have been uncertain, and was identified through DNA and molecular analysis.

Researchers at UC Santa Cruz's Marine Microbial Ecology Laboratory tested samples of the bacteria, known as Paramecium musae. They discovered that more than a third of the DNA samples came from marine organisms. The bacteria appears in nature all over the world—including in freshwater and terrestrial soil—but has never been found in marine organisms.

The researchers suggest that the unusual bacteria formed on the sea floor and were transported to the urchin communities by currents and currents in the water column. The results are published in the Nov. 13 edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

""This is really surprising, because it didn't occur anywhere I've looked,"" said Michael Tofel, a research assistant professor of marine sciences at Santa Cruz, who led the research. ""This finding suggests that something unusual happens to bacteria in marine environments. There's probably more to be found out there.

""There's no question that microbes from all over the universe travel up to the urchin,"" added Tofel. ""We think we'll be able to find other weird communities of microbes that have formed there.""

Bacteria are the most abundant and diverse life form on Earth.

Tofel and his co-workers started by studying the ecology and genetics of Paramecium musae, which is a marine microorganism closely related to microorganisms in aquatic environments.

When he removed the DNA from the urchin DNA, Tofel and his team found that a group of DNA sequences called plastid proteins did not match with known sequences found in marine bacterial DNA. This indicated that the marine bacteria may have been a new type of microorganism of their own, rather than just another type of marine bacterium.

Next, Tofel and colleagues sequenced about a third of the Paramecium musae genome and compared it with the DNA of other marine organisms. The researchers found that the marine bacteria were a distinct group of microorganisms distinct from the ones found in freshwater environments.

The researchers next asked how the marine bacteria came to be. They looked at the genes it possesses and found that in addition to the plastid proteins, it contains enzymes that help break down and digest plant carbohydrates. These enzymes may have been used by the marine bacteria to survive in a world full of algae, which are similar to plants but are found in salt water.

The marine bacteria could have been transported up the food chain by currents. However, they may have been able to survive from their coastal urchin hosts and later spread to other ocean waters.

Another mystery the research uncovered was how the bacteria reached the urchin communities. Some research has suggested that"

TORONTO -- A senior Federal Court judge says Quebec must allow women to wear face coverings while giving birth in hospitals.

In a decision released Monday, Justice Marie Deschamps says the province's decision to ban the niqab, or face covering, violates Charter rights of freedom of religion and expression.

The Quebec law was a ""shocking infringement"" on this right, Deschamps writes in her decision.

The law, which began in 2012, bans the wearing of face coverings by anyone who is in the public service, including firefighters and police officers.

Deschamps says the law is a safeguard to prevent religious extremists from using the niqab to hide their faces.

She says the law's intent ""is to make people feel comfortable around the person giving birth.""

The law was challenged by a woman who argued that the niqab is a symbol of female oppression.

The woman's lawyer argued that the law violates the right to religious freedom enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The Quebec government has repeatedly said the niqab should not be worn while giving birth.

But Deschamps says the right to religious freedom does not allow the government to impose a religious practice on all Quebecers.

The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the niqab ban in January."

SHANGHAI — Some of the world's biggest banks have been under scrutiny by American regulators for years, but until recently they were not subject to the same level of scrutiny as other companies doing business in the United States.

On Thursday, U.S. regulators said a number of the banks will be subject to a de facto ""heightened"" examination, a more rigorous examination than in the past that will be conducted through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator for the nation's largest banks.

In a regulatory filing, regulators said the number of banks subject to the heightened scrutiny will be 20. In addition to the 20 banks, other financial companies will also be subject to the new examination.

The increased scrutiny comes months after the financial crisis, when the OCC began scrutinizing a number of U.S. banks. The increased scrutiny is expected to result in higher fines.

The new examination is designed to scrutinize the banks' risk management and infrastructure, as well as their compliance with the rules that govern foreign banks. The new examination is currently being conducted by the OCC, which is part of the Treasury Department, and is not subject to the same level of scrutiny as the federal government's own banks.

The government will have the authority to impose fines up to $50 billion on the banks.

The new investigation ""is really about this particular industry, about how this particular industry has been operating,"" said Steve Welcher, the head of the OCC's enforcement division. ""How could we better position them for the future?""

In the past, the OCC has not required banks to undergo the same level of scrutiny as other companies doing business in the United States. The agency's scrutiny of banks was limited to whether they were complying with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as rules that govern banks' ability to do business with the United States.

The OCC has not conducted this kind of examination of U.S. banks, and there have not been any further investigations of U.S. banks since the financial crisis. But the agency has had a handful of audits of U.S. banks, led by Mr. Welcher and his team. In some cases, the regulators expressed concerns about bank governance and other practices, from the way banks were managed to the way they managed their capital reserves.

In the past, regulators with the OCC have focused on the rules that govern banks' operations outside of the United States. In 2012, regulators raised questions about whether banks had paid enough taxes in the United States or complied with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

In 2013, regulators raised questions about the way the banks had managed their stock holdings, and in 2014, regulators raised questions about the way the banks had managed their risk.

The OCC has also raised concerns about the practices of the banks in recent years, including the"
"The D.C. United franchise, which has never won an MLS Cup, has its eyes on a new trophy.

The Red Bulls have one.

With a 3-0 victory over the Philadelphia Union on Saturday, D.C. United clinched second place in the East after a 2-0 victory against the New England Revolution.

The Red Bulls will be in the thick of the playoff race, with games against the Columbus Crew, Montreal and the Houston Dynamo remaining.

United's success has been remarkable, but has at times felt like a Cinderella story, given the odds stacked against it. The Red Bulls have been the league's best team in the regular season for nearly a decade.

But the Red Bulls are not out of it, and the club has the ultimate goal of winning the Supporters' Shield, the trophy that goes to the team with the most points at the end of the regular season.

With a win over the Union on Sunday, D.C. United will be in the hunt for the Shield.

United (14-6-10, 44 points) has won eight of its last 10 games, including victories over the New York Red Bulls and Philadelphia Union.

""We're taking this game very seriously,"" United coach Ben Olsen said. ""I'm focused on the fact that if we're going to win this match, we're going to have to win it with the same intensity as we did against New York.

""San Jose (last weekend) was a tough match. But we felt like we had to win that game, because we needed to regroup and get back to playing the type of football we know we can play.""

The Red Bulls (10-11-11, 40 points) have lost four of their last six games, including 2-1 losses to the Vancouver Whitecaps and Philadelphia Union.

They were eliminated from playoff contention last weekend, falling to the Portland Timbers in a penalty-kick shootout.

""We didn't play well enough"" in the loss, goalkeeper Luis Robles said. ""We need to be better in those situations.""

United has won its last 10 road games against the Red Bulls.

"The San Diego Chargers have acquired right tackle D.J. Fluker from the Oakland Raiders in exchange for a conditional fourth-round pick in next year's draft, the team announced.

The move is a notable one for the Chargers, who have struggled on the offensive line this season. The Chargers currently rank 27th in the NFL in points allowed per game (26.4) while the club's run percentage has plummeted to 80.3 percent, the second-worst mark in the league.

In his five starts this season, Fluker has allowed a total of 13 total pressures, including seven sacks. Fluker's struggles have been most noticeable in run blocking, where he has allowed six total pressures as well as one hurry.

After starting the season as the starting right tackle, Fluker has been moved to the left side in recent weeks. However, he remains the team's starting right tackle.

The Raiders have also released wide receiver Jack Crawford and cornerback D.J. Hayden.

The Chargers are also expected to sign tackle D.J. Fluker to a new contract. AP Photo/Jae C. Hong

Fluker was originally drafted by the Raiders in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft. The Chargers gave him a four-year, $5.5 million contract extension last offseason."

"The famed legendary baseball player and community leader, Babe Ruth, has passed away at the age of 91.

The famed legendary baseball player and community leader, Babe Ruth, has passed away at the age of 91.

The legendary legendary baseball player and community leader, Babe Ruth, has passed away at the age of 91.

Babe Ruth, the National Baseball Hall of Fame baseball great who will forever be known as ""The Babe,"" has died. He was 91 years old.

""Turns out, the Babe has passed away,"" said Hall of Fame pitcher and broadcaster, Bob Gibson. ""I'm very sad for the Babe's family and loved ones. He was one of the most popular, beloved figures in the history of the game and throughout the world. He will be missed.""

A native of nearby Gleason's Mills, Ruth had a star turn as a 19-year-old rookie in the National League in 1916. In a 41-1 loss to the New York Giants, a game that would go down as the greatest in baseball history, the former first baseman hit a walk-off grand slam to give the Kansas City Monarchs a 4-3 win over the Giants.

Ruth went on to become a star, winning the Most Valuable Player award in the 1916 season. After World War II broke out in Europe, Ruth was drafted by the New York Yankees and later signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers. His reputation as a superstar made him a household name throughout the world.

In addition to his baseball career, Ruth was an author, a philanthropist, a business magnate and a champion of civil rights. He is the only person to have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame twice, and was also the first to be the subject of a documentary film.

Ruth's first love was baseball, and he was an avid fan of the Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, the Boston Braves, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs.

""Babe Ruth was an amazing person,"" said legendary New York Yankees manager, Joe McCarthy. ""He was the greatest baseball player of his generation and his memory will live on forever.""

Ruth was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. Earlier this year, Gibson said he was happy to be inducted into the same class as Ruth.

""I was very honored to be inducted into the same class as Babe Ruth,"" he said. ""I don't know if I could have ever achieved what he did. I wish I could have played with him, but I have a lot of regrets about my career, so I can't say that I would have been successful playing with the Babe.""

After his playing career ended, Ruth moved to Boston and worked as a newspaper reporter. After retiring from baseball, he became a community leader in the city of Boston, donating money to schools and hospitals. He"

"A young female police officer is dead and another has been injured after the pair were hit by gunfire in the east end of Montreal Friday afternoon.

The Montreal Police's chief say he does not believe the officers were in any danger, however, and that investigations are continuing.

Witnesses say the gunfire erupted around 3:30 p.m. when a group of people began to fight on the corner of St. Laurent and Victoria streets.

""Suddenly, an officer saw a lady in the middle of the street and just shot straight behind her,"" witness Paul Larocque told CBC Radio's Daybreak.

""She was on the ground and her friend was in the arms of the police,"" he said. ""Then they shot her in the head.""

The two officers, who have not yet been identified, were airlifted to hospital but later died when they arrived.

One of the injured officers was a 20-year veteran of the force, according to Montreal police.

'They are heroes'

""They are heroes,"" a witness said of the young officers, who came to help when they heard the commotion.

""They saved a lot of lives.""

One police cruiser was reportedly riddled with bullet holes.

'We need to do more'

The neighbourhood where the shooting occurred is one inhabited mostly by young women, including many prostitutes and drug addicts, CBC Montreal reported. It had been a peaceful place to walk, a witness said.

""Everybody knows everybody,"" Larocque said. ""If you walk on that street and you don't go out, nobody even knows you. You can walk down that street, your mom doesn't know you.""

Police arrived on scene within minutes but the fight never ended, witnesses said.

Police spokesman Ian Lafrenière told reporters at the scene that it is unclear what sparked the fight.

There were reports that one of the police officers used a Taser before she eventually fired. ""It could have been worse,"" Lafrenière said. ""We cannot be certain that none of our officers was hurt.""

A large number of police cars converged on the scene, and many officers carried out shields. Officers were using video cameras to help identify potential witnesses."
"Mississauga's Eaton Centre is a popular place to shop and dine for many reasons.

But what is it that makes the Eaton Centre so great, and why people love going to it?

Many people believe that one reason for the popularity is because the Eaton Centre is the largest shopping mall in the world.

However, are the Eaton Centre's shoppers happy?

According to a report by The Economist, the answer to that question is ""no"".

The report highlights the fact that the mall is a money-loser for the city, and residents have little to no say in whether the mall stays or goes.

The mall regularly loses money in the summer, and the report mentions that the city rarely receives any revenue from the mall.

The report also highlights the fact that the mall attracts many international tourists, but the city doesn't receive any of the revenue.

Korn Ferry is the mall's owner. The report mentions that the mall paid Korn Ferry $6.5 million in the last fiscal year.

The report also mentions the fact that the mall has had trouble with its finances, as it has struggled to pay its vendors, which are also usually the city's vendors.

The report says that the mall has had a poor track record of attracting customers, and the store owners have had to increase rent to attract shoppers.

In addition to the mall's problems, the report says that the city of Mississauga has not received any revenue from the mall since it opened.

A spokesperson for the mall says that the mall regularly loses money in the summer, and the city rarely receives any revenue from the mall. (CBC)

The report also mentions some of the issues that the mall has had with its employees.

The report says that the mall has had to pay out millions of dollars to its employees.

The employees have complained that they are not paid enough, and that they are not given adequate health and safety protections, as well as benefits.

"A top US Army general ordered the Pentagon to suspend a planned deployment of troops to Libya after a top Libyan officer said the plan could spark unrest in the country.

Officials said it was still possible the US would move forward with the plan to protect a key air base outside Benghazi following a threat from Islamist militia to attack US personnel in retaliation.

But General Carter Ham, the Air Force's top officer, said last week that a planned deployment of more than 500 troops would not make sense with the deteriorating security situation in Libya and no assurances that their presence would not lead to military confrontation with the Libyans.

""The plan to protect a U.S. military base in Benghazi was reviewed and evaluated,"" Ham said. ""The plan was determined to be unworkable. That assessment remains current; however, we will not be proceeding with such an operation.""

The news came as a US official confirmed that an aircraft carrier, the USS Kearsarge sailed into the eastern Mediterranean in the first such operation since a NATO campaign began in 2011. The carrier is part of the carrier strike group that is being sent to the area to help monitor the security situation surrounding the embattled Libyan capital.

The Kearsarge is part of the Naval forces regional security team, which includes six destroyers and cruisers, the 7th Fleet said on Monday. The USS America and three other destroyers will also be deployed to the Middle East."
"Zurich - Switzerland's central bank has revealed that it is investigating a possible breach of its computer network used to regulate the country's banking sector.

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) said on Friday that it was looking into reports that a few employees in its information technology department had access to confidential data of customers of the central bank.

While the central bank said it was unable to comment on the specific case, it said its systems were ""in a safe and secure state"".

The SNB said it would not confirm the identities of its employees and was working with the authorities.

The central bank has a network of around 4,000 computers spread across the country.

It said it had had a ""few recent reports of suspected cyber-espionage"" and had launched an internal investigation.

The bank said the investigation would take several weeks. ""We will make no further comment on the matter,"" it added.

Swiss media reported that the possible breach involved a software programme used by the SNB to manage its computer network.

Cyber security experts said the possible breach was not related to the recent cyber attack on the world's biggest bank, JPMorgan Chase.

""This is certainly not the sort of thing that would be acceptable in the banking world,"" said Tony Sebro, head of cyber security at security firm Check Point.

The data breach would have affected not only the financials of the SNB, but also the statistics of the Swiss postal service and financial institutions, the Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger reported.

The SNS, which is also known as the SNB's ""asset management department"", is responsible for all assets that are central to Switzerland's financial system.

The scandal over JPMorgan's data breach has widened the debate over the role of the banks and central banks in a world where hackers are increasingly targeting companies and organisations.

The SNB has been hit by a series of high-profile security breaches in recent years.

In 2011, a hacking attack on the bank's computer system forced it to halt payments to a large number of Swiss residents.

And in 2012, hackers stole around $81m from the bank by breaking into its computer system and stealing information on more than 30,000 customers.

The SNB has also been badly hit by a series of cyber attacks, including a breach in 2004 that caused $1.2bn in damages."
"I can't quite remember which came first, I guess it might have been both.


Back to the present.

Well, I'm looking through some old correspondence and I discovered that I was on the verge of getting this book (not yet published) a couple of years ago. This is in my personal library, and was written in 2002, so I was looking at some older versions of the cover design.


The writing is pretty good. And there's some really nice color pictures of the world of the story. It was written at that time, or perhaps during the early part of this year.


But here's the thing: I can't remember why I decided to read it and, most importantly, why I decided to write about it. I feel like this might be a book for some people, but this is a first person account written for a non-fan.


My reasons for wanting to read this book include:


1. To have a more complete understanding of what I've read previously.

2. To have a better idea of what happens in this novel.


I can't remember if I remember the exact quote I gave above or not. But here's what it was: ""I can't quite remember why I decided to read it and, most importantly, why I decided to write about it.""


The book deals with some of the events that I would describe as ""the war"". In the course of the novel, I discovered something about the world and it's society that was completely new to me. It was hard to put it into words, but it was the sort of info that the real world couldn't teach me at all. So, if I think about it, a lot of time is spent figuring out what goes on in this world, how it gets worked out, and how the characters deal with it, and how things are resolved.


Also, this is the first time I had the feeling that I wasn't in the book, that I wasn't in the world of the book. This was something that I was used to reading about, but I wasn't really looking for.


Also, this first time, I read it with a friend of mine in mind. When I finished reading the book and I put it away, I couldn't stop thinking about it. It was sort of a ""How would I react in a situation like this?"" sort of feeling. I'm not sure why.


Here's the thing, though: I read and re-read the story a couple of times to try and figure out what happened or what would happen next, so I wasn't totally lost. But, as I said above, I can't remember what the actual reasons were for wanting to read the first time.


Also, I am a fan of science fiction. A lot of fantasy, and of course, mystery/adventure/thr"
"ROCKVILLE, Md. (WJZ) — Maryland's infant mortality rate is now the highest in the nation.

Maryland's infant mortality rate is now the highest in the U.S.

The latest figures show the state's rate is 22.5 per 1,000 babies born.

That's the highest rate in the country and nearly double the national rate of 14.2 per 1,000.

The data shows the infant mortality rate is higher than it was before the recession.

The new numbers are based on 2014 data.

The state's infant mortality rate is twice what it was in 2001.

The state's infant mortality rate was 5.1 per 1,000 in 2001, but was 9.8 per 1,000 in 2013.

Researchers say there are a number of factors at play.

They say the income gap is a big factor.

""We know that the rate of poverty is one of the main causes of infant mortality,"" said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, the Director of the Institute for Health Equity at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Researchers say the infant mortality rate is not just higher in urban areas.

""There are some areas of the state where it's so high that it's essentially a state of emergency,"" Fielding said.

The state's infant mortality rate is also higher among black and Hispanic babies.

The data also show that more than one in five babies born in Baltimore City are born prematurely.

""The challenge that we have is that there's a lot of premature birth, and there's a lot of problems that a lot of premature birth can cause,"" Fielding said.

The data show it costs Maryland an estimated $1.1 billion per year to care for premature babies.

The state is also trying to curb the number of babies born to mothers who smoke.

Nearly one-third of all babies born to teens in Maryland are premature, and more than one-third are born to mothers who smoke.

Both are linked to adverse health outcomes, including shorter lives.

The state's infant mortality rate is the second highest in the country.

The CDC says Maryland's rate is lower than the national average, but is still higher than the U.S. rate of 13.5 per 1,000.

The state's infant mortality rate is also among the highest in the nation for black babies and Hispanics."

Detailed Walkthrough: The Daedric Prince Mephala

Mephala's Lair [ edit ]

Once you have completed The Black Star, you'll find that Mephala has returned with a new plan for the current situation: to send you back in time to the First Era, when the Dragon Break happened. A letter from Mephala has been delivered to your doorstep. It is signed by Mephala personally and is addressed to you. You will need to read the letter, which contains information about Mephala's plans, to gain further information.

Mephala: The Lessons of the Daedra [ edit ]

The letter contains a number of instructions, but the most important of these is: ""The lessons of the Daedra are the lessons of the fabled Chimer and Dwemer."" The letter is written in the style of a letter from Mephala to a mortal.

Mephala: The Lessons in the Dark Arts [ edit ]

""Dark arts"" is the term Mephala uses to refer to the art of necromancy: the art of summoning undead creatures. When you first read this letter, you will learn that Mephala is attempting to advise you on how to use the dark arts, which is an art of necromancy. When you have completed the main quest, you will receive the Dark Arts skill book The Dark Arts.

The letter also states that Mephala ""learned from the old masters the dark arts of summoning in a time when the Daedra were at the height of their power."" This statement is in reference to the previous quest (The Black Star), in which Mephala suggests that the Daedric Prince Azura gave the Chimer a gift of summoning magic from the beginning.

Mephala: The Art of Sithis [ edit ]

When you have read the letter, you will receive the Art of Sithis Skill Book: The Art of Sithis.

The Art of Sithis is an arcane book which explains the methods of summoning the Daedra. It is written in the style of an ancient Daedric scholar's notebook. It is detailed in detail about the Daedric Princes, describing their strengths and weaknesses, and how to summon them. What it does not mention is the summoning of Mephala; that is a task for the Daedric Prince Mephala, who is represented by two glyphs displayed on the book's cover.

Mephala: The Plan [ edit ]

If you have read the letter, you will receive a letter with a further instruction from Mephala: ""Find the portal to Dagon's realm and open it. He will be waiting."" M"
"""In the end, all the little girls are just like you"".

If you've been spending time around the world, you've met a great many women, and almost none of them are like me. I do sometimes wish it were different. For a long time, I couldn't figure out why it felt so familiar; so like home. I was a 19-year-old American woman in her native land, and I was so overwhelmed by this, that I did something I'm not proud of: I went home and started dating a 19-year-old from India. This is what happened.

My parents met in the States and we were never very close, but I always felt very comfortable as a child growing with her brother and sister. My brother got his first computer when he was 10 and immediately wanted to play video games, which we all did. My sister was already interested in computers, though she didn't get that far. Like most American teens, she gravitated towards fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons—or the very similar Final Fantasy. This is what happened.

Then, in the summer of 2000, she got her first real computer; a Compaq Presario. My parents had to stop their weekly computer lesson to let my brother and sister use it. I had been thinking of going abroad, but the Compaq was so impressive that my parents didn't want me to go—at least, there wasn't a serious answer to the question of why. She had a computer! She could do anything on it, I was told; she could make art, cook for her friends' lunch, build an app, design a magazine. We watched with fascination as this Indian woman who wanted nothing else but to do computer science, began to learn BASIC, the programming language we were used to, along with any other subject she found interesting.

She did, too. I'm not the only one. Since that fateful year of 2002, dozens of her friends have been asking me to marry them, all in the space of an 18-month span.

I can give a simple answer: she doesn't make me feel like a princess, and I don't understand why I shouldn't be able to feel that way. (Although, that's not to excuse her, either, in particular!) For the record: I feel like a princess in the same way that my friends feel like princesses. If I do anything to make them feel like princesses, I feel like I've failed. I can empathise with it, but I don't want to, or can't, do much. The last thing I want to do is make them feel stupid or helpless. This is why I'm not doing this.

At this moment, in the world, I am very, very happy. I have a good job and I am making a career out of building software. This is what"
"This article, written by Richard Morgan, originally appeared on the site for the book. The article discusses the use of the term ""camel hump"" as a cultural and linguistic phenomenon.

In his book, Camel hump: The Secret History of Camel Teeth, Robert B. Caro details what he believes to be the origin of the term ""camel hump"" that has become the basis of our concept of the ""big cat"" today. The term derives from the Middle East, specifically from the Arabian Peninsula. In his introduction, Caro points out that ""The only Arabic source that describes and describes this phenomenon is a little-known Arabic document (known as the 'Book of Dreams') that was brought into the country from Arabia around the time of the Ottoman Empire."" This source is from the book, Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah (also known as ""The History of Al-Muqaddimah"").

As he describes, the ""little-known"" book contains ""more than 500 chapters about what is termed, for our purposes here, the ""Arabian Nights"" and which is, among other things, a sort of dream record of the Arabian Nights, and also of an imaginary city of the same name."" Ibn Khaldun was an Arabian historian, who in the 17th century began his scholarly studies. As Caro summarizes, Ibn Khaldun's ""research has become deeply entwined with the origins of Islamic fundamentalism and its relationship to the development of the European colonization of the Holy Land."" Ibn Khaldun is considered, by some, the father of modern Arabism and Islamic fundamentalism.

It is this source, Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah, that Caro points out as the origin of the ""camel hump"" of the ""big cat,"" as he calls it today. Caro, as he says, believes that the term originates in an Arab myth created by Ibn Khaldun.

Caro describes that Ibn Khaldun's book contains ""stories, legends and legend-building. Stories are told of camel-hump episodes involving a group of heroes who were supposedly the first Arab conquerors of the Holy Land."" In his book, Caro presents a number of ""fabrications of the past"" in Ibn Khaldun that is found in the Muqaddimah, and Caro concludes that these inventions are the ""the genesis for the 'big cat'. The whole myth of Arab conquest of Jerusalem is based on this story and the invented tales of a'magic camel.'""

In his book, Ibn Khaldun goes on to explain that in the ""Book of Dreams"", that we refer to as the ""Camel Hoop"", we find references about how ""King Solomon's temple is located in a cave, and that it is there that the Arabs built their temple. The Jews are now living in the cave,"

"The Best of the Best

The best of the best are the most sought after, because they are the ones that are done right. Here are the top 10 best public Muslim men in New York.

In the most recent survey of Muslim men in the United States, 32 percent of them are divorced, according to a Pew Research Center report.

In fact, divorce is the most common cause of men's dissatisfaction with their marriages. Forty-four percent of men said they want to divorce and get out. Only 28 percent of women who were surveyed said that they wanted to stay married to their husbands.

Muslim men, who are more likely to be divorced, report higher rates of sexual dissatisfaction with their wives. Some 62 percent of them reported that their sexual desire was low.

But the Muslim men who do divorce tend to stay in the United States.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2009, the total number of Muslim American men living in the U.S. was 2.7 million. This was a slight decrease from the 2.8 million Muslim American men that lived in the U.S. in 2008.

The number of Muslim men living in New York City has also increased. Since 2011, the number of Muslim men living in New York has increased by more than 27,000. More than 95 percent of them are in the East Side of Manhattan.

This is according to a survey conducted by the American Muslim Population Survey, which was conducted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-NY) and the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC). The survey was conducted in eight languages.

The survey was conducted between December 2012 and March 2013.

The top 10 Muslim men in New York were selected based on the following criteria:

1. Some or all of the following characteristics were reported by at least 10 percent of the men surveyed: Age: 20-39 years; 40-59 years; 60 or older; Married or living with a partner; American-born; Education: High school or less; some college; graduate school; postgraduate study; Religion: Muslim; According to the survey, 55 percent of the men surveyed said they were Muslim.

2. The following characteristics were reported by at least 10 percent of the men surveyed: Sexually active: Yes

3. The following characteristics were reported by at least 10 percent of the men surveyed: Sexual desire: Low

4. The following characteristics were reported by at least 10 percent of the men surveyed: Marriage status: Married or not

"The Apple-designed ""iPhone SE"" goes on sale on Friday, and the company has revealed that it's no longer making the iPhone 5.

Analysts had expected Apple to shift production of its lower-cost iPhone 5 to its higher-end iPhone 6 line, which it launched in September. But while Apple announced last week that it's producing the new iPhone 6s, it's not producing the iPhone 6.

Apple sent out invites to its retail stores in the U.S. and U.K. on Friday and confirmed to Fortune that the iPhone SE is the new iPhone. The new iPhone 6s will be available on Friday, too, for $199 with a two-year contract.

In a statement, Apple said that it ""is no longer making iPhone 5 units,"" and that it will be producing the iPhone SE starting in ""early November.""

The iPhone SE is the company's cheapest iPhone to date, and its lower-cost model will be the first to offer a 4.7-inch screen. It is also the first iPhone in years to include a fingerprint sensor, which so far has been absent from the iPhone 5.

Apple will sell the iPhone SE through its online and retail stores in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Korea, and it will be available in more than 60 countries.

The iPhone SE was revealed last week, and will be available in black, grey, white, gold, and rose gold. It also comes with a $99 (AU$181) one-year subscription to Apple Music.

Apple will be offering special deals to customers who pre-order the iPhone SE starting on Friday at midnight. The deals include a $50 (AU$75) discount on the iPhone SE when you buy an iPhone 5s and a $50 (AU$75) discount on the iPhone SE when you buy an iPhone 6s.

Apple has been working hard to position the iPhone SE as ""the next evolution of the iPhone,"" according to a note from Nomura analyst Mark Moskowitz. ""The iPhone SE is like the smaller, lighter, more affordable version of the iPhone 6s. It has a similar look to the iPhone 6s, but it is more affordable,"" he wrote."
"As of April 5, 2016, the United States is poised to launch its first orbital defense system. While the US Department of Defense is the lead agency for the new system, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency or DTRA is the lead agency for the space control mission itself, and is responsible for planning and coordinating international space situational awareness and defense from space (SSA).

The Space Control Mission

The SSA of the U.S. orbital defense posture is the ability to observe, collect, and coordinate the use of space-based assets from across the globe. SSA is also a means for the U.S. to communicate and coordinate its space warfare capabilities.

For several years the US has been conducting testing and research on space based sensors in order to understand, predict, anticipate, and defeat the threats posed by potential adversaries. For instance, NASA has used a number of satellites and sensors to monitor space weather and track objects in space. This activity is designed to ensure that NASA's programs remain ready to operate at any time the space environment can be disrupted.

In other cases, NASA space missions have also observed and tracked potentially hostile space assets such as orbital debris and space debris ""satellites"". While some of these objects are known to be part of other nation's space systems, they could pose dangerous threat to space systems or to spacecraft operating in space without the right protections from orbital debris. Such objects could also damage satellites.

The Orbital Defense Mission

The Orbital Defense Mission, also known as OT-3E, is a space control mission for a small number of US satellites, and the first U.S.-specific space defense mission. The OT-3E mission is designed to validate military plans and procedures for responding to a nuclear attack by a potential adversary or terrorist utilizing orbital space assets.

The Orbital Defense Module (ODM) is the U.S. component that will monitor, position and deploy orbital assets to defend the US against attack. The ODM is the backbone of the US orbital defense system using the most advanced technology in the world, including high resolution cameras, lasers, communications links, and sensors to collect, track, and communicate with space assets.

There are three elements to the US Orbital Defense Mission, which includes:

OBOTS – the Orbital Defense Obelisk (ODM)

S-2000 – the Space Control Node (SCN)

LOLA-G – the Orbital Lander (OL)

The Orbital Defense Obelisk (ODM) is the core of the US Orbital Defense Mission. It will comprise three spacecraft: an unmanned satellite, an unmanned spacecraft, and a satellite which was formerly called the Orbital Lander (OL). The ODM will be launched into the stratosphere, where it will perform the functions of the two spacecraft and will act as a launch vehicle for the ISS and a Space Control Pod. It will then rendezvous"
"If there are two things that a Republican politician is more likely to do than support the use of military force abroad, it's ignore the consequences and go golfing.

As of today the White House confirmed that they're about to send their latest White House Intern, Caitlin Hayden, back on the golf course.

A White House official confirmed in a statement to CNN that Hayden has been sent back to her homeland security post at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia for the start of National Security Council (NSC) work. Hayden had been scheduled to move from Langley to the White House last month.

SPONSORED

What that tells us is that the White House hasn't yet decided where Hayden is going to play this weekend.

Meanwhile, President Obama and his top advisors are having a private ""working vacation"" in Hawaii (the official vacation is in Camp David), with the President scheduled to return to Washington and report back to the nation on national security policy the third week of January.

Meanwhile, members of the White House briefing room are reportedly on vacation in another part of the United States along with other cabinet officials in the wake of an avalanche of bad news stories about national security from over the last few days.

The good news for President Obama is that there are some very good golf courses that he can keep at his disposal when he goes on vacation."

"The presence of a gene that confers resistance to the malaria parasite in the African continent has been known for a long time. Although the details of the co-curative nature of the gene remain unclear, the presence of the gene has been widely assumed, and the association of the gene with human immunity is well established. However, the small scale of the association between the malaria gene and immunity within the African continent is surprising. We present data showing that the presence of the malaria gene is not restricted to the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region, but that the same gene also has a very high frequency in Western Europe and North America. The high frequency of the malaria gene in North America supports the hypothesis that the malaria gene is a more recent acquisition of immunity than previously thought.

Previous research has shown that certain polymorphisms of the malaria gene can confer resistance to malaria [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. However, the mechanisms by which these polymorphisms lead to resistance to malaria are not known. A recent study showed that a single polymorphism of the malaria gene can increase the efficacy of a particular antimalarial drug, but these effects are only seen in humans carrying a particular allele [28]. The association of alleles of the malaria gene with immunity in humans has been previously demonstrated [29], [30], [31], [32].

Malaria is a preventable disease that kills millions of people each year, especially children, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. It is one of the most prevalent and most deadly viral diseases, and is the leading cause of death from a neglected tropical disease.

It has been known for a long time that the malaria parasite is found in humans, although the precise nature of the association has been unclear. A number of studies have shown that the malaria parasite is present in homing pigeons and wild rats, and that the malaria gene is present in humans [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. However, the presence of the malaria gene in humans has been considered an established fact, and its association with immunity in humans was postulated [13], [14], [15].

A number of studies have shown that the malaria parasite is found in humans, although how this association is acquired remains unclear.

"Let's not forget that the UX design process is also the process of discovery. A UX designer can discover and discover the experience of a user through a series of experiments, and they can use a UX research tool like DoubleClick to collect information about the user and the website they're visiting.

Google's Client Experience Report is a great example of a UX research tool that allows you to collect data on your users and the site they're visiting. Google's report helps you understand:

How interested they are in the content on the site

This data will help you understand how your website is being experienced by your users.

Once you have collected data, you can use the data to run additional UX research to understand your users' needs and preferences.

When I started using Google's Client Experience Report, I was surprised at the results. I thought that most people would be interested in the site and the content on the site, but I was wrong.

A recent study showed that only 17% of users were interested in the information on the site. More importantly, only 9% of them were interested in the content. This means that only 2% of users were interested in the content, and the rest weren't interested in the content.

When you think about it, this makes sense. When you visit a website, you are probably looking for information. Your browser doesn't care what is on the website, as long as you get the information you need.

The point of the research is to determine which information is most important to the user.

With this in mind, you can test these results by creating a test page. This is a page that is designed to test the information on the website. If you're going to do this, you might as well use a test page that the site is familiar with.

Creating a test page

"A Federal Court judge has ordered two of the country's leading medical journals to remove references to the mercury-containing compound thimerosal from their pages.

The decision, issued today, comes after a complaint by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the and a string of articles in the journals that appear to be promoting the use of thimerosal in vaccines. The decision is the first time a federal judge has ordered the removal of any references to thimerosal from a medical journal.

In a joint statement today, the NRDC and the AAP announced the decision. ""The courts have spoken,"" said David Suzuki, director of the NRDC's Sabin Vaccine Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ""This is a victory for the health of American children. Thimerosal is a poison and should be removed from vaccines.""

In his ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Edward R. Korman wrote that ""it is impermissible for a court to declare policy based on incomplete information on such a controversial issue."" Korman also wrote that ""the scientific community has not reached a consensus on the safety of thimerosal.""

National Vaccine Information Center executive director Julie Gerberding, who helped organize the lawsuit, said in a statement today that the decision makes it clear that ""we have made our point. The federal government must listen to the scientific community and remove thimerosal from vaccines, and we will continue to work to achieve that goal.""

Thimerosal, which is used in most childhood vaccines, has been a source of controversy in recent years, particularly because of studies suggesting that it may be linked to autism. Today, the CDC recommends that children receive only one dose of thimerosal-containing vaccines, including the MMR vaccine.

In his ruling, Korman said that ""the scientific community has not reached a consensus."" He noted that the National Research Council, which advises the CDC, issued a report in 1997 that stated that thimerosal's safety was ""limited at best, with no clear evidence of an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children who received thimerosal-containing vaccines.""

""The scientific community is not in agreement as to the safety of thimerosal,"" Korman wrote. ""There are, however, a number of experts in the field who have expressed views on the subject. The scientific community has therefore decided not to take a position on the issue.""

Korman also noted that the National Academy of Sciences, in a report issued in 2001, said that ""there is no scientific evidence to support the contention that thimerosal in vaccines causes autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.""

The lawsuit was brought by the NRDC and other groups, including the AAP and the Concerned Mothers of Infants, a group that supports parents' right to choose what vaccines their children receive.

"A former Navy SEAL whose identity was stolen after he made a video in 2007 of killing Osama bin Laden has sued the U.S. government, alleging it's not doing enough to deter identity theft.

Lawyers for Robert O'Neal allege that Defense Department officials are so overwhelmed by the sheer number of cases they're dealing with that they're missing key steps by not adequately screening applicants.

The former Navy SEAL is one of several government agencies, including the FBI, State Department, and the Homeland Security Department, named as defendants in the suit, filed in U.S. district court in Washington.

The lawsuit alleges that the Defense Department and other agencies are failing to make ""significant investigative"" efforts or screening of applicants whose identities have been stolen. O'Neal made a 2007 YouTube video with some of his former colleagues, the suit claims, and asked a former SEAL friend to post it on YouTube.

The video prompted a group of Navy SEALs who worked with O'Neal to organize a team to raid the al-Qaeda leader's compound in Pakistan. The raid was a disaster, and O'Neal wasn't there after it.

After two years, a former SEAL friend of O'Neal's asked the Pentagon to search public records for him. The Defense Department found a partial identification on a photo album that was taken when O'Neal was recruited and when he was serving at the SEALs' North Carolina training center in 2008.

The lawsuit says O'Neal was told about the identification, but he was never told that it had been stolen. It alleges that when the Defense Department found the record, it allowed the Navy SEALS at Fort Bragg to move the case to its records portal, the Defense Human Resources Activity.

The lawsuit says the Defense officials knew the Pentagon portal could have allowed access to a large database of public records about the applicants but didn't take steps to ensure their applications there were scrutinized.

The suit says the Defense Department failed to conduct interviews, make determinations, and follow up with the applicants to get information about the stolen identity."

The first time we heard there was a new release, we didn't want to buy it. After we had, and were happily impressed, we got the keys to a review copy. After the test drive and the second, third, etc. go-round the reviews started pouring in. Now we're a few weeks later and many of you are still using your new copy. It's all very exciting (we're really happy for you!) but it's also frustrating to write a review. We've seen more than our fair share of reviews that are simply copy and paste job, or even blatantly biased. And now, for today's question, we're going to tell you what our reviewers really think:

This time they're offering a bit of advice (hilarious in its own way of course!). It's not necessarily the most important part of their reviews, but it's good to know what they have learned throughout their time with the game.

So how do they grade the game? Well, they go to the good points, then all the bad, and finally down to the really ""meh"" and ""useless"". We picked their favorites and comments based on their observations of the game so far. Enjoy!

The Game: Dragon Quest Monsters 2: I Love You Dragon Quest Monsters 2.

Reviewer 1:

""I Love You Dragon Quest Monsters (it's a great title) is a monster of a game. A wonderful example of how well Square Enix has integrated Monster Monpiece into the series.

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told a small group of visiting leaders from some of the world's largest oil producers on Saturday that the Islamic Republic was open to a peaceful resolution of its nuclear dispute with the West.

In his meeting with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman, Khamenei said Tehran was ready to discuss ""any reasonable and reasonable solution"" to its dispute with the West over its nuclear program, state TV reported.

""We have always been open and ready to consider any reasonable and reasonable solution that brings about the interests of the people of Iran,"" he said.

Khamenei and his top aides have repeatedly said they need time to study the possible options that are on the table.

The Iranian leader was visiting the National Council of Resistance of Iran, a group of opposition groups that the West says is a front for Tehran's Revolutionary Guards and has been at the center of an international standoff since the disputed election of former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009.

The 13-member National Council of Resistance of Iran has been meeting in secret since last month, when it announced the formation of a negotiating team with the United States and other powers."
"How much did the world consume in total last year in the form of carbon dioxide emissions?

On the first day of World Environment Day on Tuesday, November 3, 2015, the Paris-based United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced the latest annual data to tally carbon dioxide emissions from every nation, both developed and developing. The data is measured in metric tons CO2 equivalent and compares the total carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of the entire world in 2013 to the 2013 CO2 equivalent emissions from all nations across the world.

This new carbon dioxide emissions data is not directly comparable to previous ones as they include only emissions from industrial sectors and were produced in 2014 to incorporate the 2013 World Meteorological Organization data. But given that the average carbon dioxide emissions from the industrial sector has dropped since 2012 and is expected to drop below the 20 million metric tons CO2 equivalent in 2015, the UNEP data can provide a rough baseline on the average total emissions of the industrial sectors.

The most recent global carbon dioxide emissions data for 2013 was released by the World Bank in the spring of 2014. It showed the top five emitters of carbon dioxide (G7), the U.S. (5th), China (5th), Russia (2nd), UK (2nd) and Germany (1st) accounted for 36.3 million metric tons per year. That is 8.6% of global GDP in 2013, or about $1.7 trillion.

However, in 2013, fossil fuel burning emitted 1,066 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent to the CO2 level in the atmosphere. This is more than double from the 564 million metric tons in carbon dioxide equivalent emitted by industrial sectors during 2012 and the 12% increase over 2005 to 2012. And it is not expected to change much between now and 2015.

While the U.S. coal industry is being blamed for the coal-driven climate crisis, coal still accounts for 37% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., and remains the largest emitters of carbon dioxide. The global coal sector is now the second largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world (after the U.S.), according to data from the UNEP.

However, as the fossil fuel industry continues to shrink in both developed and developing counties, coal will continue to be in the lead in emissions and will most likely remain so until 2030.

While the U.S., China and others in the coal sector are moving away from coal, carbon dioxide emissions in Asia, the European Union, the Middle East and Africa are being reduced for the future with carbon dioxide emissions from other sectors (primarily from the oil and gas industry) remaining the same or decreasing.

""We need to prepare for the possible future scenarios,"" UNEP Director-General Achim Steiner said in a release. ""Today, we are on the first step towards understanding the potential changes and their potential impact."
"Former President Barack Obama is taking a page out of former President Richard Nixon's playbook, calling on the nation's law enforcement agencies to ""step up"" and crack down on bogus religious freedom claims that could be used to discriminate against LGBT people.

Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. on Thursday, Obama made an impassioned call for the nation's law enforcement to ""step up"" to protect LGBT Americans from being forced to use the bathroom that doesn't match their gender identity.

""We're not going to stand for discrimination,"" Obama said. ""We're not going to stand for laws that target people because of who they love, who they're attracted to. Now, this is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It is an American issue. And it is a civil rights issue. It is a serious civil rights issue. And it is a gay rights issue.""

The former president added that LGBT people have ""a right to be able to go to the bathroom that they feel is appropriate.""

""And that goes for everybody,"" Obama said. ""And it is not an either-or proposition. It's both an issue of rights and a basic reality that if you don't have access to the full range of services that are available to every other American, you are in part excluding yourself from the full values and ideals of the country.""

Obama further noted that the federal government is already providing resources and guidance to local police in order to prevent discrimination, but urged the country's law enforcement agencies to ""step up"" and do the same.

""We don't want to see folks who are somehow in positions of power or authority use their position to target folks based on who they are, based on their sexual orientation or gender identity,"" Obama said. ""We don't want to see folks who are out and about and walking down the street or driving down the street being harassed, being intimidated, being threatened because of who they are.""

Obama also called on the country's legal community to ""step up"" in order to fight the anti-LGBTQ movement, which he called ""intolerant and hateful.""

""The tone has been set by folks who have been emboldened by this election, this election cycle, to push forward,"" Obama said. ""We can't let that happen. We can't let them send a signal that we're not going to accept them, that we're not going to be proud of who we are, that our children are less than, that our culture is less than.""

The former president also praised the work of the LGBT community and warned that those who want to ""go back to the good old days"" of discrimination are ""ignorant, bigoted, and hateful.""

""Our diversity is our strength and our future. We must not allow anyone who discriminates against any of us to succeed,"" Obama said. ""That includes our law"

Treatment of Domestic Violence

H.B. 2, the Violence Against Women Act, which permits an individual to be held criminally responsible for committing a crime against a person or property that they know is occupied and not currently being used by another person, was promulgated on October 28, 1993.

As a result of the enactment of H.B. 2, California citizens should be aware that their local law enforcement is permitted to arrest and incarcerate those they know to be guilty of domestic violence. Furthermore, the following are additional protections that apply to victims of domestic violence under California law and other states' laws. Please note that while the above text does not contain citations to statutes or citations to cases, it does refer to various cases in this area of law, which may contain additional guidance in that area:

""He's always been a leader and always had a great attitude and worked hard and just as a person, he's awesome. I was talking to him the other day and he said he's going to be a great leader for us.

"The first half of 2012 was a big one for Linux. With the release of Windows 8 and its Metro UX, an unprecedented number of developers were able to port their app's apps to the new interface. It was the end of more than a few hopes of Windows 7 users that these apps would actually port to their OS, too.

The Linux community couldn't stay away from Microsoft as well, however. Even with some Windows 8 apps not working quite as smoothly as others, the community has stuck with the OS. Most, including Ubuntu 12.04, are now using Unity, and as it has become more stable, more are coming to the desktop in hopes of better compatibility with Windows.

Even the developers who have not ported to Windows still hope that they'll eventually be able to port a number of games. One such developer and publisher is Bigpoint, and the company is now launching its game, the space combat game StarDrive, on Linux.

""If someone wants to play games on Linux, they can start with a Unity application or a game in the Steam Store, and get their games up and running on a Linux desktop in their own time,"" says Brad Larsen, director of business development at Bigpoint.

""I hope that people in the commercial end of the development space get excited about Linux because it's not something they have to worry about. I think there has been an amazing amount of innovation in the desktop gaming space and as the industry evolves, everyone wants to support that.""

StarDrive is in Beta

While Unity is a powerful and widely used game engine, the game itself is a lot less polished. It currently only works on Windows RT computers and Linux, as well as Windows PCs using Intel and AMD processors.

The game is in Beta, meaning that developers are still working out bugs and getting to know what's going on. However, Larsen says that Bigpoint is working on making features like multiplayer available as well as other features, like cloud support, making the game better than the current state of the art.

""We're hoping that eventually we can be making more major features available,"" says Larsen. ""StarDrive has a lot of potential and we're hoping that others will find the same thing and want to make their game available,"" he adds, noting that Bigpoint is currently exploring using Unity alongside Bigpoint's own in-house, proprietary technology.

Linux gaming has been growing and the future looks bright for it. While Windows is certainly still the standard for high-end machines, the growing popularity of Linux brings a new platform to the table. As more developers try to take advantage of the fact Linux support has become more widespread, more Steam games will have a chance to make the switch.

Bigpoint is the first to be available with Linux support, though, meaning that developers and players have a fighting chance at getting games onto their systems. We'll of course"
"Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, on Monday called on the Republican presidential candidate to release his tax returns.

""We have made clear that we would like to see his tax returns, now is the time to show them,"" Conway said on Fox News.

Trump has come under fire from Hillary Clinton and her allies for refusing to release his tax returns.

The New York Times reported on Friday that Trump had no $1 million in income in 1995 due to the fact that the Trump Foundation, which he founded in the 1970s, had declared a $1 million loss in 1995.

The IRS code prohibits wealthy individuals and business organizations from deducting charitable contributions from their federal income taxes.

The Times also reported that ""as a result of those losses, the foundation would have been able to make charitable contributions of up to $5 million over the next eight years, but only up to $1 million over the next 16 years.""

The Trump campaign has disputed the Times' account.

In a statement Sunday, Trump said his charity was ""self-funded"" and that he would not release his tax returns ""until that's done.""

""I give to many different charities, including the Veterans Administration, but I would like to give back to our great country as well,"" Trump said.

The Clinton campaign has called for Trump to release his tax returns. Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, said in a campaign appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Trump's refusal to make his tax returns public ""raises more questions than answers.""

On Monday, Kaine said it was ""hypocritical"" for Trump to contest the Times' account and then accuse Clinton of trying to ""steal"" his tax returns.

""It's just a little disingenuous to say, 'Well, I'm not going to release my tax returns until that whole deal is cleared up,'"" Kaine said. ""Why don't we just create the transparency where people can see them.""

"The best parts of being a dog can be found in your daily routine. So how do you ensure that your dog's everyday petting routine, while entertaining and educational, keeps you in the mood at work?

In today's post, I am talking about that magic moment when you walk into your cubicle and your dog is already there. I know many of my clients who love this part of their daily dog training. I also know some people who don't share in their dog's excitement – but neither do I! It is a tough balance, I know, but the answer is to keep your dog's daily routine fun and enjoyable, while not distracting him from the important stuff. And today, I'm going to tell you how to put yourself in that happy place!

So… how do you make your ""dog training day"" a positive learning experience for your dog? I've found it most effective to keep your dog's daily routine as fun and playful as possible, so it's easy to start and stop. This means you will want to start a routine early as usual (and keep this regular throughout the day so that your dog doesn't get bored with your time), you will want a routine that is easy to follow – and you'll want a routine that makes your dog happy. I have a secret weapon that helps with all of the above, and it has to do with the way dogs respond when people are close to them.

You'll likely find, as with most dog training tips, that you are better off to start from home with a little less ""stuff"" and a little more ""fun"". I've found that this makes it easier for my dogs to relax, play and enjoy their time with me. This does not mean that you should always be outside, playing, working or meeting your dog whenever you want. I don't think doing that will make them happy, and I don't think it will keep you happy either. Your job as a dog trainer is to keep your dogs happy (a job I'll get to later), and that is mostly done with fun, exciting and engaging activities.

What is a Good Habit?

I would define a good dog training habit as one that will enhance the learning quality of your dog at work every time! This requires that you have a routine that will help your dog enjoy, learn, and be good at what you are trying to teach him. I have found that this means that you want your dog training day to include a few positive-learning activities that have you walking or running in the park or having a special treat or toy in one hand, while your other hand is gently petting your dog. This is usually followed by playtime.

So What Makes a Good Dog Training Habit?!

The best dog training habits involve walking your dog in your daily routine, and have a lot of fun and excitement elements involved. When we are walking our dogs"
"1. Introduction

1.1. Who is behind this project??

1.2. What is it?

This project is a fork of the official GStreamer implementation from the GNOME project.

It features a more modern version of the code, implemented in Python.

It's the successor of Gst-Wrt and can be used also for all other GStreamer applications.

1.3. What is GStreamer?

GStreamer is the complete multimedia framework for cross-platform software and hardware applications;

Its software was part of X Window System (WAS) from the beginning, and is used on many operating systems;

It's part of the GNOME desktop.

2. GStreamer 2

The new version is a significant evolution because it adds new features and improvements, not least of which is an integrated implementation of a complete audio driver. GStreamer 2 is an open standards compliant library and can be used to build a wide variety audio and video applications. Some examples are audio and video editors, media players, and the GNOME remote desktop. GStreamer 2 has many features which are provided by the more recent versions of GStreamer, even though it is an independent project, e.g. it does not depend on Gst-Plugin for audio processing.

2.1. Supported APIs

GStreamer supports an API of varying depth and complexity. It's easy to build some applications for GStreamer and still remain portable. Here are the known GStreamer 2 APIs that you can use today for multimedia applications:

GstDeviceElement

GstStreamBufferElement

GstAudioChannel

GstVideoChrome

GstVideoDecoder

There is a proposal for a new, more powerful, API, GstDeviceElement and you can explore the code.

2.2. Requirements and Platforms

The new API is currently only available for Linux, but it depends only on GStreamer 2. A version of Gst-Plugin for this API is planned for GStreamer 3. GStreamer 3.0 or later is mandatory.

2.2.1. On Windows

Currently you need the 32 bit version of GStreamer. The 32 bit version is the default on Windows so that both your system and your application will be able to run in 32 bit mode.

It's always recommended to use the Gst-Plugin library in your application to avoid issues if you can't. You can always fall back using plain GStreamer. If you would like to have access to the plugin API Gst-Plugin will not be able to provide you access to any of the features like hardware decoding or hardware acceleration.

On GNU/Linux you can download the Gst-Plugin source from the sources.gnome.org FTP server: ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GN"
"What are the best tools for navigating the data and business processes of a Business Intelligence (BI) environment?

I have been using some of the same tools and techniques for months now and I am still learning as I go along. But a few of them have been very useful to me personally, so I thought I'd share.

Partly these are just tools I like to use, but they also give me a little insight into how I approach BI and what I find useful.

What are the best tools for navigating the data and business processes of a Business Intelligence (BI) environment?

How to use these tools

1. Dashboard

The dashboard is the heart of any BI environment. It's an interface to all the data and business processes in your system. It's not a part of the BI tool itself. It's a representation of the data, and it's the way you interact with the data. Within the dashboard you can navigate through your data and look for relationships and information that makes sense in your organization.

What's important about the dashboard is the structure of the data. It's made up of folders that are part of the data. They can be used to display data, and each folder can have a different set of data that it can display. You can sort the data in the folders by level of granularity (total, by date, etc.). You can use the data to select columns to display on the dashboard. You can use the structure of the data to filter and sort the data. You can also change the order of the columns on the dashboard.

The dashboard also allows you to create tables that represent the data and show the relationship between the tables. You can create tables that represent the data and show the relationship between the tables. You can create tables that represent the data and show the relationship between the tables.

This is the most important thing about the dashboard – it allows you to store, organize and manage your work.

2. Query Builder

Query Builder is a BI tool that helps you create query plans. It also lets you create and execute queries. You can use Query Builder to create queries that are specific to a business unit. You can also use it to create queries that are general and can apply to a wide range of business units. You can also use Query Builder to create queries that are general and can apply to a wide range of business units.

"The ""Big Five"" of personality traits, as described by Myers and Briggs, have a significant contribution to the way people think and respond: Extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability, openness, and conscientiousness. But the most interesting aspect of the Big Five is its lack of a middle group trait, the introvert/extrovert dichotomy. For years, personality researchers and even most psychologists felt that extraversion must be the dominant trait, and that extraverted people were more mature, conscientious, and emotionally stable than introverted ones. But while introverts and extroverts are very similar at certain developmental stages, introverts are not simply stronger than extroverts, nor are they just ""different types."" They appear to have their own unique characteristics and preferences.

One of the most common arguments against the extrovert/introvert dichotomy is that extraversion is a better predictor of adult life outcomes, while extraversion was not important in early childhood. Extraversion is said to be the most stable trait in childhood, and this may be true – extraverted children tend to be highly successful as adults. For example, the Extraversion-Introversion Inventory (EI-I), a measure of adult Extraversion and the Big Five traits, revealed that extraversion has a mean value of 9.4 on a 4-point scale, while introversion has a mean value of 9.7. Similarly, in a study of 1,637 married couples, EI-I scores of extraverts were on average 7.85, while scores of introverts were on average 7.87. Likewise, for conscientiousness and agreeableness, EI-I scores of extraverts were on average 2.92 and 2.69, while scores of introverts were on average 2.86.

However, according to one of the researchers who performed this research, Carl Jung, and her colleagues, we need to consider more than just the level of introversion. Extroverts and introverts are not only different in different stages on the personality spectrum; the extrovert/introvert dichotomy can apply to many of the same types. In fact, Jung and his colleagues found that there are five traits with the greatest overlap between introverts and extraverts – those of the Big Five.

So before you dismiss the idea of a ""Big Five of Personality Types"" or claim that extraversion is all you need to be a successful and psychologically healthy individual, take a moment to look at the five traits for introverts and see whether you are an extrovert or a introvert. Then think about whether you would agree with Jung and her colleagues that these five traits can be found in introverts and extroverts alike.

"Gift of the Givers

I'm always on the lookout for new and inspiring things. When I was in high school, I attended an event with the Reverend Bob Riley, who was then pastor of the St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in downtown Denver. My family had moved from New York City to Denver in search of the Rockies back then. During the day, we were driving from city to city, visiting museums and parks. On Saturday, we were in Denver celebrating Independence Day. I had come with my family to see the statue of George Washington, which sits in front of the Denver City Market, and a bronze plaque on top honors our family's long journey to this city. One of our church members, a couple of weeks later, was giving the young man his first communion, a gift of ""tongue-in-cheek"" recognition for his dedication.

The couple asked for forgiveness for letting the young man, who is homosexual, think this was a joke. I wanted to tell them it was not a joke. To me it was a celebration. We had made it here, and the day had been a success.

I have heard a lot of people in my family say, ""Why are we here?"" I am still here, and I'm going to see my friends, and maybe even do something with my life. But I also want to be here. This church is, without doubt, my family. It's the place where I feel most at home and most loved. If that's not a place of welcome, something is very, very wrong.

But I am not here only because I live here. Our faith is not a static thing. Our churches evolve. They grow. But we can also remain rooted if we remember to be generous, if we remember to celebrate where we are, and give encouragement to those we come across. I am here because the gift has come to me. There is no better gift, because it will never leave me.

Thank you."
"The first day was tough. My head was full of confusion and a few bouts of dizziness, and after that, it was just normal walking. As I walked, I saw every single person and every single sign there was to see. Some people stopped to pick up their loved ones; others just enjoyed the view. It was absolutely beautiful, both in and out of the city. Then I encountered the police, and the panic began.

I remember the first time the police officer tried to grab me, I felt fear come rushing back through my body. I was thinking, I don't know why this cop thinks he has the right to stop me. As my thoughts raced, I was trying very hard to find the right words to explain to him why I didn't want him touching me. I knew what it was like to be on the other side of a police encounter, just like he and his partner were going through. This was very intimidating and I felt the emotions as fast as I could. As he was attempting to reach me, I let go of the front of my jacket and I made it out of my seat and onto the sidewalk.

I had to do it.

With his hands still gripping my back, the officer began to turn me around, and his partner approached the passenger side. They turned on the sirens, yelled a few commands, and then they turned on their lights and sped off.

I was in shock. I tried to calm myself, but the adrenaline was back. I couldn't control myself anymore, and I began to yell out my window. The police pulled me over, searched my bag, and informed me that I was speeding when I was going 35 mph in a 25 mph zone. The officer asked me if I had a license and insurance. I told him that I did, and then I proceeded to tell him I don't have a license because I was a journalist covering the inauguration. I asked him how I was going to pay for this ticket and if he would put an insurance policy on my car. The officer told me I didn't have a car, and I told him that it didn't matter, at least it didn't cost me my job. He said just pay the ticket, and that would be that. I had no money then, but I wasn't giving up. The officer told me again that the car is a rental, and I told him that there's nothing he can do here. I pointed out that I was covering the president, and I still had my press credentials from the convention.

The cop's partner looked at me with anger on his face. He tried to open his door by pulling on the seat belt, and he grabbed my arm as I began to yell. I threw my bag over his arm, and I told him that I did not know where the rental was, but I'd drive to the address on my phone and look for it. He"

Amman — The Lebanese flag was raised Monday at a ceremony marking 25 years since a failed assassination attempt against President Michel Suleiman, the most recent in a string of events that have brought the country to a precipice.

The assassination attempt on May 15, 1992, killed Suleiman's cousin and close confidant, Major-General Abdel Rahman Sayyed Hariri.

The killing left him and President Elias Jumaa, who had become president the previous year, deeply divided over the future of the fledgling democracy.

Suleiman, 88, was hospitalized last week with chest pains after traveling to his official residence in the capital at the height of the mourning. He remained hospitalized in his hometown of Beirut on Monday night.

Presidential spokesperson Hassan Khalil said the president suffered chest pains after returning from a military hospital in Jordan. He had also undergone heart surgery earlier this year.

Suleiman was treated at the Princess Rashed hospital in Amman earlier this month for a deep vein thrombosis. He was discharged and had undergone radiation treatment.

The presidential palace, where Soussan's daughter Azza Suleiman attended the funeral, was evacuated, but the body was taken to the presidential hospital.

In a speech Monday, Khalil said that Suleiman was ""sorely bothered"" by the events of that morning. He added that all the government's efforts were to help Suleiman.

The president expressed regret over his illness, telling a group of diplomats: ""I am weak, I cannot fight this disease anymore.""

During his presidential career, Suleiman headed the country's armed forces and, later, the presidential guard in Lebanon and served as defense minister.

In the 1980s and '90s, Hezbollah battled the forces of Lebanon's arch-foe Israel over southern Lebanon, often using Suleiman's support for the Sunni Muslim group.

Suleiman made the suicide attack on Hariri after an apparent row erupted over a Syrian missile deal that Israel refused to accept. He ordered his forces to bombard Syria from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea in response, forcing the Israeli military to withdraw.

A similar attack on Jumaa on May 15, 1992, ended the president's premiership days before he reached the 10-year mark in office.

The assassination was an attempt on Suleiman's life but the main suspects were later killed in a joint Lebanese-Jordanian police raid.

In a statement released through his official website, Suleiman said: ""It is clear that our society has survived a lot and it has survived many"

"Pistol-packing, tie-dyed political neophyte David Koch is taking his influence to the state's highest court, setting up an unlikely showdown with the state's Democratic governor and putting the spotlight on Texas' unruly politics.

The billionaire Koch brothers' political network is planning to spend at least $900,000 in its first-ever advertising buy in the Texas Supreme Court race, according to a person familiar with the plan.

The ad buy comes a week after a similar spending spree in the state's U.S. Senate race, which has already been the subject of a Republican-led investigation by the Federal Election Commission.

It is not clear whether the Koch brothers are contributing directly to the Texas Supreme Court race, although they are believed to be responsible for the Texas Senate race.

Koch has been in the headlines recently because his political action committee, Americans for Prosperity (AFP), is spending $1.6 million to support Republican gubernatorial nominee Greg Abbott. Abbott was appointed by Gov. Rick Perry, who is embroiled in an impeachment battle in the Texas House over accusations of abuse of power.

The billionaire Koch brothers' political action committee, Americans for Prosperity (AFP), is spending $1.6 million to support Republican gubernatorial nominee Greg Abbott.

The AFP ad campaign has been criticized for running ads that attack Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, accusing her of wanting to ""end abortion"" and ""put Texans back in chains.""

The ads also accuse Davis and Abbott of wanting to ""end the separation of church and state"" and to ""take away your freedoms.""

Governor Rick Perry, who is also the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is being investigated by the U.S. House of Representatives after it emerged he had vetoed funding to a women's health clinic in his state.

The governor is also being investigated by the U.S. House of Representatives after it emerged he had vetoed funding to a women's health clinic in his state.

AFP has released three ads attacking Abbott, but a spokesman for the group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The group's first ad, released on March 10, attacks Abbott for supporting a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, arguing it ""would restrict the fundamental rights of our children"" and ""would make Texas less and less like the rest of the country.""

The ad, titled ""Pro-Abortion,"" was first reported by the Texas Tribune.

The ad was a response to a separate AFP ad, released on March 9, that attacked Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis for wanting to ""end abortion.""

AFP's latest ad was released on March 3, calling on voters to ""Reject the radicals who would take away our guns. Make Abbott the governor who keeps our guns.""

The third ad, released on March 3, attacked Democratic gubernatorial candidate Davis for wanting to ""end"

"Pilot's Helmet

A pilot should always wear his own helmet on the aircraft with him at all times, regardless whether it's at his home, his office, or his place of business.

If the pilot has to leave his home without his helmet, the manufacturer may require the pilot to provide a spare, as most aircraft manufacturers require pilots to have their own set of tools, etc, in their own sets for maintenance. So, it's a good idea to wear your helmet while out of your home.

You need to be aware that you can get caught stealing aircraft tools from your home or office if you leave them unattended without a helmet. When you come to realize you have left them there and someone steals them, you will likely be prosecuted for theft of aircraft tools.

Some manufacturers require you to wear their helmets when you operate helicopters so that you don't forget your helmet when operating helicopters."
"A federal court on Friday ordered the FBI to turn over more than two years worth of records on the bureau's use of a controversial surveillance technique known as stingray, which can sweep up communications on cellphones in a broad area and can simulate a cellphone tower in order to trick phones into revealing their locations.

Though the order was a preliminary one addressing the case of a man named Larry Klayman, who was arrested while he was looking at a gun at a federal courthouse, it is likely to set a precedent for many other cases in which the FBI has used the technology in a manner that is at odds with the Fourth Amendment.

""It's just another example of the FBI's overreach,"" Klayman said in a statement. ""We're looking forward to getting the records, and we're also looking forward to ensuring that this doesn't happen to anyone else.""

[FBI has made more than 1,000 requests for cell site simulators since 2011]

Klayman, a conservative activist who has led recent efforts to expose government waste and fraud, brought a lawsuit against the FBI in 2013 after he was arrested at a gun range in suburban Washington and questioned about his gun. Authorities later discovered a stingray in his car.

""I was shocked, I was shocked,"" Klayman, who is representing himself in the case, said Friday at a news conference. ""I was stunned by the use of the technology, and stunned by the way that the FBI was using the technology in a manner that was contrary to the Fourth Amendment.""

In the lawsuit, Klayman alleged that the FBI violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

The FBI has argued that it is not required to turn over the records because the law applies only to criminal investigations.

""The FBI is pleased that the court has ordered the release of information related to stingrays,"" an FBI spokesman said in a statement Friday. ""After reviewing the court's order, we are confident that it is in the public interest to release information regarding this program.""

The case of Klayman, who has filed similar lawsuits in state and federal courts across the country, highlights the issues with the use of stingray devices, which are typically used by federal and local law enforcement to track suspects or locate stolen phones and other devices. They are also sometimes used by private parties.

[Federal judge orders FBI to search stingray records]

The FBI began using its devices in the mid-2000s to track cellphones, but the use of stingray technology has been accelerated by a growing number of police agencies nationwide, the Washington Post reported in a 2013 story.

Since the Post story, the FBI has made more than 1,000 requests to local and state law enforcement agencies for stingray devices, according to records obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a"
"As part of a growing movement to fight climate change, a group of scientists in the UK, France, and other countries has set up an ""International Climate Protection Partnership"". The organization wants to use the coming decade to develop the science and strategy to ensure that fossil fuels are phased out and the world achieves its climate goals in the long-term.

The first meeting of the coalition, which aims to generate the necessary political and policy momentum for a transition to renewable energy and a clean energy economy, took place today and will be followed by three days of workshops, conferences, and round tables.

The international group brings together scientists and experts from across the world to develop a shared vision for how our planet can achieve its climate goals and build a stable and safe future for our families, our ecosystems, and future generations.

The group is led by climate scientist Professor David Karoly, of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London (see an interview with Professor Karoly below). He explained to Carbon Brief: ""We need to find a way of acting now, in the mid- to long-term, in order to achieve the kind of climate change that we want to see - and that is something that can also work in the short-term.""

In April, Karoly presented a report on the global progress towards achieving the UN's Paris Agreement targets on climate change, which states, ""To limit global temperature rise to 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels and keep it below 2 °C, global warming must be limited to the maximum rate consistent with a safe and orderly society and with a sustainable world economy.""

The report provides a roadmap for the necessary changes, some of which have already been made. ""We know that if we had to act now we could do so - the task is now to make sure that this happens. This could include a number of policy actions, for example by taking action to reduce emissions from the transportation sector, such as by providing tax incentives to encourage a shift from vehicles to less polluting forms of transport,"" Professor Karoly told the briefing.

In a joint statement, scientists from the group highlighted the need for greater support for developing countries' efforts to develop new sources of low-carbon energy.

More than a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions now come from developing countries, and according to a 2013 report from the World Bank, this share will rise from 21% in 2020 to 35% by 2040. To meet the pledges made in Paris, ""there is a strong moral obligation and a political opportunity to help these countries become fully resilient,"" said the scientists.

Professor Karoly's conference is taking place at the University of Manchester to the UK and the French national science centers at Bordeaux and Lille, and at the National Institutes of Health in Washington DC.

""It will be the first global conference focused on addressing climate change so people can share ideas and"

"Knowledge of the defendant's criminal history is a consideration in the sentencing of a defendant. A defendant who is found guilty of a crime is presumed to have a criminal history (by statute) indicating that he or she is a danger to the community. This presumption of a criminal history exists even if the defendant has never been convicted of a crime.


Several factors are considered to determine whether a defendant's criminal history is relevant or not. These factors include:


Whether the defendant has been convicted of a crime.

Whether the defendant has committed the crime that led to the conviction.

Whether the defendant is currently in custody, and

Whether the defendant is currently under supervision.


All of the factors that are necessary to determine whether a defendant has a criminal history will be discussed below.


1. Whether the Defendant Has Been Convicted of a Crime


To prove that a defendant has a criminal history, the State must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant has been convicted of a crime.


2. Whether the Defendant Has Committed the Crime that Led to the Conviction


The State must prove that the defendant committed the crime that led to the defendant's criminal history. This is called the ""offense"" that led to the conviction.


Example: The defendant is convicted of third-degree rape after being convicted of first-degree rape. The State must prove that the defendant committed the crime that led to the conviction.


3. Whether the Defendant is Currently in Custody or Under Supervision


The State must prove that the defendant is currently in custody and under supervision.


Example: The defendant is in jail awaiting sentencing and is under supervision for a previous rape conviction. To prove that the defendant has a criminal history, the State must prove that the defendant has committed a crime that led to the conviction.


4. Whether the Defendant Is Currently Under Supervision


The State must prove that the defendant is currently under supervision for a crime.


Example: The defendant has been sentenced to three years in jail. The State must prove that the defendant is currently under supervision for a crime.


5. The Defendant's Prior Convictions and the Sentence He or She Received


To prove that a defendant has a criminal history, the State must prove that the defendant has a history of prior convictions, and that these convictions were of a crime that led to the defendant's criminal history.


Example: The defendant was convicted of three counts of first-degree rape. The State must prove that the defendant has a criminal history.


6. The Nature and Length of the Defendant's Criminal History


The length of a defendant's criminal history is irrelevant to the determination whether the defendant would be a danger to the community.


Example: The defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery. The State must prove that the defendant has a criminal history"

Snapchat is said to be testing a new feature that allows users to pay for in-app purchases.

The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times report that the feature will only be available in a small amount of locations, including a few U.S. cities, beginning in the next few weeks.

The Journal says Snapchat will test the new feature in the New York City subway system, with the Times saying the company will test it in London.

Snapchat is one of the hottest social apps right now, as its founders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, have gone on to found Instagram.

The Journal says its testing will allow users to pay for things in-app using ""tap-to-pay"" technology that allows users to simply tap their screen when they want to make a purchase.

The Times says it's not clear exactly how Snapchat will make money from the feature, and it could be another way to monetize the app.

"It's not yet another story about your friend who used to look pretty, then got fat. Or a blog about how you're about to be the worst thing to ever happen to your boyfriend. But it's not an easy journey either. And that's why you need to understand the process by which being fat and unhappy ends up as a lifelong challenge for many women.

""Women have long been the primary victims of societal fat shaming, the idea being that we don't know how to work out – that we're not worthy of love because of our weight,"" says Emma, a fat-acceptance advocate. ""For women who are constantly being told that you shouldn't love your fat body, the only options are to eat well and lose weight, or to lose weight and not eat. And that's a pretty good recipe for a long, unhappy life.""

The good news for Emma and other fat adults – plus the lucky – is that with more and more people willing to accept themselves as fat, they'll finally be able to stop blaming their experiences of weight on society and on themselves. ""As fat people, we've known for a long time that our fatness exists within a social context – often without us even really noticing any differences,"" says Emma. ""The more and more people become aware of this, and the more of a shift in weight-based social judgment we can see, the better off we'll be.""

So if your friends are giving you a hard time, or telling you that you shouldn't love your fat body – don't be afraid to stop them. Because even if fat shaming and its long-term repercussions are still hard for some people to acknowledge – and even if many adults are still making assumptions that are harmful – there's no denying that the good news of the year is that more and more people are seeing their fat bodies as valuable. And that, right now, is something the fat community can be very proud of."

"What happens if a man dies and no one has to pay for his funeral, but a woman does? How is the funeral handled if it is in public?

The issue of women receiving the same treatment as a man when it comes to death came up recently in Canada as a Supreme Court ruling on a family's right to be listed on a death certificate as the deceased was being appealed. When a dispute arose over the gender of the victim, the court agreed that this should not affect the family's right to have his or her body laid to rest and to make that happen at a religious funeral home in their community.

While the Supreme Court seems to be taking away some of the rights of the deceased to choose the funeral home and burial plot that best represent his or her wishes, these decisions are usually made by grieving families in consultation with a trained counselor.

Why women receive funeral duties that men do not

While many would agree that women and men should receive equal services in terms of funeral services, it can still come as a shock or disappointment to learn that the funeral house will often be able to offer more to the woman with the same size coffin that she would need to hold to ensure a smooth, secure burial. For example:

The coffin or shrouds the deceased will be buried in, are typically made of wood with the deceased in it

The casket is made of wood, and it is made to look like a real coffin

The embalming equipment used to preserve the body after death is actually for men and not women

Cremation, which is used to preserve the body after death after it is removed from the body of the deceased, is a process that women do not typically go through, and this fact is not hidden

The burial may be casketed with a man, but the coffin is actually made for women and not for men

If there is more than one coffin or burial set, there is more space for men to be in than women (thus, the additional space is allocated to men and not women to reduce the waste of money)

Why women may have to put on heavier clothing and jewelry to represent themselves

Women often need more clothing items/jewels to represent them when they don funerals, as they are typically taking on the role of being mourners instead of taking the place of the deceased. When these factors are taken into account, the average cost of a woman's funeral could be more than the average cost for a man's funeral.

Why cremation may not be for women

In the United States, women have had the right to give up their loved ones to a funeral home as long as their relationship with the deceased was known at the time. However, in 2009, the United Nations declared that no funeral home should remove the remains from the earth unless the body's identity is confirmed and the family knows that they can afford the funeral ("

""I was in the corner working and I heard a single shot, and the second shot was a round,"" said resident Todd Fonseca.


Fonseca says he ran to the scene and saw the victim lying on the ground, with blood all over her head.


""I saw the blood on her head, her shirt, and I thought 'oh my God, is that really her?'"" said Fonseca. ""Then I saw her hat lying on the ground.""


Police say the victim was shot by her boyfriend, identified as 27-year-old Matthew Benson.


Police say Benson told officers he went to the bar to confront his girlfriend after she left him two months ago.


""She was yelling at him and he was yelling back at her and then she pushed him and he shot her,"" said Fonseca.


Benson was arrested and charged with domestic violence third degree assault.


Police say he is also being treated for a gunshot wound to the hand.


The victim's friend, who identified himself as Kaitlyn Graham, says Benson may have produced a gun. He says he believes the victim's life was in danger.


""He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He had no intention of ever hurting her,"" said Graham. ""He just wanted to talk to her. He was just being a good boyfriend. I don't know what happened. It's like, it's broken my heart.""


The victim's friend says her life is now in danger in the community.


""I'm just extremely worried about my friend, because she depends on me,"" said Graham.


Two witnesses who did not wish to be identified say a woman leaving the bar followed Benson to his car.


""She was screaming, 'he shot my friend, he shot my friend,'"" said one witness.


The two witnesses say the woman was shot in the back.


""I think that's what changed the guy's mind. He said, 'I didn't know he was going to do that.' He was on his phone,"" said the witness.


Benson remains in jail on a $500,000 bond. In the meantime, the woman is stable in the ICU."

"PURPOSE:

To compare the effects of a novel, oral, high-risk, low-carbohydrate diet and a low saturated fat, high-fiber diet on fasting lipid profile, nonfasting lipid profile, lipoprotein cholesterol (Lp(a), and apo(a)) concentration, LDL-C (LDL-C(a)) and apolipoprotein (apo(a))-I levels in children and adolescents with elevated blood lipids.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS:

Sixteen overweight/obese children/adolescents with abnormal lipid profiles as determined by carotid ultrasound-based quantitative lipoprotein analysis, and 16 age- and gender-matched, sedentary healthy controls were enrolled in the study, which began after informed written consent had been obtained from all the adults. Subjects underwent a minimum 24-h fast. After an overnight fast, subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 experimental diets: a high-risk, low-fiber diet (HP+LDL-C(a)). One subject on the HP diet was switched because of changes in mood and to a second subject (HP+LDL-C(a)) because of changes in triglyceride levels when the subjects were on the diet. The experimental diets were very low-carbohydrate and followed a Mediterranean-style diet containing about 70% of energy from proteins, 20% from fats, and 20% from carbohydrates.

RESULTS:

Plasma LDL-C levels significantly increased (p < 0.01 in both groups at 48 h) after consumption of the HP+LDL-C(a) diet for the first 6 weeks (P < 0.02), and stayed elevated for all subsequent 2 weeks (P < 0.005 vs. the placebo group) regardless of sex or age. During the initial 5 weeks, plasma triglyceride levels were also increased (P < 0.02) after consumption of the HP diet. After the first 6 weeks on the HP diet, apo(a) remained unaffected in either group, but a tendency for significant increase was observed (P = 0.03); after the initial 6 weeks on the HP diet, HDL-C levels were increased (P < 0.02) in both groups (P = 0.09 in HG+LDL-C(a) vs. the placebo group), and then remained elevated through the next 2 weeks (P < 0.005); no further changes were found by the end of the study.

CONCLUSION:

In children and adolescents with normal HDL-C levels and elevated LDL-C concentrations, a high-risk, low-fiber low-carbohydrate diet resulted in a worsening of LDL-C, but not triglycerides or apo(a); but a Mediterranean-style high protein, low fat dietary pattern resulted in a stabilization of HDL-C and ap"
"A recent report published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has found that the vast majority of immigrant households, including those with children, are better off financially than the native-born population, and that immigrants are more likely to own a home than native-born Americans.

According to HUD, those who are not legal residents are the second most financially disadvantaged group, with a median income of just $28,000. However, immigrants are no less likely to own a home than native-born Americans, and the number of immigrants who own a home is higher than half of the native-born households.

The report also found that while economic security is a major factor in the decision to move to a new country, many immigrants return to their home countries after they've arrived, in hopes of finding a better job, a better lifestyle, and even a better standard of living.

""When immigrants arrive in a new country, the process of naturalization often begins with the finding of a job,"" the report reads. ""However, it is clear that many immigrants, especially those from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, are unable to find work in their first country or countries. For example, in the United States, a full quarter of foreign born are working in the unauthorized or illegal work force.""

While the report notes that most Latin American and Asian immigrants are able to find work, it also notes that ""a number of these workers are unable to find a job, despite having been in the country for a long time.""

The report also found that many immigrant women are leaving the labor force to take care of their children and would be better off returning to work.

A full 38 percent of immigrant women between the ages of 15 and 44 are working compared to 17 percent of native-born American women, a gap that widens to 43 percent for immigrant men and 27 percent among native-born men.

The report also found that immigrants are more likely to be in the workforce than natives, even though they may not have the same skills and education.

""The percentage of immigrants who hold a job is slightly higher than for natives, an indication that immigrants tend to have higher levels of education than natives,"" the report reads. ""For example, immigrants are more likely to hold jobs in'management, business, science, and arts, and related fields' than natives. However, the study also shows that natives are more likely to hold these jobs.""

The report also found that immigrants are also more likely to stay in their jobs longer than natives. Just under half of immigrant men and women are employed for a year or more compared to just over a quarter of natives.

The report found that more than 60 percent of immigrant women between the ages of 20 and 64, compared to just over 40 percent of native women, were employed at some point in the year.

Excellent, quality I like this so much I want to buy more. I bought 2 of these with extra buttons. No trouble fitting them. I bought 2 of these with extra buttons. No trouble fitting them. One of these for my daughter and one for my wife. They use them with all of our different knives.

Fits to order I had 2 issues with some buttons that were loose on one of them. I contacted customer service for assistance and was contacted by a rep on Jan 2 at 2:16 pm. The rep called to set up a date to reorder one for me, to which I responded. I received a prompt email response 3 days later that there were no more free buttons for the time being. I had to reorder an additional set of 7. No other issues with these.


Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.

"Just to ensure that you and everyone else know that this was not a staged stunt, I've added the original video below.

Over the weekend, a YouTube user uploaded a clip titled ""New York City subway attacker directed at a cop."" In the clip, a man is seen repeatedly yelling ""Allahu Akbar!"" and waving a knife toward a uniformed police officer on a Manhattan subway platform.

The clip quickly went viral, and it went viral because, as it turns out, the video has been entirely staged.

According to the NYPD, the video was filmed at 12:06 a.m. Sunday morning at the 34th Street-Broadway station in Manhattan. The police were responding to reports of a man who was stabbing people on the platform.

As the video begins, the man in the video tries to get away from the police, yelling ""Allahu Akbar!"" Several times, he yells ""Allahu Akbar!"" as he runs away.

When the man spots a uniformed police officer and turns toward him, he shouts ""You call that a knife?"" The officer then grabs the man, and the man yells ""No, no! You're the one who stabbed me!""

The officer then arrests the man.

By Monday morning, the video had been viewed more than 2 million times.

The NYPD was unable to identify the person in the video as the ""man who attacked people in the subway."" The NYPD declined to comment further when reached by Breitbart News."
"A new method of generating high-quality, flexible polymers with an unlimited number of molecular bonds has been developed; the new method of polymerization involves the use of a complex of DNA polymerases called the ribonucleases. The new method was recently reported in a paper in the journal ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering. It will be an important step in the development of new materials that can be made in scalable manufacturing methods.

Polymers are widely used to make consumer goods such as food and pharmaceuticals, as well as in structural and structural composites. The ability to rapidly and easily produce these materials from a wide variety of start materials and in large quantities has enabled modern industries to benefit from the benefits of rapid technological development. Such innovative polymers can provide increased structural and mechanical strength, reduced weight, increased resistance to environmental degradation, and other desirable qualities.

These new polymer synthesis methods typically involve an enormous number of reactions that are often limited by the rate and degree of polymerization by a complex of enzymes that can be costly, or even impossible to control on a large scale. To generate a wide variety of polymers with high levels of strength at a reasonable cost, engineers have developed so-called ""self-healing"" polymerization methods that increase polymerization rates by a combination of a slow polymerization step and an ""emergency-like"" reaction catalyzed by molecular recognition of environmental or mechanical stimuli.

Most self-healing polymerization techniques thus require high levels of polymerization by enzyme-linked reaction catalysts. But the ""self-healing"" polymerization reaction has one major drawback: it does not allow the polymerization of large polymers. One solution to this problem has been to develop new ""extension"" polymerizations that do not require the expensive addition of catalysts.

A new polymer synthesis method has been developed on the basis of genetic engineering of polymerization. Instead of a complex of enzymes (ribonucleases), this new polymer synthesis method, called a ""dual ribonuclease polymerase system"" (DRPS) allows the use of a large number of enzymes in the polymer synthesis reaction because the systems are designed to have a similar set of properties.

This new method for creating high-quality, multifunctional polymers can be used to make many different polymer materials such as flexible, stretchable, stretchable and rigid polymeric materials that are useful in structural, medical, bio-informatics, and other fields of research. The DRPS system was recently reported in a paper in the journal ACS Polymer Chemistry.

The most important feature of the DRPS system is that it allows the polymerization of a large number of complex monomers into a large number of polymeric materials at low rates of polymerization. This polymerization can be used to synthesize a large number of polymers with highly multifunctional properties.

"The July 2015 issue of Shogakukan's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine is announcing on Tuesday that Shiina Sato's The Visions of Escaflowne ( Escaflowne ) manga will get a television anime adaptation. The series will premiere on the Tokyo MX, BS11, and AT-X channels in October.

The story of the manga centers on the adventures of the Nine Riders, a group of young boys who all possess supernatural powers. The series follows the adventures of the nine riders as they train to become the best ""Visions"" in the world.

The manga won an ""Anime Grand Prix"" in Japan in 2010. The series is also inspiring a stage play, which will run from October 5-16 at the Tokyo International Forum Hall.


Sato launched the manga in Shogakukan's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine in 2011, and Shogakukan published the 16th compiled book volume in Japan on June 27. The manga inspired two television anime adaptations and two original video anime ( OVA ) projects, and the 13th and 14th manga volumes bundled an anime episode. Funimation released both the television anime and the OVA in North America, and it describes the story:

When the world is plunged into war, a boy named Escaflowne is left behind, leading a group of young men with amazing powers. The children must stop a monstrous demon from destroying the world — with the help of the goddesses, Gibusu and Merodoch, and the legendary ""Visions of Escaflowne"" — but things are about to get much, much worse. And as the events of the war prepare to unfold, the boys will learn that their greatest enemy may not be the demon, but each other.

Sato launched the original Escaflowne manga in Shogakukan's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine in 2010, and Shogakukan published the 16th compiled book volume in Japan in November 2014. Kodansha published the 15th and 16th volumes of the manga in English last year.

"In 2011, the San Francisco 49ers made their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance. The team was coming off two consecutive NFC Championship Games, and they had just drafted Colin Kaepernick out of Nevada. He was the biggest quarterback prospect since Manning. So, naturally, the 49ers front office wanted to get him ready.

On December 23, 2011, after a few weeks of preparation and with the team back on his turf in Santa Clara, Kaepernick was traded to the St. Louis Rams. The 49ers lost in the NFC Championship Game as well.

It was time for the 49ers to find a QB.

There was just one problem. There wasn't one.

On Christmas Eve, 2011, Colin Kaepernick signed with the Green Bay Packers for four years $41 million, which included a $12 million signing bonus. While it looked like a crazy deal, he was still coming off two seasons of throwing only 28 touchdowns in 43 starts. The Packers already had Aaron Rodgers at the helm, and the 49ers had never had a QB under contract with the caliber of Kaepernick.

So, the only thing the Packers had to do was find a starter.

That's exactly how it turned out.

Before the 2012 season, the Packers brought in Christian Ponder before the 2012 NFL Draft. However, they released him by the start of training camp, and the rest of the competition was a non-starter with Jim Harbaugh leading the ""Shark Tank.""

Meanwhile, Kaepernick didn't quite fall off the 49ers' radar. The offseason began with the team keeping him at home to work out and be ""cultured"" with his new teammates.

In the preseason, Kaepernick had no issues in leading the 49ers to a 17–3 loss over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 1. He led the team to a 13–3 victory over the Chicago Bears the next week, capped off by a 30-point performance in a 24–3 win over the New York Giants.

He's never had a losing year in his career. While some might have questioned his durability, he didn't let on that he wasn't worried about that. In fact, as far as he was concerned, if the Packers let the Vikings get one last pass at him, he'd be ready for the playoffs.

While Ponder performed better than advertised in 2011, he wasn't ready to replace one of the better quarterbacks in the NFL. It is safe to say that both teams had better players than Kaepernick in 2012.

On November 20, the 49ers were back home for their 2012 finale, and Kaepernick led the team on one of his signature drives to open the game. Kaepernick was 10-of-15 for 133 yards, and added an interception to his stat line at 1:34 of the second quarter. The drive ended on what would become Kaepernick's touchdown in the first half.

Kaepernick would play the rest"
"Prostitution is legal in most countries in the world. However, it is illegal in many countries, including Australia, Canada and the United States of America.

Prostitution does not make money for its users. Rather, it is a sex trade. The money that the sex trade makes is often not enough to pay off debts, and the sex trade itself is often unsafe.

Prostitution is often portrayed as a victimless crime. However, women who sell sex are often victims of violence and rape. Women who sell sex are also often victims of gender-based violence. These women and girls, who are often forced into the sex trade, are often subjected to trafficking and sexual abuse.

"I'm using the new Unity 5 stuff which requires your old stuff too, and I am pretty confused about it.

When starting the game the character just keeps running into walls. I understand that you can use a script to prevent it, but that doesn't solve the problem at all; in my game no-one's died (which I suspect might be because I play with my controller, or my TV or something), and I haven't even tried to put a barrier between me and the game.

So can someone help me make it stop?"
"How can a man not fall for such a blatant lie? Well, most people are not so naive. This is not about what the government tells us about a war in Vietnam or about the CIA or anything else. It is our fault that we live in an age of lies.

This is about propaganda and advertising, how a lot of things have been manipulated to a point where we now take them for granted.

For instance, it used to be that ""the public"" bought products. Maybe a bit later, the ""public"" paid for things. Eventually, government subsidized things too. They were free, and that was pretty cool for most people. And then, after the 1960s, things changed. People realized it wasn't really ""free,"" and that it cost money. When that happened, ""the public"" started demanding government to take care of the ""need"" to afford the ""good things.""

And then ""the public"" got angry when the government was no longer ""doing their part."" Now we all know that ""the government"" can't fix everything, so why should we trust them to make any better decisions?

But that doesn't mean government can't control things. The way we do things now is just one way governments do things.

The only way governments ""make better decisions"" is to ""pay people to make them""

It is not the ""public"" making these decisions. That process is called ""marketplace."" This is more or less how a lot of industries, like airlines, hotels, pharmaceuticals, and so on are created. You hire the top people in those industries, and they offer their services for a lot of extra money. You can then decide if they are good people or not. So the more valuable they are, the higher their pay. And the more money you buy, the faster they can do it.

In other words, they are paid to make things better, and in exchange you get access to ""value"" that has been previously inaccessible to you. I'm not saying they make those decisions, or pay for those decisions. No one is making those decisions unless someone is hiring them to do it. And they have no interest in doing that for you. If you make a bad decision, they won't tell you what caused you to make it.

That is what the government is for, right? It is for the ""public"" to tell the government what to do. That is what we ""need to"" need from them. It is to ""take care of"" people like you.

And they do it to get paid.

People get more important things like a mortgage, food, fuel, and so forth when they pay for them by giving their money to a tax collector, or by voting for them. This kind of ""bartering"" of ""need"" is what government is for.

"""In general, I think the national media has been very restrained in showing the Islamic State flag, and I think that's a good thing,"" he said.

It is not. The Islamic State is exploiting this fact, and using it to its advantage.

The Islamic State has been broadcasting its propaganda in English for months. In one video, the group's leader — Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi — is shown speaking in English, and his English accent is clearly noticeable. The English-language videos are most likely being circulated by the people who believe Baghdadi is speaking to them.

The Islamic State routinely broadcasts its videos to the group's followers in English. The group has also posted English-language propaganda on its Twitter feed and on YouTube. This makes it easier for people in the United States and Europe to find the videos.

The Islamic State has also used the English-language clips (the group's official English-language channel is called ""News and Media of the Islamic State"") to build a sense of solidarity among its supporters.

A video released in July of U.S. military airstrikes against a large convoy of Islamic State fighters in Syria, which the Islamic State claimed was killed by the airstrikes but which was later confirmed to be fake, is a particularly good example. The video opens with a man on a black motorcycle riding through the desert in the background, claiming that the airstrikes are a sign of the imminent arrival of the Islamic State. But then the video cuts to a voice-over announcing that U.S. airstrikes had killed ""some of the fighters.""

The man on the motorcycle then thanks the U.S. airstrikes.

""Now it is only the beginning,"" the voice-over says. ""The Islamic State will soon come to you.""

A third video released this week shows what appears to be a large convoy of Islamic State fighters in Syria. The convoy appears to be traveling on two large trucks, with a number of fighters on each. However, as the video cuts to a voice-over announcing a coalition airstrike, the trucks start to move again.

This time, however, the airstrikes are no longer in the distance. Instead, the airstrikes are clearly visible on the ground, and the convoy is located a few miles behind the coalition plane.

The video eventually cuts back to the narrator, who claims that the airstrikes were a sign of the imminent arrival of the Islamic State.

In another video, a man is shown on a black motorcycle. In a voice-over, he claims that the airstrikes are a sign of the imminent arrival of the Islamic State, and that the United States is about to fall. He also claims that the coalition plane in the background is the coalition plane that is about to take down the Islamic State.

The man then continues his speech, announcing that the U.S. airstrikes will soon be followed by the Islamic State coming to the"

"I'm back to my regular, if not not completely regular, blog posting schedule. This one is going to be a little lighter; it's a book review. However, I had a few comments and emails about my book review and I did want to do something worth reading, so in addition I'm including a few stories by people who have been good enough and nice enough to let me borrow some of their books. I'm going to try to post them, at least those I remember the title of (many will be by writers I just don't know that well), sometime next week. If anyone out there has ever been kind enough to loan you a book, or has an old one they wish they still had, and you want me to give you a review… please let me know. I'm always interested in reading anything.

I do have a few stories that I do not remember the title. I'm not sure of the order in which they came, but here they are…

–My friend Daniele tells me she's gotten a lot of good reviews about her book and she likes how I think it's written, and I'd love to read it but I do not. I think the plot is a little convoluted.

–Kathy tells me she read her book, The Grief Garden, and she loved it. She really liked the idea of writing in an alternate fiction. I do not like alternate realities.

–Shelley tells me her book is one of her favorites and she thought it was awesome. I don't like that she got the book's title wrong.

–I'm always interested to know what someone is reading and I was so excited when Holly recommended my book, The Devil's Web. If anyone out there is also reading The Devil's Web and would like to let me know… I'd love to read it.

–A friend sent me a copy of this book and she loved it. I liked the idea but the concept was a little confusing to me. I also don't read fantasy so I've never read the books that this book may be based on. (Though I really liked his book, I think that one was from the same series called Dark Tower and that is the one I want to read.) Also, the concept of being a time traveler wasn't as interesting to me.

–I never read any of Robert Jordan's books, but I want to read The Wheel of Time next.

(Yes, these are all by men so they were probably written by men and written by men for men and probably are men-only books; they're not going to be really anything I haven't read.)

I may have missed some, so please don't hold it against me.

So I've read The Devil's Web. I liked it well enough. I think it's very good writing, I really liked the story and if"
"Simon & Schuster has announced that it will drop the book Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird from all its stores after a Mississippi State University student filed a federal lawsuit against the company.

The lawsuit alleges that the publisher ""shuttered Lee's books and property"" after the student complained that they ""contained offensive and racist language.""

""This is a very just resolution,"" said attorney Thomas Mesereau, who represents the student in the suit.

""Despite the fact that these books are protected by the First Amendment, they were nonetheless deemed by the publisher to be unreadable because of their racially offensive content,"" Mesereau said. ""The publisher's only justification for firing them was the student's complaint.""

The lawsuit was filed last month on behalf of Epps High School student Anthony Ray, who is black and was offended by the novel because of its portrayal of a lynching.

The publisher had issued a statement in June saying that the book ""does not reflect their values.""

In the statement, the company also said it would remove the book from its shelves.

The lawsuit claims that the publisher refused to allow Epps High School students to purchase the books and that they were not allowed to check out the books at the school's library.

The book is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book that was published in 1960.

The lawsuit does not seek monetary damages.

"A few years ago, I saw a trailer for one of the big game-changers on the horizon: the next generation. But something about the film confused me. What's that about?

The movie was called Ready Player One, it was all about virtual reality. It seems there's a game and a game-like set-up and a series of quests set up to help a guy called Wade Watts get to a virtual game where the stakes are higher and the outcomes better. Maybe you'll be able to escape virtual reality, find your mother in virtual reality, or save your friend who's in virtual reality. This, I thought, was quite a spectacle for the time, when everyone was getting excited about 3D gaming. But what's next?

Then, I found myself watching the trailer again. It really is a thing now.

It is now, I think, because there is no one else but us: the consumers to keep pushing our technology to new places, like virtual reality. And it's not just technology, like 3D gaming or virtual reality, it's people; the game designers, the writers, the actors, the directors. All are doing it because they want to tell the story of what virtual reality can be.

In real life, I could just as easily see a virtual reality world as take a nap.

So it's all about us. But I don't think it makes for too great a story. My first thought is that people might want to make their own story because they've read a great one that's already been told. But then I saw the trailer again, and it still sort of confused me. Did the film just feel like, the world is going to be ruined soon? Is that why you're getting into virtual reality? To escape reality?

The story is about the future, if you want to read it as such. It's about a technology that's going to be able to keep us busy for ever, where we can go all day playing and just be ourselves. The main character, Wade Watts, is going to find out he's a genius and he's going to save the world somehow.

But his friends say the virtual world is going to be so much more than gaming that it will actually be a form of religion for the most part.

I think about movies where the protagonist goes from a small town to New York City for a big, huge story, and the story is about technology; the same technology that will allow us to really live out our fantasies. One of the biggest questions raised about virtual reality is whether or not it will make us live more like the computer people have imagined and more like the fantasy characters in Hollywood movies.

This is the main idea: that virtual worlds are going to be a place for us to have our experiences that will make us think about ourselves in ways we have so far not considered.

"Rafael Nadal is not going to make a return to his home country of Spain until he has won the French Open, the Spaniard's parents have confirmed. Rafa, who won last year's French Open at Roland Garros in just his 19th match, is still on the ATP's banned list for the year. The 35-year-old would therefore have to compete in the Indian Wells Masters or Wimbledon to get back to the Grand Slams.

In their statement, the Nadal family also expressed their gratitude to their son for his achievements.

The statement from Nadal's parents read: ""On behalf of my son Rafael, we sincerely thank all Spaniards, as well as everyone who cheered him on throughout the season. He was given every opportunity and was treated with respect. Our son continues his development and we know his path will continue.""

Rafa Nadal won the first Grand Slam title of his career last month with a 7-6, 6-1 victory over Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open. Nadal also made history by winning his second Grand Slam title at Roland Garros, losing only one match against fellow Spaniard Diego Schwartzman.

Nadal is set to return to the ATP for the first time in nearly four years during the Indian Wells tournament.

Nadal's next appearance will be in the US Open and he will face fellow Spaniards Juan Martin del Potro and Stan Wawrinka before competing in Wimbledon and the US Open.

"I'm working on a new book that will be released mid-March. The book, which will be available on Amazon and Barnes and Noble, will be my entry into the Writer's Digest Contemporary Authors contest.

In the spirit of the contest, I wanted to put together this post discussing the important roles of alpha and beta readers, and how they can be used to enrich a writer's writing.

I'm not going to cover the specifics of how to find beta readers in this post. I'm sure you can find plenty of articles on the internet on that topic. I'm going to focus on how to get the most out of your alpha readers.

What are alpha readers?

Alpha readers are an essential part of any writer's toolkit. They are the people that you turn to when you need to find an edge over your competition. They don't just read your writing but also your emails and social media posts.

They don't just read the final draft. They have a second set of eyes on your work, as well. They are the people that give you the feedback that makes you better.

How do you use an alpha reader?

If you want to put your work in the hands of an alpha reader, here are a few tips.

1) Be clear about what your goal is.

If you are a writer looking for beta readers, you need to be 100% clear about what you are looking for.

You must be able to state clearly what you want the reader to do, not just what they will do. This will give the reader a clear sense of what you are looking for.

2) Be specific.

You want the reader to be able to get what you want, not just guess what you want.

3) Be specific in the type of feedback your alpha reader gives you.

Alpha readers are not just going to have general opinions. They are going to give you specific recommendations as to what to improve upon. This is important as that will give you a clear direction for what you want them to do.

4) Have a clear process.

You know what you want your alpha reader to do. You also know what you don't want them to do.

To get your alpha reader to do what you want them to do, you need to make sure you follow a clear process.

5) Be willing to listen.

You can ask for feedback when you get the chance. But, you don't want to get too attached to what you are getting. You must be willing to listen to your alpha reader.

6) Be ready to change your course.

You don't want to get too attached to your idea. You have to be willing to change your course if needed. You can't just put your idea into a box. You have to be willing to experiment."
"The Air Force has ""dramatically increased"" the use of its nuclear weapons in Iraq and Syria in recent months, a senior Air Force official told lawmakers on Wednesday.

Air Force Gen. David Goldfein, head of Air Combat Command, said the ""dramatic increase"" in the use of the bombs and missiles was made possible by the increasing use of precision-guided munitions, the Wall Street Journal reported.

ADVERTISEMENT

""We have significantly increased the effectiveness and lethality of our precision-guided munitions in Iraq and Syria over the last several months,"" Goldfein said at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

""We have increased the number of munitions being used and we have increased their accuracy,"" he said, according to the Journal. ""The munitions that are being used are much more accurate, and they're more accurate with a greater number of munitions.""

Goldfein added that precision-guided munitions had been used in Iraq to ""destroy infrastructure and structures"" and ""kill terrorists.""

The Air Force has used precision-guided munitions in both Iraq and Syria since the U.S. removed its troops from the two countries in 2011.

The weapons have been used to target Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq, including the group's oil refineries, Golden Division bases and armored vehicles.

The Pentagon has been using the bombs since at least 2013, but the Air Force has a much larger stockpile than the Pentagon has disclosed.

The Air Force has been using 30 B-2 bombers in Iraq for the past several months. The B-2s are the most advanced bombers in the U.S. arsenal, and have the ability to carry nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

The Air Force has also been using the B-1B Lancer bomber, which costs $184 million and can carry nuclear weapons.

Four B-1 bombers will replace four B-52 Stratofortresses, but the bombers will be removed from Iraq by early next year.

The B-1s are used primarily for training missions and nuclear deterrence operations.

The Air Force has also been subjecting the B-52 to ""enhanced"" nuclear deterrence operations.

The U.S. has conducted five nuclear tests from a B-52 in the past six years.

The Air Force has also used Air Force Global Strike Command's B-52 Stratofortress, the same bombers that carried the nuclear weapons to Japan in World War II.

The B-52s were used in the lead-up to the Iraq War when the U.S. was fighting Saddam Hussein's forces."
"DURHAM — State Rep. Joe Carr Jr. has been arrested for allegedly possessing child pornography, according to Durham police.

A police report issued Friday stated that a Durham detective on Tuesday located a computer in a room on Carr's Capitol Hill property displaying ""a large volume of child pornography.""

In a news release issued Thursday, Carr had said that the computer was purchased last year, and that it was connected to a computer at the University of Connecticut. Durham police said that information was incorrect and that the police department has since been contacted by the university.

Carr resigned in September, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. His resignation, effective Wednesday, is effective immediately, the release said, with Carr agreeing to comply with any and all ""reasonable"" requests of the police.

""I made a mistake, and the mistakes of my youth were a time of my life that will always remain a part of my personal history,"" Carr said when he resigned.

He did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Carr, a Democrat, served as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, and was elected to Congress in 2011, replacing Eric Lacy. A member of the Democrat Caucus, Carr is now running as a candidate for the 8th congressional district, which is being vacated by incumbent Rep. Chris Gibson.

State Rep. Robert Fisher, who represents Durham, said Carr has been his friend for years.

""He's been a good member of our community,'' Fisher said.

In February, the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee approved a suspension of Carr, following questions from the press about why Carr was allowed to keep his law license.

""I'm not going to be involved with any more press reports,'' Carr said at the time, according to the Associated Press.

In 2015, Carr had been reported to have called in sick to work to avoid testifying before state legislators.

""All I can say is that as we all look forward to going to the district tomorrow to campaign, I hope this doesn't derail what we're going to be working on on Tuesday,'' Carr said at the time."
"[Note to readers: I am not a lawyer, but I do have a general understanding of copyright law and the implications of this story for those of you who are.]

A few years back, I wrote a piece about how I believe that the copyright law is ""dead."" It's about a particular part of the law, but it's not particularly specific. I've since been asked a number of times about whether I can justify this position. I've been told that it's a ""matter of law,"" and that every copyright law expert will say the same thing — that it's dead.

That's not quite true — a lot of people still believe that copyright is alive and well, and that everyone is correct. But the truth is that copyright is dead for a lot of people, and it's being kept that way by a few people in the entertainment industry, and it's being kept that way for a reason.

U.S. Copyright Law, 1999 to 2006

In the past, the U.S. Copyright Act had a specific section that dealt with copyrights. It was called the ""Copyright Act of 1976,"" and it was the law that I discussed in my original piece. It stated:

[T]he Fair Use doctrine is established by Congress. Fair Use is an exception to copyright law that permits use of copyrighted material without permission. The Copyright Act provides that, in determining whether a work is eligible for fair use, courts must consider the following factors: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

It took about 20 years for this exception to be codified into U.S. copyright law. However, it was codified in 1998, and the first time I heard about it was in 2009, when I read an article from The New York Times about the Librarian of Congress. It said that the Librarian of Congress had received a petition from a group of scholars concerned about copyright law and copyright law scholars. The petition had been signed by a group of copyright scholars, but not by any copyright scholars.

The Librarian of Congress responded to the petition, and said that the Copyright Act was ""not applicable to booklets, articles, and other non-book material.""

However, as I wrote in the post from 2009, the Copyright Act was written to be pretty broad in limiting what could be copyrighted. The Librarian of Congress' response, and the Copyright Act itself, tell a different story.

That's why it was so odd that the Librarian of Congress had a different response to the petition than did many of"

"FOUR NATIONS, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Widely recognized as ""the world's greatest democracy,"" the United States of America is a country of more than 300 million citizens. The United States of America, as well as the United States, was established in 1776 in the heart of the British Empire. The United States of America is comprised of a number of states, territories, and the District of Columbia. One of the federal government's principal purposes is to protect and defend the nation's sovereignty. The United States is divided into fifty-eight states, each with its own government.

The United States of America is the world's sole superpower, with a population of approximately 300 million. The United States of America has the 23rd largest economy and the 25th largest military. The United States has the largest defense budget of any country in the world.

The United States of America is a republic, with all the basic governmental functions of a constitutional republic. The United States, as well as the United States, is divided into fifty-eight states, each with its own government. However, the federal government is composed of three different branches: The executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch. The legislative branch is made up of American representatives in the Federal Assembly. The judicial branch is made up of American judges in the United States Supreme Court.

The United States of America has a long history. It has been one of the world's leading powers for centuries. The United States of America was founded in 1776, the same year the United States of America was created. The United States of America was formed from the British Empire and the States of the Louisiana Territory. The original colonies were those British colonies that refused to accept the terms of the Treaty of Paris that ended the French and Indian War (1763–1765). Most of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 were opposed to the idea of a new nation and the Constitution was drafted to make the colonies independent and self-governing. The Constitution contains many provisions that are still in effect today, such as the separation of powers, the rights of the people to bear arms, the right to vote, the right to a fair trial by an impartial jury, the right to freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly, and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

The Constitution is sometimes referred to as the Bill of Rights, a term coined in 1789. The phrase was coined by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote a letter to James Madison detailing the bill of rights. The phrase ""Bill of Rights"" has since been used to refer to the first ten amendments to the Constitution.

The The Constitution was the first written constitution in the world. It was drafted during the American Revolution. The Constitution was originally adopted by delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1787. The Constitutional Convention was convened to draft the first 17 amendments to"
"On the morning of March 14, a woman calling herself ""Holly,"" posted on WeChat a note saying that she was ""in trouble,"" and would not reveal what the problem was. An elderly man responded, telling Holly he had a ""good solution"" to the problem of women getting the ""full effect"" of her hormone treatment. If the man were a member of the medical establishment, he could use this explanation as justification for giving hormone treatments to all women—because the best way to treat an actual disease is to treat everyone affected by that disease. The problem, however, is that none of these gentlemen in this story had any real-life experience with women who had been cured of menopause, much less a cure that actually worked. Holly, however, had experience with menopausal women and had been treated with a hormone treatment called HRT.

The WeChat thread soon began to take a turn (see the timeline below). The ""Dr. Wang Zhong"" who had initially given Holly his ""good solution to the problem,"" and who, despite being anonymous, had become so popular at the time of this incident would eventually come forward. But instead of giving up his anonymity in the face of public scrutiny, Wang went even farther. He claimed to have been the one who first discovered the medical treatments that ultimately helped women like Holly. In the process, he went on to write a long blog post that was published on WeChat about how he had found ""the cure"" to all the problems involved in treating women who were ""too old"" for menopause. A few weeks later, Wang disappeared—not because of what he had written in his blog post, but because he was arrested and detained by law enforcement for allegedly fraud. For the purposes of this post, we'll restrict ourselves merely to the most dramatic portion of that post and the fact that it is completely untrue, including his claim that Holly was a woman who was too old to need hormone treatments.

In his online diatribe, Wang said the following:

All these women have been diagnosed by doctors who are not good doctors with no knowledge about how women with PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) suffer…. It is my dream to help people become healthy and give them the good feeling and happiness they deserve. That is why they need to have this kind of medicine, which is not available in China. Even a doctor may do something wrong when he gives a medicine they do not understand. It is easy to blame the doctors because many of them do not want to be associated with PCOS, but I have no interest in being a scapegoat for that, and I am the one who has to pay.

In a Facebook post that was published after Wang disappeared as well, the doctor wrote another diatribe about how he had treated and had cured women suffering from what he called ""PCOS,"" using an assortment of unconventional treatments, including a strange conco"
"Shelby County officials have been accused of releasing a racist manifesto penned by a white supremacist, according to a report.

The document was allegedly written by John R. Hoehn, a black man who has served time in jail for burglary, according to The Clarion-Ledger.

Law enforcement officials told The Clarion-Ledger that Hoehn is ""in the process of writing a racial hate manifesto"" and that he was ""in the process of gathering information.""

Hoehn is currently charged with first-degree murder in the death of Dr. David Cox Sr., who was fatally shot in his home on Aug. 29, according to The Clarion-Ledger.

A grand jury has indicted Hoehn on the murder charge, but the document ""is not the basis for the indictment,"" according to according to a statement from the Shelby County district attorney's office.

The document, which was originally obtained by the Clarion-Ledger, is reportedly written by Hoehn.

He allegedly wrote that he wanted to kill black people in the United States.

""If I can't have you, no white man will,"" he wrote, according to The Clarion-Ledger.

Hoehn, who was arrested Aug. 30 in Tennessee, is being held without bond at the Shelby County Detention Center.

He allegedly admitted to writing the document, according to The Clarion-Ledger.

The document was reportedly investigated by the Shelby County District Attorney's Office, which is also investigating whether the county should have released it.

The statement from the district attorney's office said that the document was ""relatively innocuous,"" but that the ""unintended posting of such a manifesto could incite additional violence.""

The document was reportedly published on Hoehn's Facebook page, which has since been removed.

The manifesto reportedly referenced the Charleston church shooting, according to The Clarion-Ledger.

Cox was fatally shot inside his home on Aug. 29.

Hoehn allegedly opened fire on Cox, according to The Clarion-Ledger.

A police officer, who was also home that night, fatally shot Hoehn after he allegedly pointed a firearm at the officer, according to The Clarion-Ledger.

Hoehn is currently being held without bond.

Shelby County Sheriff's Department officials have said that they are investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime.

Department officials have said that they are ""aware of the situation and are in the process of looking into the matter.""

Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich has said that there is ""no allegation of racial motivation"" in the shooting. She added that the department is aware of the incident, but that ""we have not received any specific information that would indicate that race was a factor"
"Fifty years ago, a small group of scientists discovered and named the first of a series of marine life species they named after the members of the Northwest Territory First Nations.

Around the same time, a small group of scientists discovered and named the first of a series of marine life species they named after the members of the Northwest Territory First Nations.

The discoveries came as a result of a special project of the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, and the work commissioned by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

The scientists wanted to study the health of a coral reef off the coast of Dauphin Island, a small region in northern Saskatchewan. The coral reef is a place where the indigenous people have been living for thousands of years.

The scientists took samples of corals off the reef, and then put them into a petri dish for the bacteria that live in the corals to grow.

The researchers already knew that the bacteria carried genes from the algae, the bacteria had a gene from the coral, the algae had a gene from the algae and so on.

But the scientists wanted to see if they could get them all to the same place. They thought this might be easier if they used DNA, and they tested out different DNA methods.

They were particularly interested in one method.

""We mixed the DNA,"" says Kevin Sorenson.

He's one of the researchers. He's a paleobiologist. He studies the evolution of life.

He's also an engineer, and he's an expert in using DNA to make genetic programs that can carry out complicated tasks.

""We used this technology to put them all together,"" he says. ""We did that using a technique called'sequencing by hand'.""

He says that's where you take the DNA, put them in a tube and then you spin them around. You can use that to discover new DNA patterns.

DNA is the blueprint for life.

""The way we found all this DNA was by using a technique called'sequencing by hand'. We took the DNA, we mixed it with some chemicals and put it into a tube and spun it around,"" says Sorenson.

The scientists discovered that they got similar results when they sequenced with a technique called 'archaeobiotic DNA sequencing'.

That technique was used to sequence DNA from ancient DNA samples. The ancient DNA is the kind that comes from fossils.

""The results were similar to what the others had found,"" Sorenson says.

He says he hopes these findings will lead to better understanding of the health of the health of the Northwest Territories.

""We've already got a substantial amount of knowledge about what is going on in this community and about what is going on in the health of the reef,"" Sorenson says.

""We hope the results will lead to"

"In the wake of another failed coup attempt, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appears to be looking for other ways to eliminate any challenges to his regime. Today reports are emerging that Turkey will send troops to Somalia to support the African Union's (AU) African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) against Al Shabab, a jihadist group also known as Al Qaeda's East Africa Province, the Somali terrorist group that recently took credit for a truck bombing in Mogadishu.

This move would be an escalation of Erdogan's support for anti-African forces in the Horn of Africa, specifically the al Qaeda-linked al Shabab.

Al Shabab, al Qaeda's East Africa Province, has taken credit for a recent truck bombing in the capital city of Mogadishu on July 17 that killed more than 200 people. But according to the group's spokesperson, the attack was ""an attack on the international community, the Westerners and foreigners who live in Somalia"" — not on people in the country. Turkey's deployment of forces would be a direct effort to undermine the Somali government, which has been trying to build a cohesive and inclusive response to the ongoing conflict among political factions. Turkey continues to allow arms to enter Somalia from Syria and Iraq, and it continues to support groups like Al Shabab that are opposed to the Somali government and its efforts to bring peace and prosperity to the Somali people.

Turkey's continued support for jihadist forces in the Horn of Africa shows that Ankara is continuing to undermine the gains the country made against jihadist groups in the 1990s, which were a major strategic concern for US policymakers. Turkey also continues to provide arms to the Somali group. It is also important to note that these forces have been targeted repeatedly by the United States and its regional allies, who are working to drive Al Shabab out of Somalia. The Obama administration has stepped up support for Somalia's government as a counterweight to the al Qaeda-linked groups.

The AU Mission in Somalia has been successful in targeting and eliminating Al Shabab, including defeating them in a joint operation in October 2016. However, Al Shabab is still able to exploit the instability in the country to further its political goals. As the New York Times reported last week during one of the group's most brazen attacks, ""Al Shabab fighters armed with suicide belts and explosives, along with a growing amount of Western weapons, have come to dominate the battle.""

It is clear that if Turkish forces continue to enter Somalia, they will fuel the growth of jihadists across the Horn of Africa and encourage other jihadist movements to follow suit."

"PALO ALTO, Calif. – The Stanford women's soccer team (11-4-3) defeated top-ranked Cal (9-4-5) for its sixth straight victory on Sunday night at Maples Pavilion. Stanford was awarded a 5-4 victory in penalty kicks after the teams combined for six shots.

Three of Stanford's goals – a header by sophomore forward Kadeisha Buchanan, and another in the 65th minute by sophomore forward Meghan Agosta – came through the penalty area.

With the match tied 1-1 in the 64th minute, Cal goalkeeper Abby Pincock converted a penalty kick that would have kept the teams even.

In its return to Maples Pavilion after a three-game trip to Stanford, Stanford faced the toughest test of its season. Cal took the first half, building a 1-0 lead, but three consecutive goals from Stanford pushed the Cardinal to the edge. The Cardinal's lead would then disappear, as a Cal goal-line clearance led Stanford midfielder Kadeisha Buchanan to score her fifth goal of the season, tying the match. Buchanan then completed her hat trick with a header on the penalty kicks after an assist from senior forward Meghan Agosta in the 76th minute.

Senior midfielder Samantha Mewis received a standing ovation from 1,539 fans along with a standing ovation from the entire Stanford student section as she passed out roses to all who attended.

A man in blue jeans and shirt, a brown tie and suspenders, with brown boots and dark glasses, he looks a bit more rugged and more militaristic than a generic soldier, while the same can be said for several characters that appear in Grand Theft Auto V in various shades of brown, black, white and grey. He is also the leader of the Militia in New Bordeaux.

In Grand Theft Auto V, Pantaleo is an ex-military officer with a long history of fighting crime in Liberty City. Although he claims to have seen ""the good side"" of the military, his actions as the leader of the Militia in New Bordeaux demonstrate that Pantaleo sees the military primarily as a way out of his problems.

Biography

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

"" You got a warrant for the arrest of my brother? "" -Pantaleo warning for Mike Toreno

Pantaleo is the leader of the Militia of the New Bordeaux Government in Vice City, and has a short relationship with Michael, due to his actions, which result in Michael's dismissal from the Militia. To earn himself an honorable discharge, Mike must kill his cousin, a mafia hitman. A warrant will be placed on Michael's father, Johnny Toreno, who is serving a life sentence for murdering an enemy in the War on Drugs. Shortly after the murder, someone in a military uniform appears at Johnny's apartment and gives him the information. When Mike finds out his father's identity, he attempts to kill him, but is thwarted and killed by Michael instead. After a lengthy chase the hitmen are eventually killed in a police shootout. It is possible for one shot at the hitman (which does not require the player to be shot at themselves) to kill him and then get the warrant put on Mike (which must be given to Johnny). This is an extra reward.

According to the mission description of the ""N.T.A. Contract"" he appears to have been the police officer shot and killed on August 4, 1992.

Like in Vice City, Pantaleo appears as a playable character in the mobile version of Grand Theft Auto V. When the player starts the game in the Militia HQ, he will automatically become the leader in New Bordeaux. The player can either kill Michael to gain the Vice Presidential pardon or kill his old partner Johnny Toreno. After the first player finishes the mission, the mission is complete.

CALGARY - The Alberta government says it is considering an oil and gas royalty review after it was criticized by several oilpatch groups.

The province's environment minister has announced a review of royalties after oil prices plunged to an 11-year low.

Premier Alison Redford was asked Wednesday if she would consider a review of royalties and royalties are currently set by legislation.

""We need to look at it. We're doing that right now,"" she said.

Redford's office says she will be speaking out about revenues from oil and gas with the petroleum industry, provincial economists, Alberta universities and academics.

In July, the Alberta Petroleum Products Institute said royalties should be cut and it will be prepared to take its case to Ottawa.

The Institute of Petroleum Economics says the government must act to boost the national economy and it wants an immediate review of royalty rates because oil prices will not recover until the end of 2014.

""It cannot be that they get all the way to $70 a barrel and you have to spend three years reviewing it to get a few extra dollars back,"" said IEP Executive Director David Hughes.

At the same time, IEP was also critical of the oil industry for calling a review the wrong approach.

""If we're going to change the royalty regime, to what level, what size of percentage, I think most industry participants would prefer a discussion,"" said Hughes.

Oilpatch groups, including the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, say a royalty review will only hurt industries in an already challenging environment for the industry."

"Surprising no one, the latest batch of leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee revealed that top DNC officials were working to undermine Sen. Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign during the primary season.

The emails, which were published by WikiLeaks on Friday, were sent by party officials to each other, and also to DNC communications director Luis Miranda. The emails were sent between April and November of 2015.

The first email in the batch, dated April 27, 2015, was sent from Miranda to DNC Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall in an effort to get him to request that the DNC hire a ""finance team"" to ""support"" Sanders's presidential bid.

""The finance team should be prepared to raise at least $ [sic] 2 million before the first primary debate,"" Miranda wrote.

Miranda also made clear that the DNC was in ""full-on support"" of Hillary Clinton, and that the DNC was ""giving her the resources she will need to win.""

The email was sent in a remarkable show of solidarity between top DNC officials and Clinton's campaign.

""I have been working with [communications director Luis Miranda] to set up a meeting with the finance team to discuss how we can make this work,"" Miranda wrote.

The emails also showed that top DNC officials were pushing for the DNC to make significant donations to the campaign of former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.

In one email, Marshall asked Miranda for help in getting the DNC to contribute $1 million to the O'Malley campaign, noting that O'Malley had ""received zero dollars from the DNC this cycle.""

""Martin O'Malley needs a massive infusion of cash,"" Miranda replied.

Marshall then asked Miranda, ""Is there any way to make this happen? Asking for a friend.""

Miranda replied that he was ""working on it"" and added that the money would come from the DNC's ""finance team.""

In another email, Marshall asked Miranda to get the DNC to contribute $1 million to Clinton's campaign.

""We are going to need to raise at least $1M for her campaign to be competitive in the primary,"" Marshall wrote.

The emails do not indicate any final decisions were made by the DNC to ""support"" Sanders's campaign.

The DNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"The Obama administration on Thursday denied a request to block the release of a book co-authored by former national security strategist James Clapper that describes Russia's ""active measures"" in the 2016 presidential race and its election interference campaign.

The Justice Department approved the release of The Russia Hacking: Who Is Paul Manafort? and other related publications, as the latest in a string of similar decisions made by DOJ attorneys overseeing releases of classified information concerning Russia's meddling in the U.S. election, the 2016 presidential campaign and Russia's activities in other countries, including France and Germany.

An earlier, similarly-filmed version of The Russia Hacking: Who Is Paul Manafort? ran in July, under a different title. The book had been slated for an August release but was delayed following the White House's decision to oust ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn in February.

The government has previously asked courts not to prevent or delay the release of various sensitive documents that detail the Russian interference campaign in the White House race, including details of Flynn's communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, the release of classified documents and the government's decision to lift restrictions on a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele alleging improper business dealings between President Donald Trump and Moscow. The document was compiled by a former British intelligence officer.

In the case of Clapper's book about Moscow, The Obama administration had sought to block it, arguing in part that the book could damage the nation's ""ongoing investigations"" into Russia's election meddling. In the latest action, the Trump White House, citing new evidence, argued in part that Obama violated the law in attempting to block the book's publication.

The Justice Department rejected the White House's arguments.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for the full text of the government's decision granting the Freedom of Information Act request brought on by the Trump administration.

Clapper's co-author, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. William G. ""Jerry"" Boykin, had said earlier in July that the government had requested a delay on publication, in the hopes that then-candidate Trump would ""come to his senses.""

Boykin, a retired senior military officer who was the Pentagon's commander in Afghanistan — and served as an adviser to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign — wrote in his first public comments on the matter that he supported a government ban on the book's publication because an investigation may have resulted in new facts about Hillary Clinton's emails.

But he also suggested there may have been a need for continued discussion about Russia's election meddling.

""Let us at least sit down and have a dialogue about whether Russia has the resources they were going to put in [the U.S. election] to defeat her, to undermine her, to create the narrative they wanted to portray, and if they didn't,"" Boykin said in a July interview.

When you look at the opening of the history of the ""Burma Road"" you will see the current administration at the time the road was built, the Japanese Imperial Army.

The road was built as part of a military project called ""Rancho Kawaguchi,"" which was designed to provide access to the Department of Military Supply in the late 1930s. The road was intended to be used by Japanese laborers sent to the province of Kyushu, which is now part of Japan.

The road was built specifically for the purpose of facilitating the transportation of soldiers and supplies.

One of the first to use the road was the Ministry of Military Supply at the time, and the road became a famous shortcut among the Japanese troops stationed in Kyushu.

However, the road was also used by the Japanese Imperial Army to access the area in order to fight the Chinese Communists in the 1930s.

The road was constructed using Japanese shovels and Japanese carpenters. The route was constructed using a channel cut through the rocks at the bottom of the mountain, and the road was made up of a mix of Japanese and Chinese construction materials.

The Japanese troops arrived at this area around 1930 and the road was completed in December 1931.

The Japanese army was deployed in the area in the late 1930s, and their presence was no accident.

The road was built to facilitate the transportation between the Japanese military bases in Kyushu and the south of China, as well as to provide access to the ports that were being constructed in the area."

"It's not all that easy to keep track of a person's movements when he's using Google Glass, as we saw earlier this week. But, thanks to a new app from developer Tilde, we can at least give you a sense of what's going on when you're on a plane, with your Google Glass, in the subway, or when you're wearing them indoors.

Tilde is the sort of guy who's probably been on the Internet all day and knows what's going on in the world that's been going on all day. So, he's created a little app that will show you a tiny preview screen where you can see the time and a clock for the same time zone. And if you're flying in a country with different time zones, like the US, you can easily identify exactly where you're located within that country and where you'll be when you land.

Tilde has created this little gadget app, which can be installed on most smartphones. You simply need to tap a button on your screen, and it'll pop open on your iPhone or Android phone. Next, you're prompted for your location. Then you're asked whether or not you want to use Glass (you can only use it indoors, with it installed), and if you do then you'll need to enter your Google credentials. Then, you're shown a brief glimpse through your Glass' tiny screen into what's happening in your world.

You can use your smartphone's GPS feature or tell it to show you what's coming up on its Maps app, which is what we normally do when we are on Google Maps. You'll also be able to tap a tiny ""X"" on the side of your Glass to stop the overlay, which is helpful if you want to stop looking at what's going on.

Tilde is not the first to have done something like this, but he's one of the very few to have already created an app specifically for Glass. It's worth mentioning, however, that if you're not in the mood to take a second to manually keep track of time, you can always set your phone to use the time on the GPS feature and just see who's on the way."
"Why have I been so paranoid about my computer and the security of my private data for the last day? Because I've discovered a new kind of spyware that's designed to hack into my computer's webcam and record my screen.

The spyware is called ""Amnesia"" and it's designed to be installed on your computer when you're not at home and you don't have any browser cookies on your computer. It's a great way to snoop on your friends' computers and steal their passwords. It's also supposed to be done in a way that won't alert you that it's happening, but because of this, it's incredibly easy to install.

Amnesia is designed to look like the normal Firefox and Chrome apps, but on your computer's webcam. It installs itself to the webcam and monitors your activity for up to an hour. If you start typing anything into your computer, the spyware will capture your screen and record it. It will then send this to a server outside of your country.

It's important to note that Amnesia is not a virus. It's a spyware that's being sold on a legitimate website that promises to protect you from malware. The spyware will send your screen and keystrokes to a server in Poland at the end of each hour. Even if you wipe the spyware from your Windows computer, the data will still be sent to the server.

It's a great way to spy on your friends, but it's still a violation of your privacy. You should never install spyware on your computer. If you're concerned about security, you should use a free antivirus program.

How to Remove ""Amnesia"" Spyware From Your Computer

If you're concerned about this spyware, you should delete it from your browser's cache and add-ons. You can do this by opening your browser and going to the browser's preferences. Then, click the ""Advanced"" button in the bottom left. You'll see a list of your browser's add-ons. Click the ""Extensions"" tab. You'll see a list of all the extensions that are installed on your computer. Next to ""Amnesia"" is a check box. Click the box and then click ""Delete"".

You can also just uninstall the spyware without deleting the add-ons. Just go to the add-ons tab and click the ""Manage"" button.

"After a new and very successful launch, the Nintendo 3DS/2DS family is in the midst of a major upgrade. As part of the 3DS/2DS family, Nintendo has released a new system, the 3DS XL, and a new handheld, the 2DS. While the 3DS XL is similar to the 3DS, the 2DS is a new handheld system that was released alongside the 3DS XL. While we don't have numbers for the 3DS/2DS family, Nintendo has stated that they are planning on releasing a new system called the ""New Nintendo 3DS"" in 2014.

The New Nintendo 3DS is a new handheld system that was unveiled alongside the 3DS XL. It is essentially a bigger and improved version of the 3DS, and it has the same size as the 3DS. It has a larger screen, a larger battery, and a slightly improved screen. It also has a new stylus that allows you to do a lot more than just draw on the screen.

There are a few items that you can expect to see on the New Nintendo 3DS. Firstly, the New Nintendo 3DS would have the same size screen as the 3DS. Unlike the 3DS, the New Nintendo 3DS would also have a stylus. The stylus is going to be similar to the iPad's stylus. It is going to allow you to do a lot more than just draw. You will be able to draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, and draw. This new stylus will also be very much like the one found on the Nintendo 3DS and the New Nintendo 3DS XL.

The New Nintendo 3DS XL is a new version of the New Nintendo 3DS. It is essentially a bigger and improved version of the 3DS XL. It has the same size screen as the 3DS XL, and it has, according to Nintendo, the same battery life of the 3DS XL. The New Nintendo 3DS XL has a slightly improved screen and a larger battery. It also has a new stylus that allows you to do a lot more than just draw. It has more features than the 3DS XL, such as the ability to take photos, and that makes the New Nintendo 3DS XL much more of a portable system than the 3DS XL.

"On every presidential debate stage, the candidates are asked whether they would support a certain policy, such as a limit on immigration. Donald Trump's position on immigration is as clear as it is controversial: he would build a wall along the southern border and deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants. He has also suggested that if Mexico won't pay for the wall, the United States will.

But the Trump campaign has not offered much detail on how it would accomplish this goal.

This week, in an attempt to address this lack of clarity, the Trump campaign released a set of immigration policies that it says will show that Trump is willing to make tough decisions and put the American people first. But none of the policies has been released yet.

Let's take a closer look at the four policy proposals that the Trump campaign released on Thursday.

1. A ""Deportation Force""

The Trump campaign's immigration policies are important as they represent a new departure for the GOP frontrunner. Unlike other candidates, who focus on criminal undocumented immigrants, Trump has actually proposed a de facto deportation force to take care of immigrants who are in the country illegally.

The plan calls for the creation of a deportation squad that would be composed of 15,000 law enforcement officers. These officers would be trained to identify immigrants who are undocumented and use the tools of modern law enforcement, including the use of force, to apprehend them.

2. ""Achieve the Border Wall""

The Trump campaign's immigration plan states that it will fund ""a wall along the southern border."" The plan also says that Trump ""will use the full force and power of the executive branch to remove all illegal immigrants from the country"" and that he will ""develop plans to detain aliens at military installations and remove them if necessary.""

Trump's plan doesn't specify how he would pay for this more than $20 billion plan, but it doesn't require the government to spend more on immigration enforcement. Instead, Trump wants to use existing funds to pay for a wall.

3. ""Double the Border Patrol""

The Trump campaign's immigration plan also calls for doubling the number of border patrol agents. The plan also calls for ""more detention space for illegal immigrants.""

4. Put a moratorium on all Muslim immigration

The Trump campaign's immigration plans call for a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.""

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

What's especially troubling about Trump's immigration plan is that it would put the weight of the federal government behind targeting immigrants of a certain religion. The proposal would target people of Middle Eastern descent, people of South Asian descent, and people of African descent—all people with a common origin.

It would also target people who are LGBT. Trump's immigration plan states that the ban would cover ""anyone who"
"This weekend, the world will witness a historic milestone: the first time it's seen a star-forming black hole. And for the next several days, we can look forward to a special astronomy event called ""Lonely Galaxy Project.""

Astronomers at Fermilab and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory will be using radio telescopes and the Chandra X-ray Observatory to gather data about the black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy.

For the first time ever, experts will attempt to spot and even characterize X-rays from a gas cloud that surrounds its supermassive black hole. That data will help scientists better understand how supermassive black holes form and grow – and could yield some interesting insight into our own solar system.

""As a team, we had our sights set on the star-forming region in which the black hole is located,"" said Fermilab astronomer Eric Rignot, a collaborator on the team.

The first time astronomers have seen X-rays from a supermassive black hole is an odd event: it can show the same properties as X-rays from a massive star, but they are produced by a gas cloud in a very close orbit around the black hole.

""Normally, the gas in the central region of a huge elliptical galaxy would be scattered and emitted in much higher energy X-rays,"" said Jochen Poldrack, an associate professor of physics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. ""Our aim is to discover if the same happens around a star-forming region, like the central regions of our own Milky Way, where this gas is produced.""

According to Rignot, previous research has shown it likely that, when a star is formed within a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, the black hole will engulf many of the surrounding gas clouds. Once the black hole has fed off most or all of these clouds for some time – perhaps a few billion years, or longer – the gas cloud at the center of the supermassive black hole suddenly turns on its X-ray source of light, a process scientists call accretion.

This is because the surrounding gas in the central region begins to rapidly collapse inward, and as a result, the gas cloud itself is dragged into the center of the black hole.

At this point, the gas cloud's orbit will have already become very unstable. When this happens, many of its molecules will begin to break apart. However, the gas cloud will be held together by magnetic field lines that extend from its heart. As the gas cloud collides and loses its remaining molecules, these magnetic field lines will pull on the cloud's electrons, generating high-energy X-rays.

""The magnetic field lines act like a giant vacuum cleaner,"" Rignot explained. ""Once a gas cloud collapses completely into the center of a black hole, these fields drag it close to the"

""" "" The Islamic State has been carrying out mass killings, for years, in Iraq and Syria.

The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that was formed in July 2014, when the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) merged.

According to Reuters, the Islamic State is a ""a radical Sunni insurgent group that has declared a caliphate, or Islamic state, in parts of Iraq and Syria.""

But before it was a terrorist organization, the Islamic State was called Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).

AQI and ISI were formed in the wake of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which ousted Saddam Hussein, who was a secular dictator and supported by the U.S.

The group, which now calls itself the Islamic State, took advantage of the chaos of the post-Saddam years to gain a foothold in Iraq.

The group was later joined by Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which was formed by former members of the Iraqi insurgency and was led by Abu Musab al Zarqawi, a Jordanian who had been involved in the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan.

RELATED: The Rise and Fall of Al Qaeda

After the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2006.

AQI and ISI were primarily focused on attacking American forces in Iraq, but they later changed tactics and became more involved in the Syrian Civil War.

AQI and ISI were also responsible for attacks on Western targets, including the suicide bombing of a U.S. airplane in December 2001, which killed nearly 3,000 people.

The group threatened to kill the West in a video released in August 2013, calling the West ""an enemy of Islam."""
"This study aimed, among other things, to investigate the effect of the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) on bone density (BMD) in adolescents who participated in a longitudinal study. An exploratory analysis was carried out that included 1599 male adolescents in the United Kingdom as part of this study who were first assessed at the age of 13 years and then followed at an average follow-up of 11.5 years. A single measure of BMD from DXA was calculated. In multivariate analysis, age were significantly correlated with height in both males and females. Also, in multivariate analysis, age did not explain the differences in BMD among males and females. We conclude that in adolescents, the AAS use is associated with an increased risk for bone thinning. Nevertheless, the use of AAS does not appear to be significantly associated with reduced BMD in females either."
"I was a young girl growing up in the 1970s. I always wondered why there were no male superheroes. The comics weren't that bad, but there were certainly no male super-heroes. I also remember that I wanted to be a superhero so bad that I didn't mind wearing dresses and getting my hair done. It was only after I read the comics and watched the movies that I really understood the sexism of the industry.

I have to admit, I'm a bit nostalgic for the time when there were no male superheroes. The comics were far more than just men and women. I remember the covers of the comics – the ones they put on the shelves in shops back then. There was a lot of variety and diversity. There were female super-heroes, male super-heroes, gay super-heroes, black super-heroes, red-haired super-heroes, blonde super-heroes, freckly super-heroes, tall super-heroes, short super-heroes, etc. And then there were the aliens and other fantastical creatures that appeared in the comics. I remember reading the Tales of the Teen Titans and the Archie Comics. I was also a fan of the Batman and other superheroes.

When I started to wonder about the lack of male superheroes, I started to look for superheroes in the media. I looked into the movies and TV shows. I bought comic books and graphic novels. I read comic books – usually the men's titles. I read comic books and graphic novels that were written by women. I read comic books by female writers, and male writers and artists. I read comic books written by gay men and women. I read comic books written by women and gay men. I read graphic novels written by women and gay men.

"The US Senate passed the historic Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) on Thursday, sending it to the White House for President Obama's signature.

The legislation, which the House had passed earlier in the week, is widely seen as a potential model for other countries that want to pass laws that actively support the surveillance state.

Though the bill's passage is a victory for the surveillance state, it carries significant limitations.

First, the bill only applies to the private sector, which means that it doesn't apply to the government or its contractors. Second, it only applies to information shared with the government.

Third, the bill requires companies to store the data for a year and only share the data with the government when the government requests it. The government can then request more information from the private company.

And fourth, the bill would only apply to companies that operate in the US — not outside the US.

The bill also allows companies to share information with other companies or with the government, but only if they also operate in the US.

The House passed the bill on Wednesday by a vote of 248 to 168. The final vote was 215 to 205. The two amendments defeated were from Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) — both of whom are known as ""libertarian-leaning"" and are seen by the establishment as potential threats to the surveillance state.

Amash introduced an amendment that would have limited the bill's scope to sharing information with the government, and Wyden's amendment would have expanded the bill's scope to include private sector sharing.

""We are living in a society where the government is collecting information on the average American, on everyone,"" Wyden said. ""That's not what the Fourth Amendment's about. The Fourth Amendment is about people having the information they need to make informed decisions.""

""The House bill is the work of a small, powerful, secretive group of lawmakers,"" Wyden added. ""It's not a bill that reflects the values of the American people. It's a bill that reflects the special interests of a small, powerful and secretive group of lawmakers. And it's a bill that would make all of us less safe.""

Obama has already indicated that he supports the bill, though he has made clear that he wants it to be re-worked.

The bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-CT) in September.

The bill is part of a series of ""cybersecurity"" bills that the Obama administration has promoted and promoted aggressively, including the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 (CASA), the Cybersecurity Act of 2013 (CASA-2013), the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center Act (CCIA), and the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2014 ("
"The election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president has led to a surge in sales of Japanese-made cars in the U.S.

The sales have been driven by a surge in demand for luxury cars, with the Japanese market for such cars rising by 29 per cent in the first quarter, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.

The sales are being driven by a surge in demand for luxury cars, with the Japanese market for such cars rising by 29 per cent in the first quarter, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. (CBC)

Sales of luxury vehicles in the U.S. rose by 20 per cent in the first quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, with sales of the Porsche Porsche all-terrain vehicle up by 37 per cent and sales of the BMW BMW X5 SUV up by 32 per cent, the association said.

It said some of the reasons for the surge in demand for high-end luxury vehicles include strong demand in China, where the luxury car market is booming, and a strong U.S. dollar.

""The strong U.S. dollar is making the cost of imports more expensive, and it's impacting the sales of some luxury vehicles,"" said JAMA President and CEO Kenichi Fukuda.

""The high-end luxury vehicle market is still extremely strong in the U.S., and if you look at what's happening in China and the biggest markets in the world, the U.S. is still the number one market.""

Sales of Porsche, BMW and Audi vehicles account for about a third of the luxury car market in the U.S.

Fukuda said that in the first quarter, there was a slow down in sales of other luxury vehicles including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Cadillac and Audi.

In Japan, the luxury market is expected to remain strong for the next few years, with new models, including the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the BMW 5-Series, expected to arrive in the country in 2016.

""The key to the success of the Japanese luxury car market is to continue to innovate and make new models, and to find ways to provide a new and better experience,"" said Fukuda.

JAMA says the number of luxury vehicles on Japanese roads is expected to jump to about 18 million cars in 2020 from about 10.5 million in 2012."
"Barry Zyskind/Globe Staff/File

In the fall of 2010, I attended ""A Summer of Faith"" at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On Friday, the final day of the three-day seminar, students were asked to write their own ""faith project""—a kind of reflection of what matters to their lives as believers in Jesus Christ.

I am fortunate to be a member of MIT's Evangelical Theological Society, which sponsored the event. About 70 members of the MIT community, from undergraduate to PhD, participated. As with the previous three days of the seminar, I participated as a journalist; I did not write any of the papers I submitted to the seminar (though I did contribute to the papers I submitted to other seminars, including one I wrote about the social gospel movement at Harvard University). But I was able to hear about the seminar's participants and their writing. A colleague told me he was impressed by the diversity of ideas and perspectives reflected in the papers and comments submitted.

After hearing so much about the depth and complexity of faith, I, too, wondered if it was possible to create a brief paper about it. In a moment of reflection, about two months before the seminar in Boston, I came up with a short paper about ""Faith Project"" from a different perspective. It wasn't a research project; I never planned it that way. But it was also not intended to serve as a reflection on the life or teaching of a prominent religious thinker or academic. It was to serve as a reflection on my own religious experience.

While reading several of the submissions for the class, though, I realized how much these papers, and the discussion they generated, reminded me of how I had grown up as a religious skeptic. Some of my fellow participants—who had also expressed curiosity about the topic—made notes or suggested changes; some just encouraged me to write. I was delighted at the outpouring of support after I submitted my paper, which I titled ""The Mystery of Faith: How Science and Faith Reconcile.""

The story begins when I was 14 and living in Southern California. My family had migrated to the East Coast from New Jersey in the early 1970s, but I didn't really start to learn about Christianity until college, during a summer break from my high-school English class and a trip to a Catholic school. In the afternoon, on my way home from school, I met two teenage boys working on a crossword puzzle near the campus of Santa Clara University. They were from a very small Catholic family in a nearby town, but they'd been raised Catholic by this mother, and they were devoted to the Church.

In that context, the words ""Catholic"" and ""Christian"" seemed very different and abstract, like terms for different kinds of cars. The one I was riding in that day, the Fiat 1100 Abarth, didn't really fit these definitions. When we got"
"Rudyard Kipling

The man who has done more than any other to bring to life the spirit of 'The Jungle Book'

In early January, Rudyard Kipling had a dream. With a quill pen, a copy of his most recent book, a copy of the latest book by the artist Michael Long, and two bottles of whisky, he scribbled a long letter about his dream.

""I went to sleep and dreamed there were people there in the Jungle Book who had done a lot of mischief, and that the Lion was doing something to punish and chastize them: all the animals were trying to drive them out. I saw myself driving a man away with a staff,"" he wrote, ""and driving other beasts, and being chased by the beasts with my staff, and seeing them lose their heads and die and see their heads rolling over rocks, and then seeing the next animal be chased by them again and be wounded and die.""

""In the end a Lion, a Bear, a Wolf, and two Tigers joined in the game,"" he noted. ""And I, Rudyard, was the only one who never knew who drove a head, who did not know how he or she had been wounded. It was very curious!""

It is a dream that has been replayed over and over in the imagination of millions since — or as, perhaps, the author intended. This dream is, of course, of course a great one for Kipling. It is a dream of the ""great Indian hero,"" if you will. But there are also other great dreams of Kipling as well, and some of them were more important than the one that he dreamed for his country.

A great dream, like Rudyard, of a great leader, is always useful; and in some instances, it can produce real results. In a more profound sense, as you will see, the dream that Kipling had in January was not just a dream. It is a real one, as important, more important, in some respects, than the dreams of his other great dreams. He has used it as the basis for his life's work.

There are many great leaders who have been driven out of their places and made powerless, and in these cases the great dream was the first step in bringing about a real change. One example is Mahatma Gandhi. He began as an opponent of British rule in India, and for years had been in rebellion against his government. His dream of total independence was born of desperation. What was necessary first was complete self-knowledge of his country. He was unable to understand what was happening because of his own lack of experience, and he tried to change things himself. But in the long years of resistance, his self-knowledge and sense of power gradually became more and more limited. Finally, he lost all patience, and his frustration boiled over. On August 15, 1948, he"

The Imperial Legion

The Imperial Legion is the military arm of the Empire. They have been a part of Tamriel for over a thousand years, and have been at the forefront of the military history of Tamriel ever since. Although they have had many rivals since the beginning of the Sixth Era and now have their own legions, the Imperial Legion will always carry the blood of the Cyrodilic Empire to the next battle.[1]

The Legion is, at its core, a bureaucracy created to ensure the stability of the nation and make sure that the Imperial family keeps its seat on the throne. The Legion's strength is derived from its leadership and authority. By definition, a commander must be at least part Cyrodilic, but those who are not are assigned to the rank of legionnaire, a lower rank that grants them authority.[2] The Legions are made up of a variety factions that share the common goal of the Empire's survival.[2] They include:

The Imperial Legion consists of the following units:

History [ edit ]

The Imperial Legion has been the first military structure to stand for the Cyrodilic Empire. The Legion's origins lie in the founding of the Cyrodilic Empire by Tiber Septim in 1E 1103, as an agent of the Aldmeri Dominion. After the death of Empress Cyrodiil, her bloodline was never deemed viable enough for the successor she appointed to be the Emperor, and the empire was brought to chaos for nearly six centuries by a succession of claimants, all of whom had a desire to claim the Imperial throne for themselves. In this chaotic, anarchic period, a secret organization was formed to keep the Empire together: the Legions of the Aldmeri Dominion, or the Ebonheart Pact, later to be known as the Imperial Legion, the First Empire.[3]

After the fall of the First Empire following the Oblivion Crisis in 4E 171, the Aldmeri Dominion was conquered by the Aldmeri Dominion, and the Aldmeri Dominion began assimilating those who still believed in the Divine Right of Kings. The Alliance of Kings in particular was particularly aggressive in seeking to establish power in all of Tamriel.

The Aldmeri Dominion had conquered much of Tamriel by the time the Empire took back that territory in 4E 5. The First Empire was a weak and divided state. In 4E 10 the Second Empire was founded when a faction of Aldmeri Dominion loyalists formed a government under the leadership of High King Emeric. The Aldmeri Dominion was defeated in 4E 14, and the Second Empire, which also included the Nordic kingdoms of Reman III of High Rock and Pelinal Whitestrake of Sentinel,[4] was established during 4E 17 by King Emeric and his son Pelagius I of Wayrest after the collapse of the"

"The U.S. is an increasingly reliant power on the world stage, and a growing body of research suggests that China is the fastest growing economy. Since 2000, China has become the largest destination for U.S. foreign direct investment and one of the fastest growing economies in the world.

China is also a key military partner for the U.S. and a major source of trade. The U.S. maintains close military ties with China, and U.S. aircraft carriers have visited China as part of the annual China-U.S. naval exercise.

China's increasing economic and military power is likely to have troubling implications for the U.S. in the long term. This is not because China would necessarily challenge U.S. dominance in the region, but because the U.S. relies on China to manage and balance the democratic forces of Asia.

The U.S. is already in the midst of a serious crisis in the Asia-Pacific. China's rise is likely to threaten the political and economic stability of the region.

The electoral arrangements of regional nations will have profound effects on the stability of the region. China's rising economic and military clout will likely complicate U.S. efforts to manage and balance this rising power.

In the long term, China's rising economic and military power is likely to threaten the political and economic stability of the region. China's growing economic and military clout will likely complicate U.S. efforts to manage and balance this rising power.

Southeast Asia is an important test case for how a rising power interacts with the United States. The region is a key part of the U.S. global strategy to maintain and enhance its military power in the face of a rising China.

The U.S. military presence in Southeast Asia is relatively small. The U.S. has only four aircraft carriers based in the region and has limited military ties with the nations of the region.

However, China's growing economic and military power is likely to threaten the political and economic stability of the region.

China's growing economic and military clout is likely to threaten the political and economic stability of the region.

China's rising economic and military power is likely to threaten the political and economic stability of the region. It will also increase the region's vulnerability to regional instability.

China is a rising power with a great deal of potential for destabilizing the region.

China's Economic and Military Threat

The U.S. relies heavily on trade with China. As a share of the world GDP, China's share of trade has been increasing at a rapid pace. In 2013, China was the largest recipient of U.S. exports, accounting for 30 percent of the value of U.S. exports.

"Suzanne Venker, an author who has become a leading proponent of ""alternative medicine"" and a media darling, recently wrote an article for The Daily Beast that features a list of ""10 Things the Left Thinks"" about Trump supporters. She points to one study that showed how liberals ""viewed the Republican Party as a threat to their ideological position"" and that conservatives ""seemed to view the Democratic Party as a threat to their ideological position.""

Both groups had a tendency to ""complain about everything that the other side does,"" Venker wrote.

But while liberals seem to view Trump supporters as ""a threat to their ideological position,"" it's not clear that many of them really believe that. In fact, it seems that they're just happy to be able to say so.

As Vox's Dylan Matthews pointed out, in a survey of nearly half a million Americans conducted by the Pew Research Center, liberals were ""significantly more likely than conservatives to say they were very concerned"" about the threat of terrorism. And yet, even among liberals, only about one-third of them said they'd be worried if Trump were elected.

In other words, only one in seven liberals admitted that they were worried about Trump being elected. But as Matthews pointed out, ""If you ask people about their feelings about Trump, almost a third say they're afraid of his candidacy.""

That's hardly surprising. Trump's rhetoric has been so outrageous that it's hard to imagine a single policy that he could enact as president that wouldn't be heavily criticized. But there's also a strong strain of hostility toward Trump among many Democrats. From the beginning, many Democrats have been anxious that Trump might not win, and have tried to block him at every turn. On the campaign trail, they've accused Trump of being a ""traitor"" and a ""hate-monger.""

And yet, when it comes to Trump's supporters, there's a lot of ""very concerned"" talk.

One of the reasons for this is that liberals often conflate Trump supporters with white supremacists. There's a strong strain of anti-Semitism, and attempts to make Trump an anti-Semite, among many who support Trump. It's also true that many Trump supporters are men with a long history of supporting Republican candidates.

But that doesn't make them any less patriotic — or the sort of people who might be a danger to the country.

The fact that Trump's supporters have a majority of white-collar jobs doesn't mean that they're racists. It doesn't mean they aren't concerned about the economy or the future of the country. In fact, many of them voted for Obama because they wanted to see his agenda enacted — and because they wanted to send a message to the political establishment.

Trump, in other words, is not one of those people."

"The Cavaliers and Celtics aren't the only two teams that know how to make a statement.

The Oklahoma City Thunder once again proved that they are the class of the league Wednesday night, getting a huge win over the league-leading Golden State Warriors in a game that pushed the Thunder's record to 27-4.

The Thunder also got some clutch contributions from their bench, as Russell Westbrook and Enes Kanter each scored 16 points and grabbed a pair of rebounds.

The Thunder added another big name to their roster, as Kevin Durant was given the night off to rest after injuring his foot in the first half of the loss to the Warriors. He returned to score 27 points, but was held to just seven rebounds and three assists.

Thunder coach Billy Donovan will have to decide whether or not to start Durant, or if the team will have to rely on his bench."
"CALGARY – Premier Rachel Notley's government is spending millions of dollars on a $1.5 million advertising blitz in Alberta.

"The ""Worst Show on TV"" star will play the role of Dr. Ben Carson in CBS' ""The Real O'Neals.""

Ben Carson will head to Dallas for a new round of auditions for his next TV role.

ABC announced Tuesday that the retired pediatric neurosurgeon will star in the sitcom The Real O'Neals.

PHOTOS: TV's Most Notable Exit Interviews

The sitcom, which serves as an update to the ABC hit Roseanne, centers on two former kids on the bus who move into a single family house for the first time.

Ben has already been cast: Michael Trevino will play Ray. He recurred on the freshman CBS comedy series The Odd Couple and on the upcoming ABC comedy pilot The Grinder, and also has a recurring role on Glee.

The former neurosurgeon's casting in a TV comedy marks a major opportunity for Carson. The 43-year-old, who spent most of his life as an ophthalmologist before becoming the Republican presidential candidate, has only had one television role to his credit -- The Ben Carson Show, which ran from 2002 to 2004.

In addition to the CBS project, the former presidential candidate will star in his own comedy pilot -- called The Comedian -- that will be produced by Funny Or Die and NBC Universal. Comedy Central and Universal Cable Prods were also exec producing the project.

"The ""Prickly Pear"" is a hybrid apple tree that is a cross between the common ""Citrus"" and the ""Queen Anne"" varieties. It is named after the prickly, or prickly pear-like fruits that grow on the tree. This tree is an excellent choice for starting a fruit tree or for a tree that will be used as an ornament. It is also one of the best winter hardiness apple varieties. The tree is known for its resistance to pests and diseases, and it has a unique flavor that is similar to that of an apple. The tree is not self-fertile, and it must be propagated by grafting. The fruit is not a true apple, but a hybrid of two apples. The fruit is 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter. The tree is an evergreen tree that can grow to be up to 60 feet in height. The ""Prickly Pear"" tree is native to Canada and has become a popular tree in the United States. The tree is self-fertile and will only produce one crop each year, which is in the fall. The fruit will ripen to a dark brown to black color and the fruit will be round to oval in shape. The fruit is a tender fruit that can be picked when the skin is soft, but the skin will turn brown when the fruit is fully ripe. The fruit is normally eaten fresh or dried and can be made into jams and jellies. The ""Prickly Pear"" tree is not recommended for hanging baskets as it is not a good hanging tree. The fruit is most commonly used as a ground cover."
"The case of the mysterious, dead Syrian man, who appeared to have been killed with chemical weapons, has become a rallying cry for those who oppose the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. But is it really true that Syrian rebels have used chemical weapons on Syrian soldiers? Or was the claim just part of an elaborate hoax?

"Gift for the Wife

How would you feel about letting your wife have sex while you're on your job as a cop?

If her answer was no, I'd just tell her that this really wouldn't work as I was in the middle of a shift and I wasn't going to be at home to be able to come home and get her.

What if your wife wasn't that into the idea?

What if she just said her first reaction was, ""Oh, well, of course not. This isn't funny. Let's not do this.""

But what if you thought for a second about how she might react to this ""experiment,"" and how that might affect if that's something you decided to do as a couple?

Well, here's the thing…

If that's the type of woman you love dating more than anything, you're going to love this gift.

And if not, here's a tip for you to help you get the ""wish list"" in the bedroom if you're looking for a girlfriend with a good sense of humor and a sense of humor of your own.

I wish I could just say ""get ready, because in the next post of this series, we'll take a look at how to get her to say ""yes"" because the best relationship advice I have."

"The Man Who Ate Paris (1972)

After a bout of illness, French painter Auguste Rodin (who was 20 years old when the film was made) was forced to move to London to live with his sister. While staying with her, Rodin had an epiphany that would change his career and life forever. In a moment of inspiration, Rodin threw away his completed painting and began to draw on scraps of paper.

Rodin's decision to create an entirely different work from his completed work is what inspired the director, Michael Powell, to make his own version of Rodin's painting. The Man Who Ate Paris is a surrealistic masterpiece that explores the mysteries of a man's meaning, and the place that art can take in his life.

Bridget Jones's Diary (1984)

A favorite of many young British filmmakers, Bridget Jones's Diary shows what happens when a young woman and her friends make a series of creative decisions that might not go down well in the next town.

The film is an adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel, and features a young Brit named Bridget Jones as she travels to the fictional town of Mansfield, England to live with her parents. Bridget comes across a new friend, Mr. Darcy (played by Tom Wilkinson), who is traveling with his wife and daughter. Darcy instantly falls in love with Bridget, and it is a love that neither of them understand.

In a scene that is especially memorable, Bridget and Darcy spend a night together at the local inn, and the two of them have sex. The next morning, Bridget wakes up to find that Darcy has left for work, and she is left wondering what the two of them had to do to get so close to each other.

The film's unusual plot twists and turns and brilliant performances from Carrie-Anne Moss, Miranda Richardson, and Joely Richardson make it a must see for any movie-loving teen.

The French Connection (1971)

The French Connection is a film that has been cited as one of the most influential films of all time. It is a classic that has been seen by many generations of moviegoers during its 35 year run.

The film is set in New Orleans, Louisiana in the late 1960's, and centers around drug-addicted Thomas ""Hank"" Flagg (played by Martin Landau). It is during this time that Flagg meets and falls for Eddie (played by Richard Riehle), a local woman. The film includes several memorable scenes featuring Flagg and Eddie, as well as Flagg's attempt to make a better life for himself.

The French Connection is a film that is a constant reminder of the importance of family, love, and friendship.

"Merry Christmas everyone! Let us start with a thing or two for the rest of you.

We've got a new character class coming to the game – the Mountaineer.

As you may know, the Mountaineer is a mount class with a unique combat style. With a melee weapon and a shield, or a bow and a shield, the Mountaineer can do the tough things – like face the enemy, or trample them.

Mountaineer Mounts

If you've played Warband, you'll know that there are a few mount types in the game. The first is the horse. Horses are a great way to get around Warband, but they can also get you in trouble. Horses can be ridden in the open, but they can also be ridden in tight spaces, meaning you can't use them to their full potential. Also, horses can be attacked. You can't ride horses around the battlefield, but you can be attacked by animals.

The other mount is the Camel. A camel is a great mount to travel in the desert, but it's not a very effective mount in the open battlefield.

The new mount class is the Mountaineer. Mountaineers are a mount class with a unique combat style.

This page is deprecated. Please use the new tutorial or the current tutorial.

To get the basic knowledge of the game and basic tactics, you can visit the Tutorial

In-game links/calls for the EVE: Valkyrie gameplay (including the tutorial as well as the tips and tricks) can be found here: Tutorials (in order by date) and Tips & Tricks (in order by date)


New players

Before you even click the game button (in addition to reading the Tutorials), please make a mental note of who your character is. For example, it is highly recommended that new players not have been in the New Eden sandbox in any capacity before trying out EVE: Valkyrie, so as not to get confused when something is unclear; and that the character names displayed in the various game menus and in all game modes should not be the same character if it's an entirely different player.

After you've gotten your bearings, please head to the Main Menu (Press ESC/Q to open the Main Menu) and head to the 'Quick Start' section. (Press Q a couple times to get your cockpit oriented). This screen provides you with a quick overview of your current ship and provides instructions on your first few matches, as well as a detailed tutorial for basic gameplay. When you reach the end of it, you'll be ready to start your first match.

Gameplay

There are two main forms of gameplay in EVE: Valkyrie:

Single Player gameplay is what you'll be playing in your first few matches. Once you reach the end of the tutorial and have the basic game knowledge down, there's a full game environment you can learn/play against other players in. These can also be found in the Tutorials, as well as on the Main Menu.

Multi-player gameplay is what you'll be playing when you join and play a match as a team against other teams. This includes all of the tutorials you could have followed during your first few matches, and you can find your team as well as find the match lobbies on the Main Menu.

Each team has a unique objective for the match. For example, in the tutorial (and in the tutorial lobby in the game), a friendly unit fights off an enemy force that's using a stealth bomber that drops an EMP device to disable friendly units. In a multi-player match, for example, each team has a unique objective and the goal of the match could be in any direction.

Teaching

You're in for a real treat after you finish playing a multiplayer match. If you have to teach new players anything in one match, you might want to consider taking out a few ""noobgies,"" or new players who just don't know the different parts of the game. The noobgies get to fly with real pilots that have flown the game for years. They are in"

"The New York Times has ""an astonishingly long list of responsibilities"" they have to the nation. We're not talking just about what our newspaper's role is on this Earth. We're talking about what we owe as citizens of the world.

We are now in a war with ISIS. We're engaged in a major offensive against the jihadist organization in Iraq and Syria. We're fighting two wars simultaneously, with a third war against ISIS to come. And we are, as a nation, committed to winning (or preserving) those wars.

So the first responsibility of the Times is to the people of the world. The second responsibility is to the people of the United States.

And what does the New York Times do?

In the lead-up to the Iraq War and with the military conflict going on in Syria, the Times has been out of touch with the people of the United States. That's why they are so out of touch with the American people and the mainstream media generally.

The Times, as a leading newspaper with a global reach and reputation, is part of the problem.

The Times has been out of touch with the American people for some time. There have been many examples of Times reporters who have taken the time to learn about the country they are embedded in. But the Times has largely retreated from American life.

"When I first started my career as a writer I worked as an editor and proofreader, which in a way made me a teacher and a mentor to a lot of other people. When I started writing for comics a few years later, I felt that I was on a career crossroad. I went from editing comic books and doing storyboards, to working for a publishing house and doing comics art, to becoming an editorial writer to working in Hollywood.

A lot of people ask me why I went back to doing writing for comics. It's not that I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the writing I did at my previous gig, what it's about it is the experience and connection—the relationship that I made with the comics in a medium that I don't normally talk to anymore. One of what I enjoy most is how far comics have come in a short time-span—and in that respect it's one of the places I can be close with creators, writers, and artists. As a writer, it makes me wonder, ""How far have my stories developed, how far will they go, and can they go on for ever?""

That's why I wanted to work with Sean Ryan on his book. As a former editor I know I shouldn't be surprised that his comic book work is of such quality, but seeing his pencils and inks, the way he draws the characters, the storyboarding, the way he brings emotion—I can't say enough about it. I was always a fan of his work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and The Vampire Diaries, but I never really expected him to make my book.

What's the biggest difference between editing and editorial? I think the editorial aspect is just knowing your subject matter inside-and-out so you're well aware of what your job is and how you have to get what you want done. Sometimes things happen too fast and you have to go through and pull a lot of stuff and make sure it's what you want. Editing is just writing again, but it's a lot more intimate and intimate art; there's a lot of work you have to do with everybody. But you can go beyond that. For example, I've been working with Sean's editor Alex Brown. It's easy with editorial, you know the subject matter inside-and-out, but I always tell my artists, ""You have to make your own decisions, you think of ways of making something good, like ""Hannibal"" for example.""

As a writer, what is your biggest influence? I think my major influence is Robert Crumb. I love his stuff, it's got all the good qualities, but he's also a crazy guy! He has these incredible paintings of black kids in their underwear that he's done in the past, and he made a living doing that. But he does it for his own pleasure, he has no business drawing these kinds of pictures"
"""It is unfortunate that the Democratic Party is being eaten alive by the Sanders wing of the party and President Obama's ideology of comprehensive amnesty for illegal aliens. The Republican Party must not be left behind,"" said Mireya Solís, the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. ""The Republican Party must take a principled stand against the mass immigration that is taking place."""
"You are a great man, but I can't help but feel that you're not a great friend. What can I do to help you achieve your dreams?

This is a tough one – it's like asking someone to be a better musician, or a better student, or a better father. The answer is probably not straightforward – and that's a damn good thing! Because if someone's goals are so great that they require great effort from the friend, I'm not going to stand in their way, and I never will.

I have my own set of expectations for the other four boys here, in terms of what they should be able to accomplish as adults. I expect that they will become men who contribute to the community in a meaningful way, with no regrets or lingering feelings of guilt. I want my sons to have the skills and motivation to be good and useful citizens and to build a solid and thriving economic future.

But there are plenty of kids out there who could do those things. And there are lots of others who won't, and who will regret that fact for the rest of their lives.

Why? Because the reality of the world remains the exact same today as it was when my generation was born. And that means that there are plenty of people out there who are not worth looking up to today, because they lack the skills and motivation to succeed. It means that people of power still get away with what they do, which is no fault of their own. It means that people who think they've got it made, who think that what they did is so unique and precious, can still keep doing it, and so keep thinking that there are no consequences attached to their actions. And that really does suck.

I know those are difficult times for parents, and for kids, and for most people in any age group. But it's never too late."
"""A lot of fans are going to be a little bit disappointed,"" said Matt Tait. ""The decision makes sense, but you have to go with your gut as a coach and for us it is not really in our favor, we need to be better on the road.""

Matt Tait had been part of the Montreal defense in every game until that point this season. Playing left back, Tait had been used as the team's primary set piece taker, most often when the red and white had the ball at the defensive end in the midfield. In fact, in Montreal's past two games, they had played two games using a 4-4-2 with a true right back, as Laurent Ciman, Karl Ouimette and Maxime Crépeau had all been used at right back in these two games. The last time that there was to be a change to the starting back four on a weekly basis was against the Chicago Fire on September 18, 2012, when Crépeau returned to the lineup.

""You always have to be flexible in coaching,"" said Tait. ""It's always a little bit tough for a group when you have to change things up and see how you play. But it's one of those decisions that you try to look at for the good of the team and you try not to look at the good of the team when you don't have a full team, but you do look at the bad of the team.""

Montreal began the 2013 season off with a 2-1 defeat at home to a Houston Dynamo side that featured a very impressive combination of striker Will Bruin, left wingers Kofi Sarkodie and Owen Coyle, and midfielder Ricardo Clark. Montreal's inability to generate any sort of offense from its defensive midfielders left the home side with a very high work rate when it wasn't controlling the ball on the counter.

The Impact's defensive problems were evident in their game against the Houston Dynamo on Saturday. ""We were not able to find the goal we wanted, especially down the middle at the end. The other side of that is they gave us a lot of confidence going into Houston and we knew that we would have to get forward at some stage,"" said Tait. ""Those two goals, we did manage to get them at some point in the game but not in the correct situations.""

The first goal came late in the game, when Dwayne De Rosario sent it into the upper corner past Tait. The second came just before halftime when a Houston Dynamo right back, DaMarcus Beasley, attempted to beat goalkeeper Troy Perkins inside the 6 yard box, but he couldn't quite get to the striker. Tait, however, was able to get a hand on the ball and the rebound was met by Ciman, who headed it in for the first goal.

The goal was the first of six Montreal conceded in the second half"

"I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure there's at least one person in this world that can't stand to see a man wearing a ""00"" tattoo.

But some of us are just plain weird assholes.

Via The Daily Mail:

A man in Japan has been arrested after allegedly wearing a '00' tattoo on his arm, for which he was arrested, according to reports.

The tattoo, which reads '00' in ink, was discovered on the man's body by a waitress in the restaurant he was dining in, according to the online news site Nippon News Network.

Unfazed, the man reportedly went on to order his next meal while more police officers were called to the scene to arrest him.

A spokesperson from the local police department told the website that the man's tattoo was a'security concern,' but did not elaborate on the nature of the tattoo.

It is unclear whether the man will face any charges, but it is clear that his tattoo has been a source of controversy for some time.

The man's tattoo is not the first to cause a stir in Japan.

A man in the country is currently being sued for $150,000 for allegedly writing '004' on his body with a permanent marker.

His lawyer, however, claims the man was merely trying to draw attention to the fact that he couldn't afford to pay the bills."

But he added that he is ""certainly going to be the best that, that I can be.""

""I would like to think that I'm a good teammate, I'm very involved,"" his teammates said after the ceremony Wednesday at the American Legion Hall in downtown Pittsburgh, where Bironas made his NHL debut in 2003 and started with the Penguins before being shipped to the Ottawa Senators.

Bironas, 30, was at the game Thursday night in his hometown of Pittsburgh and had a chance to celebrate with his family. But after he left the arena late Wednesday night, word spread that he hadn't shown up for his appearance at the ceremony.

So it was with great relief that he returned to find his locker unsecured, as had been the case for weeks. Bironas made the trip to the hospital Wednesday with no sign of trouble, but he was found lying unresponsive inside his locker.

Bironas was ""very alert"" when he was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead Tuesday evening, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office said.

Bironas was a native of Sibiu, Romania, and played six seasons with the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Senators. He spent most of his career playing alongside Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin and, despite only being 35, made his NHL debut in 2003 and played his last career game in 2011. He also scored two goals with 12 assists in 438 NHL games.

Bironas' death marks the second Penguins player to die this week. Chris Kunitz, a 25-year-old captain who scored 12 goals in 57 games for the Penguins this season, has died of complications from a severe asthma attack in his sleep at his offseason home in Florida, the team said. His death was classified by the Penguins as ""complications of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.""

""I am saddened by the death of Chris Kunitz,"" Penguins General Manager Ray Shero said in a statement. ""This is a devastating loss for our hockey family and our most dedicated fans. Chris will be remembered as one of the most popular players we've ever had in our organization and will forever be in our hearts.""

The Penguins had not announced an injury or illness as a result of Kunitz' death and said they were reviewing their training and practices with respect to their future schedule.

In addition to Kunitz, Penguins center Evgeni Malkin, forward Pascal Dupuis and defenseman Olli Maatta all announced their illnesses Wednesday and were released from the hospital earlier Thursday."

"The story about how a team of scientists in China found that people with an inherited gene that causes the immune system to attack tumors and cancer cells have dramatically shortened their lifespan is making headlines again this week. According to The New York Times:

A group of Chinese researchers reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Thursday that a variant of a gene called BRAF was linked to lower levels of survival during the first 10 years of healthy life. People carrying that variant had half the normal number of cells in their blood and much less effective immune systems — the very sort of vulnerability that might increase the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

But this story was originally published in 2014, and has never really gotten the attention it deserves. The paper was in Science, as well as in Science Translational Medicine, with the New York Times story being a reprint of the 2014 Science article. As a result, some readers have concluded the story is a rehash of an earlier study about how people with a related gene known as BRCA1 affect their health. The story, however, suggests that the results could be relevant for the way doctors care for cancer patients."
"The Grim Reaper is at it again, sending a group of messengers to the Isle of Masks, just in time to watch a trio of teenagers get killed by the angry spirits of the last place they saw a laugh, and the last place they saw a smile.

A few weeks ago, we ran our first Grim Reaper story, in which we weren't entirely sure what to expect when the Grim Reaper showed up. In the end, he delivered an unexpected treat: a kid who had kids who had kids who had kids and so on, all the way to the very end.

And the Grim Reaper's arrival wasn't the strangest thing to happen to the Isle of Masks. There was a time when flying cars and automated burger-flipping machines didn't exist, and no one suspected that a local murder could be a cause of that. But now, a nine-year-old girl has become a serial killer with plans to eliminate all her classmates. She's got a plan: She's going to find out why they laugh.

Leah is a kid who doesn't take it very well when other kids laugh at her. She knows, of course, that she shouldn't laugh, that it makes her sad, and that she should be ashamed of herself for doing it. But every time she does, she tells herself that she's just being silly, or that it's just how her classmates laugh.

One day, however, a gaggle of children starts laughing hysterically right in front of Leah, and she can't help but laugh along with them. She knows that she shouldn't laugh, and yet she does. And right in front of her, the victims start to laugh again.

Leah's dad, Tom, seems to be the only one who notices. He's never been the type to take things too seriously, but he knows that his daughter needs help. He asks her to help him look for the cause of the laughs, but no matter how hard she tries, she can't seem to find any answers. She's not able to understand why school is so awful, why her friends are mean to her, or why no one seems to care whether she lives or dies.

It's only when Tom realizes that Leah's been making her own jokes, that she starts to comprehend what's happening. The jokes have been slowly killing her classmates. They're making her sick, and she's only making the jokes worse. Tom's tried everything until he's convinced that she needs help, but he can't find any other solution.

Eventually, Leah finds herself faced with a decision: She can either go to school and try to get the laughs stopped, or she can walk away from it all and live with her parents in the Isle of Masks. She decides to try to stop the laughter, and she sets out to find the cause of the laughs by looking for the people who"
"Wang, who was appointed to the post by the late Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2011, has been tasked with reducing the country's wealth gap and improving the quality of life for ordinary people.

His first task is to overhaul the country's tax system, which has been criticized for the high rates of tax evasion and avoidance.

The Tax Administration Law, drafted by Wang, allows the government to collect a share of income tax on individuals' personal assets and income, but it has also been criticized for being overly complex and difficult to administer.

Under the new law, the government will collect taxes from individuals' assets, including their car and home. This will encourage people to focus on their own financial security and reduce the incentive for them to keep money offshore.

The tax will not be collected on her personal assets, but on assets ""related to business activities,"" which include shares in companies, stocks or property.

The government will also collect taxes on income from shared assets, such as cars and homes, and will tax income on capital gains.

The law also includes a provision for taxing income in cases of ""unreasonable"" deductions and loopholes, and the income tax rate on top incomes is set at 25 percent.

The new law also requires that all personal taxes be paid before the end of the year, rather than the end of the calendar year.

The new law also bans the use of scams and loopholes to avoid paying taxes, and will help the government to collect taxes on the assets of criminal groups and organized crime.

The tax collection agency will also begin employing ""radical transparency mechanisms"" to verify and verify the tax returns of individuals, and will require all self-employed individuals to work for the government for at least two years.

""We will use tax rules to strengthen the government's ability to collect taxes,"" Wang said.

Wang also announced a series of measures aimed at reducing wasteful expenditure, such as a ban on wasteful spending, which is already in place in other countries.

The new law will also require the government to disclose the total value of assets in all public companies, which will help the government allocate the necessary funds to pay for public services.

The new legislation also allows the government to collect taxes on land purchases, and the government will also begin collecting taxes on a portion of the value of the purchase price.

The government will also collect taxes on the construction of new buildings, and will collect taxes on the purchase cost of land.

Also, the government will create a system of tax rates for farmers who grow rice, wheat and barley, and will allow the government to collect taxes on rice and wheat crops.

The government will also create a system of taxes on the sale of domestic and imported luxury goods, and will allow the government to collect taxes on the sale price of luxury goods.

Wang also announced on Wednesday that the"
"How many times have you been told that you have high cholesterol? It's pretty easy to figure out how many, but why do we still hear this? It's an important question because the medical approach used to measure cholesterol is the lipid hypothesis, according to which coronary heart disease or its causes is caused by buildup of cholesterol in the blood. The lipid hypothesis is also known as the Framingham study; its founders were heart disease experts Robert Tromey and Arthur Young.

In the 1970s Tromey and Young became familiar with the fact that the Framingham Heart Study data showed that people who started on cholesterol-lowering drugs were healthier than those who didn't, leading them to theorize that cholesterol was just one element, in a larger spectrum of ""bad"" hormones and other factors, that can promote disease. However, that was just a hypothesis, and so neither of them had been able to prove it empirically.

That changed in 1981, when scientists from Framingham and from the International Agency for Research on Cancer began collaborating on a study of people with coronary heart disease and cancer. They compared the people who remained under their usual treatment with those who began treatment. In fact, the people who were under treatment had a higher incidence rate of both disease and death.

By the 1990s, it was clear that cholesterol had something to do with the disease. Although some suspected that it might be in the form of triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood. Other theories, such as that it might be in the form of phospholipids or that it was an oxidizer of the linoleic acid in animal fats, were not consistent with other research.

So Tromey and Young proposed in 1992 that elevated cholesterol was caused by free radicals, which are reactive oxygen species (ROS) whose main effect is to oxidize. They proposed that elevated cholesterol somehow caused free radicals and that these free radicals, which are formed by oxidizing other substances and which can attack DNA, cause an imbalance of these substances in the membranes and blood cells of the cells that produce cholesterol and LDL, the lipoprotein that causes coronary heart disease.

This is also where their relationship to the lipid hypothesis changed: The lipid hypothesis was founded by Robert Tromey and Arthur Young to account for the findings; the free radical theory was built upon these findings.

Tromey explains their decision to focus on free radicals in their book ""The Framingham Heart Study: A Scientific and Social Perspective."" Tromey explains how the cholesterol hypothesis could be disproved.

Tromey: As Dr. Young and Dr. T. Colin Campbell (founder of the Campbell diet at Harvard University) pointed out to us, this is a pretty difficult problem to solve. In fact, it's a rather simple problem. In fact, Dr. Young and Dr. Campbell said, well the only thing we can do to solve the problem is"
"On the night of November 8th, I posted a link on Twitter to a story by Politico's Dylan Byers that reported that the Trump campaign had begun preparing for a potential shutdown of the federal government. I highlighted the fact that I had been writing a book about the shutdowns of 1995-1997, and that the phrase ""shutdown"" is still mentioned in the book.

A few minutes later, I got a note from a friend who works for a small media outlet in New York City. He wrote: ""I have been wondering if you could tell me what happened to the book you mentioned? Is it still a potential best seller?""

I didn't know what to say. I assumed that Trump had started a book deal with me, and could be reached at my email address, @eric_p_wallace. I wrote back to say: ""Sorry, I was just thinking about what a lame thing that is for a writer to do. If you are wondering about my book, it's still a possibility, but there are no specifics at this time.""

The friend wrote back: ""I have been doing a lot of research on you and your book. I am not interested in the shutdown stuff. Just wondering if it is still a book? I did see a reference to it in the news. It was a story about a lawsuit, and the headline was 'Trump's book plan won't stick'.""

As I read the article, I was dumbfounded. I couldn't believe that someone could think that I have a book deal. I could not believe that someone would think that I had any interest in Trump.

I couldn't believe that I was being quoted as saying that I would be interested in a book from Trump.

I couldn't believe that I was being quoted as saying that I would be interested in a book from Trump. I was stunned. I had thought that Trump was my biggest competitor. But a Politico article? My life has been turned upside down.

I tried to convince the friend that I wasn't interested in a book from Trump at all. I told him that I was excited about the prospect of writing a book about the 1995-1997 shutdowns that led to the creation of the modern government shutdown. I told him that I had already written the book and that I was not interested in a book about Trump.

The friend emailed back: ""I think you are being deceptive. I'm not sure what is up with that tweet. I don't know if you don't know or you are just being brainwashed. I just want you to know that I talked to a lot of people who know you and have never heard you say that you are interested in a book from Trump. I'm not saying you are lying or anything.""

"A man was caught on video assaulting an elderly woman who was selling tea outside a McDonald's in South Korea. (Published Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2016)

A man who allegedly assaulted a woman selling tea outside a McDonald's in South Korea was arrested Tuesday, according to local police in the U.S., who shared video of the attack on social media.


The woman is filmed walking out of a fast food restaurant in Ulsan City as the man approaches her and accuses her of selling ""black"" goods.

After a brief argument, the man punches the elderly woman in the face, and she falls backward, landing on her back. The other man intervenes and the two men push and punch each other as they continue to fight.

The video quickly went viral, and a crowd gathered in support of the victim.


""He didn't say or do anything bad,"" said Kim Jong-soo, a witness of the incident and mother of two. ""But he attacked her first. She is 100% responsible for getting hurt.""

The man was arrested on charges of assault by beating and property damage. His identity has not yet been released.

Police are investigating the incident and said no other suspects remain at large.

"As a follow up to my post about the data, I wanted to investigate the relationship between the weights of the Buddhist deities and their creatures. So I started with the Deity-Creature Weight Chart from Wikipedia, which lists the weights of the creatures as of the year 2004.

I then calculated the weights of each Buddhist deity and the creatures that are part of the Dalai Lama's retinue.

For the sake of this post, I have removed some of the followers and the followers of the Dalai Lama, which further reduces the total number of followers.

The weights of the deities and their followers are then plotted on a graph. I marked the values with arrows (x,y). The blue arrows mark the weight of the Dalai Lama's followers, while the green arrows mark the weight of the deities.

The following graph shows the relationship between the weights of the deities and their followers.

The graph tells a clear story: The weights of the deities decrease as the number of followers of the deity increases. The relationship is linear and also non-monotonic.

Before I explore the details of the relationship, I thought I would show a small plot of the relationship using a different scale.

For the sake of comparison, here are the weights of the deities and their followers plotted at a logarithmic scale.

Initially, I thought the relationship was non-linear (because it seemed so) but upon further consideration, I conclude that the linearity is not statistical. In other words, the relationship with a logarithmic scale is not due to a strong correlation, but is a statistical artifact.

The logarithmic plot is more revealing, because it indicates that there is a strong inverse relationship between the weights of the deities and their followers. The inverse relationship is strongly non-monotonic.

The following figure depicts the relationship between the weights of the deities and their followers for the above scale.

The following figure shows the relationship between the weights of the deities and their followers for a scale of 1.

The following figure shows the relationship between the weights of the deities and their followers for a scale of 10.

"""The best way to deal with Donald Trump is to make him pay dearly so the American people don't have anything to distract them from the real issue. The real issue is that he is not fit to be the president of the United States. He is a danger to the republic."" ""I am not a Democrat or a Republican. I am an American first. I reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton and the arrogance of the bully with a Twitter account.

That's what former President Jimmy Carter has been saying about his fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton, saying that Trump is a threat to American society.

Carter said,

""The idea that a demagogue could be elected by millions of Americans is unthinkable to most people. And here we are with Donald Trump, promising more ignorance and divisiveness than any other candidate in history.""

""I feel bad for the rest of my country, not just the people of Georgia today, but everyone in the world today that is threatened or that is affected by the rise of this demagogue-who will not apologize for saying whatever he feels like and getting away with it.

He added,

""The best way to deal with Donald Trump is to make him pay dearly so the American people don't have anything to distract them from the real issue. The real issue is that he is not fit to be the president of the United States. He is a danger to the republic.""

"A former employee of Facebook is suing the social network for unpaid wages over a failed attempt to recruit him in 2010.

Brian Blau is seeking millions of dollars because he was an ""unemployed, unpaid employee"" of Facebook. He claims that his contract with the online company expired on May 30, 2010, and that because Facebook did not hire him prior to that date the employee was entitled to have his wages.

Since June 2010, Blau says he has received more than 12,000 text messages and e-mails from Facebook. Blau claims that the company has not paid him in over 4,000 cases, causing him a substantial amount of stress and emotional harm.

Read more about Brian Blau's lawsuit here.

In a press release sent to ABCNews.com after Blau filed the lawsuit Friday, Michael Cramer, an attorney with Cramer & Associates, said that a judge dismissed his client's original claim of unpaid wages last December for ""failure to state a claim.""

Cramer told ABCNews.com that Blau never formally requested to be paid. He said that because social media companies like Facebook are increasingly relying on freelancers for tasks like web design and content management, it is increasingly difficult for ""entire employees"" to stand up for what they are owed.

In a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said that Blau didn't ask for a settlement of his case and that it is reviewing his allegation.

""Facebook is a company where everybody understands the role we play in building communities through connecting people,"" said Facebook spokeswoman Erin Egan. ""We believe it's fair that employees get paid a fair wage. We've said this repeatedly for years: It is not our practice to deny employees overtime hours. If somebody has worked a certain amount of hours and they haven't been paid for that time, our policy is to pay them.""

In his complaint Blau also takes issue with Facebook's new policy. Under the new guidelines, all employees are required to have their hours reviewed each year, so that companies can know about any unpaid hours that occur.

But Blau does not believe that policy affects his situation.

""That's a very unusual and unique way to compensate employees. If Facebook was doing it, that would have been the same thing,"" he said.

Facebook's paid time off policy is called ""Work Opportunity,"" and gives users between 12 and 35 hours of paid time off each year. That has been reduced from the original 36 weeks in 2010.

Facebook also provides a weekly overtime policy, with 20 hours per week on average. However, that does not cover part-time workers, and employers are still responsible for paying full time employees more than 40 hours per week."
"ROME (Reuters) - Italy has said it has ""no intention"" of acceding to International Monetary Fund demands that it cut its budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product this year, in an apparent rebuke to the fund.

A view shows several Italian banks in the financial district in Rome June 12, 2013. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi

The new government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said on Saturday that it would not agree to the IMF's latest set of economic reforms, which include cutting the budget deficit to 3.0 percent of GDP by 2018, before a review by a special committee of the IMF governing board.

""We want the fiscal consolidation we need to consolidate the banking sector and the economy, and to do so in a way in line with European rules,"" Renzi said in a statement to the media, adding that he would submit to the IMF a set of reforms by the end of the year.

On Thursday, the IMF said that Italy's deficit of 3.05 percent of GDP in 2014 was ""widely expected"" and that a rise in the deficit this year would not be harmful to growth.

Italy's economy is under pressure from the collapse in the euro zone's second-largest economy and its failure to come up with substantial reforms.

Renzi's government had said it would not accept any cuts in the budget deficit that would mean a cut in the size of the public sector, which would have an impact on the economy.

The new government's failure to embrace the IMF's reforms, which are designed to make it easier for governments to cut their budgets, is a blow to the fund. The IMF's board meets in Washington next week.

The analysis by the IMF, published on Friday, said Italy's budget deficit would fall to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2015 and 1.6 percent in 2016, but said this would be a result of a ""very modest"" increase in public investment and a ""more modest"" rise in social spending.

The IMF said that Italy's economic recovery had been ""substantially less negative than expected"" in the first quarter, but added that the economy's progress would be ""inconsistent with a rapid turnaround"" in the second quarter.

""The economy is expected to pick up in the second quarter and to return to a growth trajectory that is consistent with the budget deficit target,"" the IMF said.

Renzi won a comfortable victory over Democratic Party candidate Pier Luigi Bersani in May's general election. The former Prime Minister and Democratic Party leader, who is now the leader of the centre-left opposition party, Renzi is hoping to form a government.

The IMF said it had ""no intention"" of cutting its forecast for global growth in 2015 and 2016."
"This week, a team of about 100 security researchers from the University of Washington, Google, and Samsung are releasing new research that shows that Samsung's latest flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy S5, have been sending data to servers located in China.

The researchers have been able to prove that the data being sent to servers in China is not encrypted, though it may be encrypted for some of the servers, says Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.

""The new information that the researchers have released today shows that the data that the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy S5 are sending to servers in China can be decrypted by anyone with access to the Internet,"" Soghoian says.

Samsung's devices have been found to send information to servers in China

Samsung is not the only smartphone manufacturer that has been found to send data to servers in China. Apple has also been found to be sending data to servers in China.

The data being sent to servers in China is almost certainly not encrypted on the phone, says Paul Kocher, principal security researcher at Kocher Group. ""By default, it's encoded as AES256,"" Kocher says.

This particular case of a data being sent to servers in China makes sense, because it is a Chinese company, Oppo, that is making the phone. ""If you're Chinese, and you have a Chinese phone, it's probably in the best interests of the phone manufacturer to transmit information for security reasons in China,"" Soghoian says.

The new research has raised questions about the security of the devices, which have been found to not encrypt data when they are being sent to Chinese servers. Data sent to China is also subject to Chinese law, so the researchers are concerned that the data might be intercepted by Chinese authorities.

The researchers have also found that Samsung's ""secure mode"" to encrypt data sent to servers in China seems to be disabled when the device is run in ""air-gapped"" mode, which means that the device is not connected to a computer or network at all. ""Air-gapped mode shows a lot of the security features missing from the Galaxy S5 and S5 Edge,"" Soghoian says.

Samsung has not responded to a request for comment on the new research. Samsung declined to comment on the research when contacted by The Verge.

The researchers have released a set of tools that can be used to test whether the phone sending data to a server in China is running in air-gapped mode.

Update, May 16th, 12:52PM ET: Samsung has responded to the research and published a blog post on the issue. It says that the research is ""misleading"" and that the Galaxy S5 ""does not transmit any data to a third party server."" It adds that the ""secure mode"" feature is turned"
"HELSINKI—Three years after the horsemeat scandal at one of the world's biggest food companies, Finland's top meat and dairy regulator is recruiting an army of scientists to help it detect and solve future scandals.

Finnish food safety officials are calling for more scientists to help them fight food-borne illnesses, including the long-awaited recall of horsemeat found in frozen beef lasagna. ( JONATHAN NACKSTRAND / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )

A new hiring drive, announced Monday in Finland, aims to add a total of more than 400 scientists to the Food Safety Authority of Finland — the country's food regulatory agency — by 2018. ""The problem of food safety has become much more complex, and we need to do everything possible to protect consumers,"" said Jussi Karlsson, chief of the authority. ""We want to see more people working here, in order to be able to combat food safety issues.""

Karlsson, who took over as chief last summer, said the agency is seeking people who can work in a collaborative manner, including working on case studies and developing new technologies. ""We need people who can work with companies, who can work with international partners,"" he said. ""We need people who can work across borders, who can work with other countries' food safety authorities."" The agency's call for scientists came amid renewed public concern about the safety of products from major food companies, including Kraft, Nestle, Unilever and McDonald's. The horsemeat scandal that emerged in January 2014, when McDonald's admitted it had used horsemeat in its French fries, prompted several other major food companies to admit they had also been using horsemeat in their products. The scandal prompted the European Food Safety Authority to issue a recall of horsemeat from some processed food products. It has since prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to confirm it is investigating similar allegations.

The Finnish food safety agency has also been working to improve food safety in a country that imports more than 90 per cent of its food. Last year, it developed a program to identify and test products for harmful bacteria, including E. coli, salmonella and campylobacter.

Karlsson said the agency has also been working to improve the country's food safety laws and regulations. ""We have been working on reforming the food safety laws and regulations. We want to make sure we have the right legislation to protect citizens and the environment,"" he said. The food safety agency won't say where the new scientists will be hired, but according to the Finnish news agency STT, it is likely to be a foreign university.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great camera! I bought this camera to use for landscape and nature photography. It has a wide aperture and a great LCD screen, and a built-in flash. I used the 200mm lens on the 17-55mm and it produced some fantastic images. It's very sturdy, too. I took it out to a beautiful lake with bright sunshine and it still handled it like a champ. I am very pleased and highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a good, lightweight wide-angle camera.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great camera for the price I bought this to replace a Canon 5D Mark III and I am happy I did. I am using it on a B&H Discover Card and it is perfect. I used it for sports, wildlife, nature, portraits and just about anything you can imagine. The screen is bright, and I like that the EVF has a minimum focusing distance of about 6 feet. I have a Canon 5D Mark III and I love it, but I am very happy with this camera.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great camera for the price The B+W 17-55mm 2.8 is a great camera. The fast f/2.8 aperture works well for indoor and outdoor use, with the ability to focus very close and capture a great composition. The built-in flash is a great feature that can be used for portraits or to help in low-light situations. I had hoped that the lens would be a little longer due to the longer focal length, but I find that the lens is very usable for landscapes and indoor.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great camera for the price I bought this to use in a wedding. I got it for the price, so one could say it's a steal. I don't use this for a lot of purposes. It is great as a very basic point and shoot, but highly recommend this camera for its price range. I use it mostly for pictures of the bride and groom, both of which are still fairly small. The flash works well, but the focal length is a bit longer than I would like, and I would prefer a 2x zoom. However, the battery life is great, and the camera comes with a lot of flexibility."
"Hangover-y. And then they come back with more.

You know the thing where those crazy chicks who have a night out on the town but then immediately become slobs when they sit down and drink again?

That usually happened with the ""The World's Most Famous Bikini Body"" models back in the '80s, right? If so, it looks like those people are going to have a lot more opportunities to experience that type of phenomenon in 2014, because the next step up in American society, that we all assume is the highest status one, is being recognized as a real living, breathing human being once again.

This week, the US Patent and Trademark Office published a series of new trademarks for the word ""lifer."" While the trademark application doesn't actually allow for the use or sale of certain products related to this term, we should probably probably assume that whoever submitted the application is a real estate agent, or a nurse, or a high school teacher.

The application description claims that the term ""lifer"" is an ""enhanced version of the term 'lifer.'"" So basically, now we can say that anyone who is not a 30-year-old virgin is, technically, a ""lifer.""

And it's not like the trademark itself is any fun or anything, because, by all rights, the term ""lifer"" should be an entirely negative term. But then again, that'd be too bad, since this trademark application is in the name of a company that makes clothing for women who aren't living that glamorous life. So then we know: This company sells clothing to people who have no idea what they're talking about.

We will have to wait a while to find out what the patent office thinks of women who aren't married, don't use birth control, and who don't consider themselves to be married; we'll find out if the ""lifer"" trademark actually means something when these names and products get used in commerce.

"There is a strong probability for a spark in the next few days. There is a chance for a volcanic eruption. There is no chance for a major earthquake.

This is the latest prediction from officials in the resort island of Tonga, where a volcano has been fuming for more than a week.

Tongan government officials told CNN that there is a chance of one or two small-scale eruptions within the next few days. They said a major eruption is unlikely.

A town near the volcano, called Laki, is experiencing very high levels of threat.

The Tongan government said in a statement that ""every precaution is being taken to protect the safety of the community from the volcano.""

""The evacuation of Laki and surrounding areas... is not expected for several weeks.""

The volcano, known in the local Tongan tongue as Pahoehoe, has spewed a large amount of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere.

The U.S. Geological Survey said there was a ""high likelihood"" for a small eruption in the next few days.

On Monday, a news report said the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Hawaii had issued a high level alert for the area around the volcano.

The volcano's last eruptions in 2009 and 2010 spewed ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, but no major explosions occurred.

Seismic activity has been increasing, with a tremor recorded at the volcano.

A series of smaller earthquakes has also been recorded near the volcano, which is about 400 miles southwest of Tonga's capital, Honiara.

The earthquakes started almost two weeks ago.

Tongan officials are urging people not to be alarmed, saying it is only natural for the volcano to be active."
"It's likely that the Los Angeles Lakers will have two change-of-scenery games in the next several years, one in Orlando, Florida, and the other in Las Vegas. The Orlando games will take place at the Amway Center, while the Las Vegas games will take place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

The teams will meet for the first time in Las Vegas on Dec. 10, 2017. The Lakers will travel to Orlando on Jan. 15, 2018.

According to a report by ESPN.com's Ramona Shelburne (via Twitter), the Lakers' decision to play in Las Vegas is due to the fact that it's closer to home and the team can see the practice facility of the Orlando Magic.

The Orlando Magic will move into the new Amway Center in 2017-18, and will need the extra space for their practice facility, which is operated by the Magic and is adjacent to the Amway Center.

While the teams have yet to officially announce the games, the Lakers have already been linked to the games, with Shelburne noting that ""the Lakers are believed to be the front-runners to host a preseason game in Orlando this season.""

The Lakers will have their annual training camp in August before beginning the regular season in October."
"Answer:

A:

Hi,


The video is a bit old, but you can still find lots of information about the subject. The original answer is quite long, so I have just broken it down into a few answers:


1. The most common cause of a broken screen is a bent or broken connector.

2. The screen itself can be damaged by water (although I have never seen it happen), which is why it is often recommended to use a screen protector.

3. The screen may crack if it gets wet.

4. The screen may crack if it gets very hot, to the point where the glass melts.

5. The screen may be damaged by chemicals and dirt.


When dealing with the above mentioned causes, you should take care to keep the screen dry. Water can cause the adhesive on the adhesive pads on the screen to get stuck to the screen, and this will then render the screen unusable. It is also easy to get water on the screen, and the screen protector may not protect the screen at all.


These steps should prevent you from getting any of the above mentioned problems:


1. Always get the screen protector on before you use the screen!

2. Always use the screen protector on a clean screen (without dirt or dust).

3. Use a screen protector with a very small amount of silicone (or something similar) on the back of the screen.

4. Use the protective sticker on the back of the screen protector.

5. Don't use the screen protector on a screen that is covered in other stuff (it will get stuck to it, and you will have to clean it off later).

6. The screen protector should stay on the screen for at least 5-10 minutes before you use it.

7. Don't hold onto the screen protector for too long, and don't use it until you are sure it is on the screen.


If you are still having problems, report it on the forum thread.


Sorry for the inconvenience."
"Meth is often associated with bad things. But many people use the drug recreationally, and there's no evidence it has any negative side effects. And some scientists are even calling the substance a health-promoting drug — something which is a little surprising given its reputation. But what exactly is meth, how does it work, and what are its health effects?

What is meth?

Meth is a highly addictive, chemically similar chemical to cocaine that's used to get high. The drug is not only illegal but also hard to find in the U.S., mainly because its precursor, methanidine, is hard to find, as it has been banned as an agricultural carcinogen.

Methamphetamine is a crystalline powder of a chemical called ephedrine, which comes from the ephedra plant plant (used in cold medicine, etc.). It's also a precursor of methamphetamine, but the two drugs have different structures. The key difference is that meth is a white powder which is usually ground into a fine white powder and mixed with water, whereas ephedrine is a brown powder, and so is harder to find.

Methamphetamine has a long and illustrious history, but there's really only one reason why it's so popular today: for being a stimulant. Users will often report that meth provides a huge buzz, and the drug often leads to short-acting and highly pleasurable highs. Many of these people use meth in much larger amounts (sometimes more than 25mg) with the belief that it's a safer substance and they won't go crazy or have ""crash"" episodes after.

The other reason why meth has gotten so popular is because of how it became popular again. In the 1970s, after being banned by the U.S. for being the cause of deadly heart irregularities, meth was recreationally used by many as a safe alternative to illegal drugs.

But while meth is a safe, non-addictive alternative to cocaine, scientists now believe that it's not all that safe for long-term use. This is because of its addictive properties. It's estimated that meth can create severe psychological effects, including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and even paranoia.

In fact, some studies suggest that the drug can cause serious damage to the human brain.

Some scientists are now calling the drug a health-promoting drug, as it's been shown to reduce smoking, cigarette addiction, and other associated social diseases. Other scientists, however, are less enthusiastic about meth's benefits. They believe methamphetamine is addictive from the same chemical source as cocaine, and the drug is likely to cause a number of long-term risks including: brain damage, heart attack, stroke, cancer, and early death.

So what do the risks come down to? Here's a quick guide to meth's negative effects.

Brain damage

As a stimulant, methamphetamine is known"

"I got a pretty good offer for a second game of the game. I've also bought at least one set of the starter deck I made, since I knew this would get lost somewhere and it really helped.

"A long-distance runner will be trying to improve his world record, set on the track in April 2012, when his attempt on the marathon comes up. The man in question will be David Millar, who set the world record at the 2010 London Marathon by over five hours. He plans to be competing by foot at the 2014 London Marathon. Millar also has another long-distance marathon goal in mind to reach at the 2014 London Marathon: one he hopes will eventually see him running the 2013 Boston Marathon.

David Millar has one thing on his mind. As a former professional who will be trying to raise some money for various charities during the event, he may not need every minute of every race.

But while Millar is not looking to put his mark on the world record books by doing several races at once, he may have just made the best use of his time at all in 2014.

Millar intends to enter the London Marathon in February, 2013, to try to improve on his current best of 2 hours, 40 minutes and 11 seconds, set in April 2012. Millar's goal is to break the course record held by British athlete Ian Thorpe, who ran 2:03:59 in 1994. Millar was hoping to break it during the 2012 London Marathon by beating fellow veteran Matthew Busche at 2:03:00 in Saturday's 26.2-mile race, but a race injury put him out of the running early. Millar's training will probably get him to the start, but he must be on the right fitness level. If he doesn't make it there, he'll probably try again in 2014.

Millar has another ambitious goal on his 2013 list as well. He wants to run the Boston Marathon, a goal he's made known on his blogs as early as May 12, 2012, before the race. Since Millar is not a professional professional in track, and has no training experience with running distance, the Boston marathon is perhaps the best goal Millar can have.

For Millar, having Boston to run is a no-brainer if he can't make it for the London marathon. It is a well-known course for professional athletes, so Millar might be able to run faster there and break the course record. In fact, one of Millar's friends from college once asked him why he never ran Boston in high school.

""What? I've never even gotten out of the gym,"" Millar said. ""Why wouldn't I run it? I would love Boston.""

Millar has made it sound pretty easy to be ready for February's marathon. He is trying to work out on the treadmill every day, and he still has five months before he must qualify for the world championships to participate in them. The fact that he isn't even training at a high level is likely a good indicator that Millar can indeed prepare well for February's marathon. After"

"Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau wrote an interesting piece in The New York Times. The title is ""The Birth of a Secular Judaism"" and if he writes his sentence too slowly you can hear the sound of a shofar blowing on Purim night. Rabbi Lau is the founding dean of Shalom Hartman Institute for Jewish Spirituality. As a rabbi he is a very busy person in the spiritual life of Americans, and as he states in the article, ""I've had rabbis ask me to put their writing on their website, and I've asked some of my students to serve as guest hosts for them on social media; I've been asked to translate and present their speeches; I've given lectures and have given public audiences, and I've done more, much, much more.""

And if you want to know more about Rabbis Lau, here is a video interview of him with Rabbi Chaim Elnitsky, ""When we teach our religious students, we want them to understand the halachos of their schools, their community, and their religious tradition to the letter. And that starts in a book that is the Bible – the Torah. … For this, the Rabbis of the Jewish people have made it very clear that it is better that a person not read the Torah in his lifetime than for him to commit a kiddush Hashevah, which means to read the Torah within the year of a person's birth.""

There is also a very useful book called The Torah Guide: A Guide for Spiritual Development that is published by Olim Chaim's Kollel of America. The editor is Rabbi Chaim Meir Lau. This is a book based on a new book called The Book of Kethubim from which it was adapted – an important spiritual and spiritual book in its own right – and it addresses both the Jewish and the non-Jewish side of kollel learning.

I wanted to share Rabbi Meir Lau's article, but instead of just paraphrasing it, I would like to explain what he is saying for readers who are familiar with religious texts written by rabbis such as Rambam, Chaim Kanievsky, and Rabbi Akiva Eliyahu-Fry, among others.

Rabbi Lau explains that a great blessing comes to Jews, for example, if their descendants are permitted to use the Torah for learning religious laws. In the case of the Torah, this is the Gemara, and Rabbi Lau explains, ""When Rambam learned about the Gemara, he learned about a certain Mishnah in it (i.e., the Mishnah of Jubaiah) that tells us that if a person has no obligation to observe shabbat in his lifetime, and he should give his Torah to Rambam (or another great rabbi if one in his community might be more knowledgeable), he can keep his Torah with him,"
"How to dress for a face-to-face meeting with a CEO

The best face-to-face meetings are the ones that you don't have to exert yourself. They allow you to take a break and recharge in a safe environment.

As a leader, you can help the company to succeed by meeting with your CEO in a way that amuses and entertains him.

There are many ways to do it, but here are some of the best:

1) Be funny

A good joke will always be a good topic for a meeting, and a great one can drive your CEO crazy.

2) Have a funny story

The CEO wants to hear how you're going to be different this time. You can tell him a fun story about a time when someone a little different found his way into your life.

3) Ask questions

When you ask a question, be sure you have a short answer and a long answer. It's not important that you know the answer to a question, but it's important that you know why you're there.

4) Ask ""what if"" questions

In your meeting, ask yourself if there is a scenario where your CEO would respond differently. This is a great way to get him thinking about how he would respond if the same thing happened again.

5) Practice small talk

When you sit in front of a CEO, you need to make small talk. It's normal to be interrupted by everyone, but small talk is the best way to avoid it.

6) Record your meeting

A great way to record your meeting is to use a recorder. Record what you say to your CEO, put it on a CD, and take it with you.

In the meeting, you can listen to the recordings on your computer or phone. If you're not comfortable with technology, there are recordings available at your company.

If you're not comfortable with recording or not having anything to check back on, you can also record a video of your meeting.

7) Go for a walk

When you're at a meeting, walking around is a great way to renew your mind. It's a good way to get your mind off your problems.

8) Play some music

The CEO likes to hear music. You can play something that he likes, or you can play something that you think will fit well.

9) Go to the beach

The CEO likes to go for a walk. You can go for a walk together, or you can go alone.

10) Bring a gift

You don't have to give your CEO a gift when you meet. You can give him a gift that you think he'll like.

11) Give a gift

You can give your CEO a gift that will make him feel appreciated. A gift that makes"
"A little more than eight years ago, I made my first foray into social network blogging. I spent the better part of a year learning the ropes and improving my ability to write articles. One of the biggest aspects I learned that night by far was how to find traffic.

For my blog posts, I set out to do the same thing; ""convert"" a few thousand views into real traffic by posting articles on a popular social news site. As I dug more into SEO and SEO, I looked at how the social media giant was doing on getting their users to their site.

I knew that by building a large following, the top results from Social Media Examiner (SME) would automatically be ranked higher in search, so I took advantage of the SEO tactics I would be working on in the future. That is, instead of focusing on my article, I spent an entire night of work on an article that had been written by a friend. That article made my friend, a business owner in Toronto, reach a new audience and boost his business.

A month after publishing that article, it was ranking higher than my article on MONEY.com, so I knew I had something here. When I started out, I had no idea what my traffic was doing. My biggest concern was whether my articles would be featured prominently on the search engine results page (SERP) or not. However, I was so caught up in trying to increase my content output on a short term basis that I had forgotten my initial goal of building traffic to my site.

Now I'm here, more than eight years later, and I'm ready to share with you how to build a successful Social Media blog. This post is a quick guide on how to do that.

Here's Why It Works

The first thing you need to understand is that there are two sides to every traffic coin.

First, there's your visitors. These users are the ones you want to reach.

Secondly, there are users and search engines looking for your keyword (your target). Search engines have their own goals, and while they aren't evil, they have to consider the other people searching for you too. For example, if your headline isn't good enough, there are plenty of people with good headlines competing to rank for your keyword.

A successful Social Media blog is going to meet some of these criteria.


It Will Reach People Who Are Interested in the Topic You're Blogging About


Many times, you can make your blog more accessible by adding search engine friendly content. A great way to do that is through the inclusion of Social Media keywords in the content you write.

This will give your readers a way to find you and easily connect with the type of content they're looking for.

You Should Provide Interesting Content Based on What Your Readers Say They Want to Read

"It seems that even though the US government is working to combat money-laundering through Bitcoin transactions, the government's recent warning that customers should be skeptical of Bitcoin transactions doesn't appear to have deterred people from putting their hard earned savings into altcoins.

According to Forbes, the number of Bitcoin transactions over the past couple of months is currently at a record high, with Bitcoin wallets now holding as many as 18 percent of all active Bitcoin addresses.

This is not the first time the US government has attempted to tackle Bitcoin. Back in June, the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission warned that individuals are ""not required"" to register with the Commission as a Bitcoin trader or exchanger, and also warned that Bitcoin exchanges and wallet services have been warned that they ""could be held liable for fraudulent representations and violations of the law.""

Nevertheless, despite the warning, the number of Bitcoin users has reached dizzying proportions. The majority of Bitcoin users still seem to be in the ""let's get rich"" mentality, and are buying Bitcoins with cash on their smartphones, and converting Bitcoin's into fiat currency. As a result, the market value for Bitcoin has rocketed in the recent weeks, with some analysts believing that it could be worth $20 billion, and some experts even predicting that Bitcoin could surpass gold as the currency of the future.

"A second American suspect has been arrested in the Boston Marathon bombing, the FBI said Friday.

The suspect, whose name has not been released, was arrested early Friday in Watertown, Mass., in a carjacking, the FBI said. He was taken to a hospital in ""grave condition,"" where he is being treated for gunshot wounds to his torso, the FBI said.

A source familiar with the investigation told CNN the suspect was a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older of the two brothers behind the bombings.

The FBI made the announcement about the second suspect after a press conference in New York, where U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the FBI is working with Boston's police department and other agencies in the investigation.

The second suspect is being held in an undisclosed location, Holder said. He was taken into custody in Watertown, Mass., in a carjacking, and his vehicle was found abandoned, he said.

The FBI said Tamerlan Tsarnaev remains under armed guard at a hospital and is being monitored by FBI officials.

""We're going to do everything we possibly can to verify his status as a victim of a violent crime and to work with him and his family to find him a safe place to go,"" Holder said.

The FBI said it has not yet determined whether the two suspects are related. The FBI said its Boston field office is leading the investigation with assistance from the Mass. Law Enforcement Commission and the Boston Police Department.

The FBI said it will be investigating if the suspects acted alone or if others were involved.

""For now, we want to thank the members of the Boston community for their outpouring of support and concern and the incredible work they're doing to support law enforcement and the victims of this tragedy,"" Holder said.

""We're going to continue to work together to support the victims, the families of the victims and the city of Boston in this challenging time.""

Police have not disclosed any information about the brothers, but they said they were wearing backpacks as they ran the marathon.

"MOSCOW (AP) – Russia's defense ministry is pushing to revive military-to-military cooperation between Russia and Belarus.

MOSCOW (AP) – Russia's defense ministry is pushing to revive military-to-military cooperation between Russia and Belarus.

Interfax Thursday quoted Alexander Grushko, press secretary with the Russian defense ministry, as suggesting ""a broad military cooperation cooperation plan"" on Thursday.

Grushko spoke ahead of a meeting of the Military-Political Council of Russia's Association of the South Caucasus Nations scheduled to take place in the Rostov region in northwestern Russia on Thursday.

The two countries will work together to improve the fight against terrorism and security challenges, Grushko said. Russia's military cooperation with Belarus includes a command center, a mobile communication system, communications and surveillance equipment and arms supplies, he said.

A Belarusian general also participated in talks on the sidelines of the meeting.

The Russian military cooperation between Russia and Belarus began in 2003. Belarus, for its part, has had a military-to-military cooperation agreement with Russia since 2004.

In August, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited both Belarus and Georgia to discuss military and security issues with his counterparts.

Putin told reporters Tuesday in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi that he believes military-to-military cooperation with Belarus will strengthen ties between the two former Soviet republics even further.

Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan signed a security cooperation program on Sept. 6 and a contract on the supply of arms and defense industry parts was signed in November. Russia pledged to provide military-technology supplies worth 3.5 million rubles ($54.8 million) a year — half of which should be for use in cooperation with Belarus. Kazakhstan pledged to provide defense parts worth 1.5 billion rubles for use in building the military base in Tashkent.

The plan includes military training, exercises and other events on Russian territory and cooperation in training the militaries of the three states.

Russia and Belarus signed a series of defense-related agreements in June 2013, which have so far been implemented."

"Peru's president has vowed to fight corruption, but his government faces increasing pressure to clean up its books before it hosts the FIFA World Cup.

José Guillermo Solís, who took office last month, has promised to hold an anti-corruption summit, introduce new laws and establish an anti-corruption commission.

But his pledges have been undermined by the government's erratic response to the biggest corruption scandal to hit the country in decades.

Last week, the government fired the head of FIFA's ethics committee after the committee condemned the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups for failing to tackle bribery and corruption.

The outcry followed a report by the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas (CNI) that detailed how the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups has been riddled with corruption.

However, the government has refused to hold the summit that Solís pledged to hold, instead sending the CNI's head, Ricardo Teixeira, to explain FIFA's decision.

The government team arrived in Lima with what appeared to be a list of demands, which were later withdrawn.

It includes opening investigations into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, as well as the participation of the Football Association of Peru (FAP) in the bidding process.

FAP's president, Nicanor Luis Chilavert, said he was not happy with the government's initial demands.

""The government is not listening to us. If they are not going to make the changes, we are going to continue to boycott the games,"" Chilavert said.

""We are not going to be part of the World Cup if we are not going to see the truth.""

Chilavert said that the government had already been in touch with FIFA about the demand to open an investigation into the bidding process, despite his organisation's opposition.

""They [FIFA] have told us that if we are ready to open an investigation, FIFA will let us,"" he said.

""We are not going to be part of the World Cup if we are not going to see the truth.""

Chilavert also criticised the guidelines that FIFA issued earlier this year which he said did not give FAP enough power to investigate any wrongdoing.

""The documents that FIFA gave us today are not very clear,"" he said.

""We have submitted a request for clarification but we have not received that from FIFA yet.""

FIFA's ethics committee said it would meet in Mexico next week to discuss the report and its recommendations.

Similiano Salinas, a member of the CNI and former director of the National Anti-Corruption Office, said that the government needed to do its own investigation into the bidding process.

The French air and sea forces have launched an operation to free a hostage in an attack by a self-styled Islamist militant group in north-western Mali, the president has said.

It did not give details of the hostage's location or the reason he was held.

Malian troops have been fighting an Islamist rebellion for more than a year.

Several African nations have sent troops and equipment to help in the operation.

French warplanes from an international effort have been bombing the Islamists since a rescue mission in February, after a car bomb attack on a hotel in the city of Sevare left at least 23 people dead.

But this is the first hostage-taking that was directly linked to the conflict there, a senior official source told AFP news agency.

'Innocent people'

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Tuesday's attack in Burkina Faso.

But President Blaise Compaore confirmed that ""it was a terrorist attack orchestrated by a terrorist group"".

He said the government was working closely with regional leaders to bring peace to Mali.

""I ask citizens, families and the public to continue to live with calm. To be vigilant and alert to any change in the weather. To be united to face the challenge we face,"" he said.

The security operation has been complicated by the presence of the al-Qaeda linked Ansar Dine and the Boko Haram Islamist factions that also operate along Mali's north-west border.

Mali's government confirmed that the three foreigners had been ""abducted"" but said it was not clear whether they had been taken hostage.

The official source told Reuters news agency that the two French nationals in their 50s and the Malian man were freed at the weekend, though reports suggest they may have already been taken to Timbuktu.

Mr Blaise Compaore's comments about the kidnapping came as French and Malian forces held a series of meetings on the outskirts of the capital, Bamako.

The foreign and military teams were on patrol to secure tourist sites in Gao and in several neighbouring regions.

They are patrolling in pairs and are taking no chances.

A senior Malian security official said the operation was ""at a very aggressive point'' with militants and bandits operating in the region."

It is no secret that the U.S. government wants to maintain Israel's military superiority over the Palestinians. But why are the U.S. and Israel so willing to continue to support the Palestinians?

The answer is that both countries are seeking to maintain the status quo.

When the U.S. and Israel are in conflict with the Palestinians, they are in conflict with the Arab world. The U.S. and Israel would like to maintain the status quo in the Middle East, which is one in which Israel is the dominant power, while the Palestinians are marginalized and oppressed.

The U.S. and Israel are also in conflict with the rest of the world, particularly the international community. The U.S. and Israel are in conflict with the international community, which is being led by America's main ally, the United Kingdom.

"A new study has found that more than half of all children worldwide have a chronic illness.

Researchers from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that more than half of all children in low- and middle-income countries are living with a chronic illness, such as asthma or diabetes.

The study, published in the medical journal The Lancet, used data from a longitudinal study of over 60,000 children born in Brazil, Chile, Peru, and the United States from 1991 to 2003.

""The survey data was taken from families in which at least one of the parents was either a physician, nurse, or health professional,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Rafael Chiriboga, from the Sanger Institute.

""These researchers found that children in the low- to middle-income countries had the highest prevalence of chronic diseases in the world, and that more than half of children have at least one chronic illness.""

The researchers noted that a number of factors have contributed to the global rise in chronic diseases, including poor diet and hygiene initiatives, which have contributed to the spread of infectious diseases.

""The results highlight the importance of measuring the burden of chronic diseases in children worldwide,"" the researchers wrote.

""Consequences of inadequate nutrition and hygiene, as well as the associated burden of disease, are particularly relevant to children living in low- and middle-income settings, where there are few resources and where many children lack access to health care.""

The prevalence of chronic diseases also differs between development settings. In developed countries, conditions like diabetes, asthma, and eczema are more common than in less developed countries.

The study was based on a large sample of children from the three countries, leading researchers to speculate that some children's health could be affected by ""confounding factors"" because of their surrounding environment.

""No matter where you are in the world, you need to remember the basic three rules of prevention of chronic diseases: preventable, under-recognized, and preventable,"" Dr. Chiriboga said.

""If you want to reduce the burden of chronic diseases, you need to improve the health of the people around you. This is a message that should resonate everywhere.""

"The following is a press release from the Piedmont Office of the Chief State's Attorney.

The Grand Jury of the 15th Judicial District issued its Indictment in the case involving Georgia Department of Public Safety Trooper-Pilot Kevin Michael Dunn and former Fulton County Sheriff's Deputy Daniel Willis, charging they used excessive force against Trayvon Martin under circumstances constituting abuse of public authority. An additional charge of felony murder was added to the charges of misdemeanor assault and battery. The Indictment is attached as the court files its statement of probable cause. We expect that the Grand Jury will issue its Decision on the charges in about 8-10 weeks after the evidence is presented to them.

The Indictment, which is attached here, charges that on August 26, 2012, the defendants used force and did the things which are alleged in the Indictment including, but not limited to, those that caused the victim's loss of life. This indictment is not a finding of guilt or innocence on the part of any of the defendants.

I also thank the community members and the members of law enforcement who worked so tirelessly and compassionately for this case throughout those two years,"" stated Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard.

"A group of U.S. senators is calling for the release of a former Guantanamo Bay detainee accused of plotting the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in East Africa.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight of the Pentagon, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is the subcommittee's ranking Republican member.

In a letter Wednesday to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, McCain and Graham say that the State Department should immediately approve the transfer of Majid Khan to the U.S. for trial.

The detainees at Guantanamo Bay have complained of being held in cages that are too small to accommodate their needs.

The letter cites the ""overwhelming evidence"" that Khan was a ""violent extremist"" who plotted to bomb U.S. targets in East Africa.

Khan was captured in Pakistan in May 2002 in the aftermath of the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. He has been held at Guantanamo Bay since 2002 without charge or trial.

The State Department has until August 1 to decide whether to approve the transfer of Khan to the U.S. or deny it.

The letter also says that the United States has failed to explain why it should not be held responsible for the 1998 embassy bombings, which killed 224 people and wounded more than 1,000.

""You have a responsibility to the American people to explain what the U.S. government knows about the deadly attacks and why it has yet to prosecute the perpetrators,"" the senators' letter reads.

Last year, McCain and Graham requested that the Obama administration provide detailed information about the 1998 bombings. They also asked the administration to report on its efforts to track down the masterminds of the bombings.

"The release of a medical marijuana dispensary in the West End of Vancouver has divided the city's residents.

Many of them wish the city had done more to prevent the dispensary from opening.

""It's not like we were really looking at it from an economic perspective,"" said Jim Hoey, a local resident. ""It's not a business, it's a distribution site.""

article continues below

Hoey had been having trouble finding a local dispensary, so he decided to go to the one in Vancouver, which is operated by a private company called Green Tree.

""The fact that they're open is part of the issue,"" he said. ""It's not like we're fighting the good fight here.""

The West End has a long history of drug activity, and the drug trade is known as the West End's ""dirty little secret.""

""We know Vancouver is the focus of the drug trade, and that's why the West End is so visible,"" said Kathy Leung, Vancouver's manager of strategic services.

Leung says there is a strong connection between the West End drug trade and drug trafficking around the country.

""There's a strong relationship between the Vancouver drug trade and the drug trafficking throughout Canada,"" she said. ""It's not just Vancouver.""

The dispensary is slated to open in the west end this week. Medical marijuana is legal in B.C., but the federal government has established regulations that limit the number of dispensaries in the country.

""It's not going to be a big impact on the Vancouver community,"" said Hoey. ""I'm sure it will be a problem for the rest of the city.""

While the dispensary will be open for business, the city is not allowing it to sell recreational marijuana.

""We will not be allowing recreational cannabis sales to the retail outlet,"" said Vancouver city councilor Geoff Meggs.

""We have a number of concerns about the location and the age of the employees and the age of the individuals who will be working in the retail outlet.""

The West End is a predominantly low-income neighbourhood. The dispensary is located on a busy street where there are 90 people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.

""I think that residents of the West End should be able to have a say in the direction that their neighbourhood is going,"" said Meggs.

The city is not the only one who is concerned about the location of the dispensary. The federal government has also made it clear that it is not interested in legalizing marijuana.

""In our view, it is not in the public interest to legalize a substance that is illegal under federal law,"" said a spokesperson for Ottawa. ""We expect the federal government to respond to this proposal in a way that appropriately balances public health and safety.""

Meggs says Vancouver will be watching closely.

"Gorgeous & beautiful

I received two packages this week and one of them is a beautiful turquoise blue dress with tulle and long straps. It fits nicely and feels very light. There are also two gorgeous earrings - one with a blue stone and one with a teal stone. I love them!

The other two packages contain two small bottles of something, either perfume or hair product, not quite sure.

The gifts didn't stay put, that's for sure. I was able to open them from behind, and they fell out as soon as I tried to put them back in. Both are beautiful and I appreciate this.

I received two cards and one note, thanking me for the gift, and also saying they are trying to make something for me next year. I also received a note that mentioned ""You may be wondering why I did not just send you your own money."" No reason why, just because they are a small business and they want to be polite to all of their people.

Thank you so much Santa!! You did a very good job!"
"Lets just begin, with an image of the game on a PC. It looks rather good, but if I try and do a comparison with a proper console, I can't imagine that it would look quite as good on another console.

The issue is, the graphics aren't actually that good for the game. They are a bit muddy, they lack detail, and the characters are all over the place. Not only is the game not as good as it could be, it's not nearly as good as the PC version.

You will notice that some of the other elements of the game are better. There are actually some great sound effects (although not at the same level as the PC game), and the backgrounds are much better. The game just doesn't look as good as a console game, and the framerate is pretty bad when playing in full screen modes (you want to play the game with the resolution you want at a reasonable framerate).

I'll do this for the PC version as well.

You'll notice that a lot of this is down to the game being a port. They need to make some improvements to the console ports to make them look decent, and the PC version doesn't do that.

One of the other issues, is the UI. The game doesn't really have a menu, you go into the options menu and that's it. You need to change resolution, change controls, and other things there. But when you go to start, there is nothing there. There is a loading screen to go to, a menu to go to, but the game doesn't even do anything after that. There is no way to play the game, you could put it on pause, it would still just be a loading screen.

It's almost as if the developers can't be bothered to make a decent UI for the game. All those options were in the PC/PS2 ports of the game, and yet, none of them actually worked to any benefit.

What makes something a port, you might be asking? Well, they can't have the game working, as they just want to make money off of it, don't they? And, as the price of a console system falls, publishers want to sell as many copies as they can as quickly as they can, so that they can get their money back. Because of this, they are forced to use ports.

There are only so many versions of every game, and consoles have been used to push out as many ports as they can for as cheap as they can get away with; which means that it would be a nightmare to port a game like this. It would be like trying to port Mario Kart when there are so many different versions of just that game on PC.

You're playing the PC version of this game, right?

You see, not only that, but this game was originally a PS"

"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The LDS Church has proposed a $35.7 billion plan to upgrade its aging infrastructure, including new housing and the construction of a new temple.

The church says it's part of an effort to save the church from financial ruin. The LDS Church's operating expenses could more than triple by 2030 under current proposals, compared to current projections.

The New York Times says the proposed plan is a rare glimpse into the LDS Church's financial planning.

The church plans on using the estimated $4 billion in cash reserves for debt service and spending money on projects. Most of the money would be used for construction of a new temple — with at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion going to projects around the world that will bring people into the church, such as the construction of temples in Mexico and Central America.

The Times says the plan does not include all the new housing. But it does include $12 billion in improvements to existing church housing.

The Times reports that the church has been meeting with federal loan guarantees to help with new construction. It says it's also working with investors and financial institutions to help raise money to purchase and manage real estate properties around the world that could be repurposed for the church.

It said the new facility would help reduce the church's dependence on land and property around the globe, as well as provide an expanded opportunity to expand the reach of the church.

"""The war against the Islamic State is a war against Islam itself,"" said Dr. Yusuf Badat, a spokesman for the U.S.-backed Syrian rebel group Harakat Hazzm. ""The only way to defeat this enemy is to defeat Islam, and that is the only way to defeat them.""

The Islamic State, often referred to as ISIS or ISIL, is a radical Sunni militant group that has seized large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria, and has been accused of atrocities such as the crucifixion of captured Syrian soldiers.

The U.S.-led coalition against the group has been conducting airstrikes against the group since 2014. Most of the strikes have been in Syria, but the U.S. has carried out small-scale strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq as well.

[A look at ISIS's propaganda machine]

The attacks have been so effective that the groups have been gaining strength. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the number of fighters in the Islamic State has dropped by about 70 percent since the beginning of the campaign, from 20,000 to 6,000.

The United States has carried out more than 1,000 airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since the end of 2014. The group has used drones to attack targets in Syria.

As the battle against the Islamic State rages in Syria and Iraq, the group has been making a number of other changes, including the hiring of foreign fighters and an emphasis on propaganda.

In the video, the Islamic State's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, warns that the group's fighters will soon be confronted by a ""bigger army."" He calls for recruits to fight in Syria and Iraq, and encourages them to carry out attacks in the West.

The Islamic State's foreign fighters are not a new development, said Michael Weiss, an expert on jihadist groups at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

""They have been recruiting foreign fighters since the group's inception,"" he said. ""But this is the first time they have sent them to fight in Syria and Iraq, and they have been able to get them to do so in a large enough number to have a significant impact on the battlefield.""

[The Islamic State has its own version of Snapchat]

In the video, al-Baghdadi promises that the Islamic State will conquer the ""lands of unbelief"" — a reference to areas of the Middle East. The group has captured large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. But it has also been losing ground.

After the Islamic State's defeat in Tikrit, Iraq, last month, a new leader in the group, Abu Omar al-Shishani, announced the creation of a new division in Syria. He called it the ""Jund al-Khilafa,"" or ""Soldiers of the Caliphate.""

"HAYWARD — A man was shot in the arm Sunday morning at a group home for juvenile offenders in the Berkeley neighborhood, police said.

The shooting occurred about 11:20 a.m. at the home, at 830 S. Gayley Ave., police reports said.

The shooting victim was taken to a hospital, where he is listed in stable condition.

Police did not have any information on a suspect."
"The Islamic State takes aim at government forces in Falluja, Iraq, through a sniper fire attack. The Sunni extremists have been blamed for a large number of suicide bombings in the country, including one on Iraq's parliament. (Reuters)

In its bid to rebuild the caliphate, the Islamic State is now focused on Iraq, where the country's security forces, with U.S. support, are now fighting to drive the militants from a key northern city and retake the second-largest city, Mosul.

The Islamic State has been involved in a series of suicide bombings in Baghdad and elsewhere that have killed dozens of people. In the past few days, the group has struck targets in Mosul, using a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, or VBIED, to attack security forces during a military operation.

The trucks were parked near a mosque in the city of Fallujah, about 30 miles north of Baghdad. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.

""We have reported this on social media several times and no one has taken action,"" said Ali al-Adeeb, a Fallujah resident. ""You can't fight terrorism with terrorism.""

The Islamic State is trying to create a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and its militants are conducting attacks on the West. The group is also waging an insurgency against the Syrian regime in the area.

In Iraq, the Islamic State has made a number of unsuccessful attempts to attack the Iraqi government and the Kurdish peshmerga forces. The group has also tried to seize cities in Syria, including Raqqa and Deir Ezzor. Experts say that if it is successful in Iraq, it will threaten not only the Iraqi government, but also the entire region.

""[The Islamic State] is trying to gain momentum by attacking the Iraqi army, which is a weak force,"" said Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. ""But we have been very clear that we are going to degrade and ultimately destroy [the Islamic State] and we are going to defeat them.""

The group has been trying to establish a foothold in the country since it first appeared in Syria in 2013, and it has made significant gains, including taking over the city of Fallujah and capturing the Iraqi city of Ramadi.

But it has suffered setbacks in recent months. The Iraqi forces announced in November that they had retaken the eastern city of Hit, while Iraqi, Kurdish and Syrian fighters are now fighting to retake Raqqa. The Iraqi government has also recently agreed to send more troops into Fallujah.

""In the end, the military operation will take a long time,"" said Jonathan Schanzer, a terrorism analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Many of the Islamic State's units, including much of [the unit responsible for] Fallujah, are still loyal to [the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr] al-"

"The origins of the fictional Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin are equally mysterious. In the end, the author's genius lies in how he manages to craft a series that is simultaneously an epic fantasy epic and a complex and interesting historical novel.

I recently finished reading George R.R. Martin's A Dance with Dragons. It's a massive book, and I'm sure many of us are going to have to wait until the seventh book, A Storm of Swords, for the full story. But the sheer amount of information that's contained in the first three books is very interesting, and in this post, I'm going to focus on some of the most interesting things that I learned about the series.

The History of Westeros

One of the first things I learned about the history of Westeros, the continent of Essos, and the Seven Kingdoms of the known world is that they all began with the birth of Rhaegar Targaryen. The birth of Rhaegar Targaryen is important because it establishes the ancient history of Westeros, but there is a twist.

The Targaryens are only one of several families that have been given the name Targaryen. In fact, the Targaryens are one of the oldest houses in the history of Westeros. But what is interesting about the Targaryens is how they have been able to continue to control the Seven Kingdoms for over 500 years.

The Targaryens came to Westeros from the continent of Essos. They are the most powerful of the Dothraki tribes living on the continent, and they are also the most educated. One of the ways in which the Targaryens have maintained control over the seven kingdoms is through their influence over the Valyrian steel industry.

This industry is the backbone of Westeros. The Valyrian steel industry was the second largest industry in the known world after the Valyrian steel mines of the Free Cities. The Valyrian steel industry was based on the idea of forging swords and armors from the very best metals, including Valyrian steel. The Valyrian steel industry produced the very best armors and swords known to man, and over the course of the Conquest, the Valyrian steel industry was able to flourish.

The Valyrian steel industry also created a new class of slaves and oppressed people in Westeros. The Valyrian steel industry was one of the most efficient and productive industries in the known world, but due to the brutal conditions of the Valyrian steel mines, the industry had long since ceased to be profitable.

The Valyrian steel industry was eventually abandoned, and the Valyrians left Westeros. But the Valyrians left behind a legacy, and one that continues to influence the people of Westeros today. The Valyrian steel industry, and the institutions that followed it, would"
"If you can't be with the one you love, try being with the two of them.

""A man will drown his own boat. He will live on the coast. He will find a woman — he will find a wife,"" wrote the great novelist and poet, Ernest Hemingway. But the poet never suggested that a woman try being with two men at once, nor did he seem to suggest that the couple might get a divorce. If anything, the two men may be in on a secret marriage.

Marriage rates in the United States have been declining for a couple generations, but that hasn't stopped ""the marriage of the future."" According to a new study from Stanford and Rutgers Universities, between 2010 and 2015, between 18 percent and 29 percent of American adults will have married someone they have known for less than a year, and between 22 and 27 percent — about 40 percent of all couples — will have married someone they've known for five years or longer.

So how did the country change over such a short period? Well, a recent study found that when men and women see a future spouse, it's often the same person.

So if we want to see more of our children married and in happy married lives, how can we encourage couples to be more realistic about their expectations — and not get stuck on the illusion that they are in love with their partners right from the beginning?"

An independent film about the assassination of John F. Kennedy has won the Audience Choice Award at the Venice International Film Festival.

An Independent Film has won the Audience Choice Award at the Venice International Film Festival

The documentary told the 'inside' story of a 'hidden chapter' in a story told about a 'conspiracy theory'.

Directed by Chris Marker (whose previous films include The Pianist, The Big Wedding and The Storyteller), an adaptation by Oscar-nominee Robert Kenner from the book by Philip Shenon, the film told of the assassination as it is 'considered by many to be the most important unsolved crime in American history'.

Marker said he wanted to tell the full story of the assassination as'many people have had their ideas about what happened' and that, 'I don't think we should dismiss conspiracy theories just because this was a mystery that was solved.'

The Audience Choice Award was presented to the film on Thursday night at a ceremony which also honored film-maker Michael Moore with the National Geographic's 'World's Most Influential' Award.

Watch a trailer for A Independent Film:

Awards editor Matthew Doran said: 'The film's powerful and well-crafted analysis of the conspiracy theories surrounding the killing, the power of the public's fascination with the story and the difficulty in establishing evidence and veracity has resonated so strongly.

'The Audience Choice Award goes to an independent film on a story that is still debated but that will be of interest for decades to come.'

Marker won an Oscar for his documentary The Piano in 1997.

The Film Society of Lincoln Center said it was also 'awesome' to see Marker and other Venice filmmakers receive the Audience Choice Award – it is the first time a film has won the top award since 2001.

"""A good night's sleep makes an army a mighty one"" - George Orwell.

I am a student first and a photographer second. I am passionate about shooting and have a passion for improving my process and skills. I love to shoot in a variety of lighting situations. I try to do as much as possible outside when there is still light. I'm always experimenting with light and composition. I am always on the lookout for new and interesting lighting situations and lenses.

If you are shooting with a fast APS-C camera, please read the Fotograf article on using Aperture priority mode for shooting on an APS-C with auto focus. I have also created a similar image without using any aperture to show what other aperture speeds can do on APS-C.

As a beginner I prefer using manual flash rather than a high power speedlight when I shoot landscape in night conditions; however, at the same time, I know not all light sources are created equal when shooting on night time, or day light as it is for most of us. I like to be able to control the levels of light coming from all sources that may be present, rather than having to guess which sources will be most optimal. I also like to control camera noise more than I am used to, so usually I'm shooting at ISO 400 or 800 with a flash or strobe with a shutter speed of 1/125 or 1/30th, so the camera only uses about half the time to expose the entire image.

I have a Canon 1DX and a Canon 5D III, so I shoot a variety of ISO levels to keep things interesting and challenging. As I develop my technique, I'll add ISO values to this list, but this is a very simplified and general overview. Below is a chart listing my current favorites. I do not take into account the benefits of using a faster lens."

"A few weeks ago, the ""War on Men"" and its various incarnations were the stuff of academic research, the subject of popular fiction and of political cartoons on the evening news. This week, President Obama's ""war"" is being felt far more widely.

Over the course of his recent State of the Union address—his fourth—the president made some of the more important points he can think of about the decline of marriage and family as we know them. And they were a lot of things. He called on Congress to change immigration policies so that more immigrant women get ""access to birth control at their local Planned Parenthood."" He said the government should make it easier for working mothers to stay on their schedules. He criticized an ad campaign in which a father was told his son should not have to pay for the costs of his higher education. On this last point, he told the story of a daughter who was too often forced ""to pay thousands of dollars for her education that could have been covered by Social Security.""

Obama also spoke of the need to address gender-based economic inequality—a clear effort to use the public platform for a broad progressive agenda that includes things such as equal pay, paid sick days, and childcare for working parents.

""That is the kind of change we need to see in America, so that no hardworking person has to make a choice between keeping a job or being able to afford childcare or going back to school. So that parents can get the day off if they need it,"" Obama said.

That's the message of the day. But it's only part of the story. While the president's speech was all about policy—what he would have done if he were president—women and girls saw little of it. In fact, all the talk from both men and women—and men and women and men—about the need to address men's ""differences"" in order to create a more just world for women, and thus the need to end the wage gap, ignores what is happening to boys and young men of color.

""My dad was a coal miner,"" said Jami, a 22-year-old from West Virginia. ""My dad was a coal miner. I am the last female coal miner."" Jami is speaking in the wake of the historic coal strike of 1984 that was a turning point for women's rights and environmentalism in the United States: the miners, joined by thousands of women from organizations around the country, brought an end to the ""War on Coal,"" and won a new era of labor protections and wage parity at low-paying jobs in the industry. ""It seems like only recently have I been able to have these conversations with women in my life,"" said Jami, ""but I'm still new on this conversation on my own.""

For generations, women in the United States have been doing the bulk of the work that men are expected to do."

Well, we all know that a lot of the time, Republicans and conservatives are not exactly the kind of liberal or progressive that we would expect. They're just people. But apparently, their beliefs are not a big deal when they're not in government jobs.

From Raw Story:

[T]he conservative group Club for Growth recently released an ad targeting Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) that showed Portman eating a doughnut with a doughnut hole in it. This is a pretty strange image for Portman to eat because it looks something like a donut with a hole in it. But to the conservative group that made this ad, it's completely innocuous and therefore completely forgivable.

That's right. Conservative organizations and individuals, the same groups who have been pushing for the creation of new federal ""regulations"" to censor and restrict access to abortion, are okay with using their government job titles on food. It has nothing to do with government jobs, but they find it less offensive:

[H]e is just eating a doughnut. He's at least a Republican. He is not a conservative activist. And what we know about him is that he is not a conservative who is promoting conservative ideals and policies. The fact that he would eat a doughnut with a hole in it is pretty mundane information. He's not talking about taxes. He's not talking about spending. He's just doing anything to take a break.

Well, it's also pretty mundane to him, but let's assume for a second that he is talking about taxes. It's also pretty mundane to conservatives who are arguing against government regulations because they think the regulations would make eating doughnuts with holes in them less safe and fun."

Klinsmann and Dortmund vice president, Hans-Joachim Watzke will discuss issues of cooperation and competition at the general assembly of the German club this weekend in Dortmund on Saturday before the match between Dortmund and FC Schalke on Sunday.

In a short video posted by Borussia Dortmund, Klinsmann talks about how Dortmund's cooperation with German coach Jurgen Klinsmann is a part of the club's ""project.""

""Borussia Dortmund is very happy for Jurgen Klinsmann. We are very proud for our association with Jurgen Klinsmann, that he came here to help the club develop,"" the statement reads. ""Our partnership with Jurgen Klinsmann is a part of the club's project. It is a project which is not only about winning a championship but about the development of the people that work for us. It is a project with a long term perspective.""

The meeting between the two national team coaches is expected to provide further visibility for Borussia Dortmund as they continue to grow in stature as a successful and established club, despite having failed to make the UEFA Europa League semifinals in 2010 through five seasons. The two will not discuss tactical matters or the upcoming match when there is a Champions League round-robin match on Saturday against Shaktar Donetsk in Istanbul."

"The real reason for the decline in coal jobs, and the price of natural gas, is that there simply aren't enough people to do them.

We shouldn't be surprised.

The United States is the world's largest fossil fuel consumer, and coal is the largest source of carbon dioxide and a major contributor to global warming. As a result, coal has had a long, rocky history in this country.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coal made up about 20 percent of the nation's electrical power. But by the 1970s, that share had fallen to less than 5 percent. By the 1990s, coal employment had fallen to about half of its level in the 1970s.

By 2007, coal accounted for less than half of U.S. electrical power generation.

The good news is that coal employment is growing today. It's currently up about about 8 percent in the past three years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But it still represents just about one out of every four electrical workers, and its share of the U.S. economy is still about one-fifth of what it was in 2003.

So why hasn't the U.S. coal industry recovered?

Part of the reason is that the economy has shifted away from coal, said Robert Howarth, an economics professor at George Mason University.

""The economy is not as dependent on coal as it was in the past,"" Howarth said. ""When you have a downturn in the economy, the demand for coal goes down. Coal companies don't make as many profits. Businesses are less willing to invest in coal.""

Another part of the reason the coal industry has been slow to recover is that coal is increasingly being replaced by cheaper, cleaner-burning natural gas.

In 2011, natural gas made up about 21 percent of U.S. electricity generation, up from about 16 percent in 2000. And natural gas has been replacing coal as the nation's primary source of electricity generation in some parts of the country.

""We've been moving away from coal in most of the country,"" Howarth said. ""I think we really have the numbers to show that.""

The reason for the surge in natural gas, however, isn't necessarily because of the rise in domestic natural gas production. Natural gas is a major part of the nation's energy mix, but it is also a relatively new source of electricity generation.

""We've had natural gas for a long time, but we've only really started making a dent in the use of natural gas,"" Howarth said. ""And that's partly because the U.S. has been a major exporter of natural gas.""

As a result, the amount of natural gas used in the United States has increased faster than the amount of electricity produced from that gas.

Howarth said that the combination"
"The following was posted on the Facebook page of the ""American Atheists.""

Today we learned some things...

1. Atheists are human beings who care about humanity.

2. Atheists are not hateful people. The way to get to know an atheist is to talk out loud with them, not to bash them.

3. Atheists are a part of the human family.

4. Atheism is not about faith, not about faith and science.

5. Atheists are not ""weird.""

6. Atheism is not about a lack of belief.

Now that's what we call a great conversation.

""If you're going to tell me that you don't believe in anything in particular, it seems like it would help if you could be more specific,"" said Jim Campbell, the atheist activist. ""If you say, 'Well, I don't believe in god because it makes no sense...' that's going to be a lot more helpful than if you talk about faith but you don't really offer up an argument either way.""


That's what I will do.

I didn't hear from Campbell, but I hope that he gets a lot of support from atheists across the country.

Atheism is so much more than a lack of belief, and it shows the world how much more our society needs to be inclusive of those who don't have faith. We need to show everyone that we, like those atheists we so dearly disagree with, care about humanity, and love those who are different from us.

"I know, I know, you're all asking yourself which of the ""Five Reasons"" I haven't said anything about this week on the blog and then, a few days later, I see ""How to Win at Life.""

Yes. In a nutshell, there are just six things. And each needs to be performed well for it to be counted as a ""win,"" i.e. a success.

1

""The first piece of advice I want you to get out of your system, if you don't already understand it, is that success is not a single event. Your success is determined by a series of small accomplishments, working as a team, over time. That's a big part of life. Make little things count — each month, every sale — and you'll get bigger things done.""

I have to confess that, when I first read this, I laughed out loud. I can't stand this sort of stuff. After all, when you tell someone to do ""little things,"" you mean, you want them to become ""satisfied"" with something, which is never a goal, but which is meant to make them feel better about the overall level of activity. We all know that when we find ourselves ""enjoying"" something, it's only because we've gotten to that point where we think it's fun, and thus somehow better than we thought it was before. (This is why we see friends spend so much time on Facebook — because even though they don't get to do very much, the fact that they're not doing anything actually makes them feel better than they did before. Which, in turn, increases the time they spend doing it.)

(And in any event, the idea that ""success is a single event"" is a gross simplification of a complex world where people do lots of things simultaneously, in the order they happen. Most people don't think in this sort of ""big picture"" way. You can't just set goals by saying, ""I want to be a happy person who helps my friends,"" because people aren't really that motivated by this, or, at least, not by this sort of specific, measurable goal. And then, if you don't meet that goal ….)

My question is this: why are we telling people that success is in the number of small events, when the truth is very different, and very counter-intuitive? Is there any kind of logical, rational reason why we need to tell people to ""get started"" on something, instead of saying, ""Make this idea a reality""? (I'll also add here that, again, my answer to this question is that, if we are truly interested in helping people to succeed, as our main goal, instead of just creating emotional rewards that will disappear soon, it's probably a good idea to actually tell people what to do.)

"The question is, how much does a piece of brand-name technology, like the iPhone, really cost?

The latest data from IHS iSuppli shows that the total cost of developing the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, including the components, is expected to be around $249.5 million. In comparison, Apple has spent $22.4 billion on research and development over the last five years.

""There's a shift in the industry from research and development to consumer products,"" says David McAtee, an analyst with IHS. ""That's why the cost of research and development is going down.""

IHS also estimates that the total total cost of making the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will be around $49 billion, with a high-end estimate of $50 billion.

IHS also estimates that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will sell for $705 and $727, respectively. That's higher than the company's previous estimates for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which predicted a base price of $649 and a higher-end price of $749.

IHS also projects that Apple's iPhone 5s will eventually sell for $150, leaving the company with a total of $50 billion in profit from its smartphone business.

The iPhone is the most profitable product in Apple's history. The company doesn't break out revenue from that segment, but estimates by IDC suggest that the iPhone accounted for about $8 billion of Apple's $55.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2013.

IHS estimates that Apple sold 60.2 million iPhones last quarter, down from 66 million in the previous quarter. However, the iPhone 5s was clearly a hit with consumers, with IHS projecting that the device sold 32 million units during the first three months of 2013.

Apple's iPad lineup is also expected to be a huge hit going forward. IHS says the iPad will sell 15.7 million units during the first quarter of this year, up from 14.1 million in the same quarter last year.

The iPad mini is expected to sell 14 million units during the first quarter, up from 13.9 million in the first quarter of 2012.

IHS also says that Apple's Mac hardware will continue to grow throughout the year, generating $11.5 billion in revenue."
"Mr. Obama has said that he thinks the issue of the Islamic State will be solved by the time of his second term.

The White House announced on Friday that Mr. Obama would travel to the Middle East on Tuesday for meetings in Egypt and Israel.

The Islamic State, an extremist group that controls large swaths of Iraq and Syria, has been driven out of towns and cities in Iraq after a month of fighting that has killed thousands of people, including many who have been evacuated from the region. But it has not been defeated.

So far, Mr. Obama has said, the United States has only limited capabilities to combat the militants. He said that the militants had been defeated in Iraq, but that it would take time to eliminate them in Syria.

Mr. Obama also said that he had instructed his administration to coordinate with Arab nations to expand the air campaign against the Islamic State.

He said that he also had asked for more resources to train forces in Iraq and Syria to combat the Islamic State and that he was seeking additional help from Congress to do so.

Mr. Obama acknowledged that the Islamic State had not been routed in Iraq. But he said that the militants' ability to carry out attacks had been weakened and that the United States could, by targeting their financing, counter some of their efforts to recruit new members.

""We're going to have to work with the Iraqis to make sure that we are very clear about what we're going to do to root out and destroy ISIL and make sure that we provide the kinds of support that will help them do that,"" he said."
"The ""Korean Wave"" has been one of the main trends of the past several years, as Korean celebrities have come to be more popular outside of South Korea due to their international appeal. These individuals represent one of the fastest growing industries today. Now that Korean culture is spreading to other countries, these acts have begun touring the world to promote their popularity, all to the tune of massive fees. However, some of these acts are charging ridiculously outrageous fees for their services. Some of these fees have run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars and some have been over $10 million.

1. BTS – The Bangtan Boys

In their first world tour, BTS has seen several big names from America and the UK come out to support them. This tour has brought an unprecedented amount of attention to the group. However, once on the road, many of these tours would go to the tune of hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars spent by these bands. These individuals, all very deserving of some exposure, have been seen to spend between 20,000 to 40,000 dollars on their ""fans"" (as they call them) to pay for ""travel fees"" for them to come. Many of these fans are young and relatively new to the music industry, so the price of these passes must be extremely high considering it takes so much more time and attention to get them signed and established. These artists are also able to book these tours with a lot more control.

2. BTS – Crush

On their second world tour, BTS played the concert Crush in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where the ticket price was set at a whopping $200 million (around $100 million AUD) to attend. To put the price of the tickets in perspective, that is the equivalent to around $15 million dollars in the United States. This means that, in their first world tour, BTS made $1 million dollars per show with the ticket price alone. At that price, this band is basically making twice what you would have made with the average ""real"" job in a city you could live in. How does one survive on that kind of income? In the United States, most people would be paying $20,000 USD a year for a house, and that would take at least five years of your life to pay it off. With the average ticket price of that same concert in the UK set at $80,000, it takes almost a decade of payments to pay it off.

3. Girls' Generation – The Girls' Generation

On their world tour this past February, Girls' Generation came out to play to the concert The Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. At that concert, they were able to give 200 fans the ability to have them perform with them on stage after the show. So, after 200 fans were given tickets, how did the girls manage to bring in 200 people that could purchase the tickets at the concert price"
"The highlight of this afternoon's first full-team practice of camp was seeing quarterback Matt Barkley take snaps from center for the first time. As you can see in the video below, Barkley, who had been working in the slot the entire offseason, was able to get the ball out quickly and be sure to make the right move.

As you'll see in the video, the first pass of this practice was a bomb to receiver Mario Alford, who was running a wide pattern and was able to make an athletic grab for the catch, but Barkley was able to make the throw on time and get Alford open.

That was just the start of the wide receiver movement, as rookie receiver Josh Huff caught a pass from Barkley right after Alford's touchdown. The next time the two players were on the field, Huff made a nice catch, and then Barkley threw a strike to tight end Zach Ertz, who was running a deep comeback route.

Barkley showed good confidence in Alford and Huff, and it helped that he had a new quarterback in his pocket, as the team worked on its first series of offense.

The first play of this series was a pass to veteran wide receiver Torrey Smith, and the ball was thrown pretty well. Barkley was able to get the ball out quickly, and it was tight coverage, which helped Smith make the catch.

The next play after that was a pass to rookie wide receiver Robert Woods, and it was practically textbook. The pass was thrown almost exactly on the so-called ""time out"" concept, and the ball was thrown perfectly in front of Woods. It was a great pass, as Woods (who had just returned from surgery) was able to get a good jump on the ball and make a diving grab for the catch."
"Casting a wider net for the best talent is always a good idea when it comes to building your roster. We've explored the best free agent signings at each position, but what about the best undrafted free agent signings?

The NFL Draft is over, but free agency is just starting. We're looking at the best undrafted free agents you can find, and the ones who made the most of their chances.

This list is not meant to be an all-inclusive list. There are some players who have been very successful and have gone on to have long careers in the league, and some who have failed miserably. I don't think it's a coincidence that the players on this list are generally good size for their position, and some of them even have a little bit of a ""WOW"" factor.

Anyway, here are my thoughts on the top undrafted free agents of the 2012 NFL Draft.

Danny Amendola, WR, New England Patriots

The Patriots have a history of signing undrafted free agents to their roster, and it looks like they'll be adding another one to the squad in Danny Amendola. Amendola was a four-year starter at Penn State, and resulted in a 36-473-1 stat line over those four years. He's also earned the nickname ""Amendola the Freak"" for his ability to stretch the field vertically as well as vertically.

Amendola is a skilled route runner, and when you combine that with his size and speed you have a very intriguing prospect in the making. I think it's fair to say that he has the potential to be a dynamic player in the league, although he has some issues working in tight window coverage and not being able to get leverage. If he can continue to improve his fundamentals, however, he could be a very good player in the league.

Antonio Gates, TE, San Diego Chargers

Gates was one of the bigger names on the free agent market, and came highly regarded by a few teams. He had never been drafted before the 2012 NFL Draft, but he has a lot of talent. The problem is that Gates's career has fallen off a cliff since 2004, when he was one of the best tight ends in the NFL. He has struck out on a few good teams over the years, but he's still very much in the prime of his career.

Gates is a great athlete, and he can make people miss in tight windows, but he's also a bit of a tweener at tight end. This year he could be a little bit of a project, with the Chargers trying to play him out of the slot. A lot of teams are intrigued by Gates, but I don't expect him to sign with a team in the near future.

Luke Kuechly, LB, Carolina Panthers

"On Friday, President Barack Obama finally announced the final details of his landmark executive order designed to protect millions of undocumented immigrants currently residing in America, calling it ""the most comprehensive change to our immigration system in nearly 50 years.""

This is a far cry from the plan he presented on January 15, which was meant to be an immediate, comprehensive solution that could be implemented quickly without Congress. But the announcement was welcomed with open arms by the left, with even Hillary Clinton praising the move.

Despite his claims to be the ""champion"" of American workers, President Obama's executive order was a massive failure. He managed, with a stroke of the pen, to kill both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, and gut the Clean Power Plan, yet left millions of undocumented migrants living in the nation's interior still in limbo.

For Democrats, the announcement was a major triumph. Indeed, it's widely believed that the announcement is one of Obama's last important political accomplishments and a crucial step he will take this year to protect his legacy from a GOP-led Congress. ""I think his legacy will be his executive actions,"" Obama said in a press conference Friday morning.

Yet to many other Americans, the announcement was a total tragedy. Here are a few facts about the announcement that don't get mentioned.

1. Only one million will be allowed into the U.S. under Obama's executive order.

Despite the hype from the progressive left, the Obama administration only plans on allowing in approximately one million undocumented immigrants.

""The United States immigration system remains broken,"" the president wrote. ""Our legal immigration system prioritizes family reunification over skill-based immigration. In the United States, people of all nationalities contribute and thrive here. But there are now more than three million undocumented immigrants in the country, and many have lived here for years and have children who are American citizens or have family members here. For almost two decades, there has been nothing on Capitol Hill to fix the broken immigration system.""

2. The Obama plan leaves untold tens of millions of undocumented immigrants in limbo.

In effect, the president is creating a parallel government, while ignoring the fact that he's unilaterally creating a parallel parallel government.

""I have ordered that at least two years of the border crisis be resolved and that the government develop an additional system whereby the parents of minors who are coming here illegally are not identified, and if we ever can do a better job of protecting border security,"" President Obama explained. ""It remains my view that we do not need a law passed that will make it easier for companies to outsource their jobs to places where their workers are forced to live in fear of exploitation.""

And, that's exactly what the plan does. The administration does not mention any other areas of concern related to undocumented workers or their rights, but they do include the ""fear of exploitation"" as a condition"
"BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Ravens have released defensive lineman Arthur Jones, the team announced Saturday.

Jones, 32, was signed to a two-year, $2.9 million deal this offseason. However, he played in just two games because of a groin injury.

The Ravens' defensive line was an area of need this season, as the unit surrendered the most sacks in the NFL (63).

Jones worked as a defensive lineman in college at Miami, but was a guard at the time of his release.

Jones had a career-high 10 sacks last season."

"When the Supreme Court last week struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), it was a monumental moment for the gay rights movement. Homosexual couples in states that recognized their marriages were finally permitted to cite it in their divorce cases, and their marriages were no longer penalized when they moved to a state that didn't.

But the Supreme Court's decision to throw out DOMA, which had been in effect since 1996, wasn't without controversy. Among other things, the court's ruling found that DOMA's definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The constitutionality of DOMA in itself is a complicated question. In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that the federal Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional. But the court's decision didn't hold that marriage is a fundamental right that the federal government must recognize or grant to all Americans equally. It only required that states recognize same-sex marriages.

That means that DOMA's supporters had to argue that the federal government, which they argued was bound by the Constitution, should recognize same-sex marriages.

But on Wednesday, the Supreme Court declined to do that, telling the lower courts to stop enforcing DOMA and allowing same-sex couples across the country to marry.

But the Court's move came with some troubling implications. As a result of the decision to throw out DOMA, same-sex couples who married in the states where the ban was still in effect will now find themselves legally barred from getting married in their new state.

The Supreme Court's decision to throw out DOMA came in a case involving Edith Windsor, a 71-year-old New York widow who had been a resident of New York but had lived in Canada since 1976. Windsor had married her soon-to-be-ex-wife, Thea Spyer, in Canada in 2007. The two moved back to New York in 2009 to live with Thea's parents, but when Spyer died unexpectedly in 2010, Windsor became worried about paying the taxes on her New York estate.

Windsor and Spyer had been in a premarital relationship for about 17 years when they married in Canada, and the couple had a son, Charlie.

Windsor sued for spousal support, arguing that because her marriage to Spyer was not recognized in New York, she had no right to the $363,053 she was owed. Spyer's parents, New York residents, had filed a suit for spousal support against Windsor, arguing that their son's death had created a marital asset that Windsor should be compensated for.

Windsor was granted a temporary restraining order blocking the New York court's ruling from going into effect. But while the federal government had recognized Windsor's marriage in Canada, it didn't recognize her marriage to Spyer in New York"

"The Hoboken City Council has issued a new resolution calling on the state legislature to pass the ""Hoboken Vision 2020"", a plan to create ""a sustainable, livable city and a vibrant place to live, work and play, offering a future that is less dependent on fossil fuels"" by 2030. The resolution states, ""Hoboken will be a leader in the creation and implementation of a sustainable, livable city and a vibrant place to live, work and play, offering a future that is less dependent on fossil fuels.""

The motion was passed on the same day as a hearing on the plan at the council chambers, at which a number of speakers spoke in opposition. The proposed plan is the result of a year of study, and the plan is being touted as a way to reduce emissions, encourage sustainable development and provide the city with a quality of life that is as good as or better than that in more expensive areas of the country.

The resolution is being promoted by the Hoboken Economic Development Corporation (HEDC), an agency of the City of Hoboken that seeks to increase economic development in the city. The city commissioned the study and has been evaluating its recommendations since February 2014.

"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China will provide $1 billion in assistance to Hong Kong over the next three years, a government spokesman said on Thursday, as concerns mount over its rising political tension.

Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying arrives for the annual National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing, China, March 4, 2016. REUTERS/Fred Yao

Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997, but it remains subject to the laws, culture and policies of a ""one country, two systems"" model of government. That has led to occasional violent clashes and a fierce debate about Hong Kong's role in the China era.

China says Hong Kong's freedoms are protected in its ""one country, two systems"" system, adding that it would continue to help the former British colony deal with the aftermath of a pro-democracy protests.

However, the territory has been hit by several outbreaks of tension in recent months. One of the most serious came when hundreds of students marched through the streets of Tai Po in late September.

Tensions escalated when protesters blocked traffic for three days to demand that Beijing withdraw its pledge to allow the legislature to elect its leader, an issue the central government denies it has the power to unilaterally change.

The government will spend about $700 million over the next three years to help provide social welfare for the city and other Hong Kong people. The money will come from the central government's budget, spokesman Lu Wei said.

""Our basic purpose is to provide Hong Kong people with welfare services and other social security benefits and support Hong Kong people in their activities of democratic self-determination and self-rule in accordance with the Basic Law and other relevant laws,"" Lu said, quoting an order by the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress.

Lu's statement did not mention whether Beijing would use its budget to support those in Hong Kong who are against Beijing, but critics said that risked a confrontation.

""You cannot have social services and social security on a limited budget, especially in a very tense situation,"" said Joseph Fewer, a former foreign affairs officer for the city and China expert at Temple University in Hong Kong.

""It (the government) can only spend 50 percent of its budget on social services and social security. That's not a huge amount of money to spend on so many people's welfare.""

China's government said in November that it would grant universal suffrage to Hong Kong's 2017 election, but the Basic Law stipulates that its first election can only take place after 2017.

Tai-Kauk Lu, former political editor at the Chinese edition of the Hong Kong newspaper Modern Express, said he thought the central government was ""very likely"" to make Hong Kong a special economic zone, which would restrict freedoms and allow it closer ties to Beijing and help it better integrate with China.

Quick Walkthrough [ edit ]

Speak with Derna at the Red Rock Bluff Inn. Head to Ebonheart and follow the Red Mountain Summit Road east. Travel to Ebonheart, the city of the Redguards. Defeat the Bal-Kathos and speak to Derna at the Red Rock Bluff Inn.

Detailed Walkthrough [ edit ]

Derna at the Red Rock Bluff Inn [ edit ]

Derna runs the Red Rock Bluff Inn in Red Rock Bluff. He will ask you to speak with him about a quest and then to kill the Bal-Kathos at the Red Mountain Summit, located just to the east of Red Rock Bluff. To start the quest, return from Gnaar Mok to the Red Rock Bluff Inn, where two Bal-Kathos are standing by the entrance (both Bal-Kathos can only be killed by the same method as described below). As they are already dead, there is no additional dialogue. You can speak with Derna the next time you arrive in Red Rock Bluff.

Note: If you are trying to get more than one sidequest during this quest, you will miss the next quest if you are using the Fast Travel system with a different faction (which will also cause you to miss the quest ""Bugs in the Ice""). The only way you can get rid of more than one sidequest at the same time is by using this cheat code:

Travel back to the original point of departure. Wait 2 days.

Reward [ edit ]

Note: You are only rewarded when speaking to Derna about completing the quest.[verification needed — see ] If you completed the sidequests, you can gain three items from Derna: One of these items will appear in your inventory once you complete the quest; all three of these items are randomly dropped randomly once you complete the quest. You also return to Derna and receive one of his key items, which will appear in the container you were in when you talked to him. You can also find them on Derna's person: He has a few in his house in Red Rock Bluff, and there are others scattered around Red Rock Bluff. You must be able to see the items before you can pick them up.

"The White House on Thursday issued a statement on its decision to leave the Paris climate accord, saying the U.S. will still work to preserve clean air and water as well as avoid greenhouse gas emissions that are linked to climate change.

""The United States is withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement,"" the statement said.

ADVERTISEMENT

President Trump announced last month that the U.S. would pull out of the agreement, which commits 195 countries to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. It was an abrupt reversal from the White House, which had advocated for the agreement.

There are exceptions to the U.S. commitment to the climate pact, including those that are based on voluntary commitments from individual countries. The United States has not ratified those treaties.

The White House said the accord would be ""irreversible"" and that the U.S. will support those countries that are working to reduce the impacts of climate change.

""The Paris agreement is a bad deal for the United States,"" the statement said. ""It is very unfair to the United States, and the millions of Americans who work hard every day to create jobs, raise wages, and protect our planet.""

""The last thing our country should be doing is entering into an agreement that imposes unfair burdens on the United States, or the world, that don't put America first.""

The White House said the U.S. will ""continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth"" while pursuing an ""all of the above"" energy strategy.

The administration said Trump will work with Congress to rewrite the clean power plan, which aims to cut carbon pollution from power plants.

""The administration will also work with Congress to deliver on the President's promise to bring back millions of decent-paying American jobs by ensuring American energy companies have the energy and capital to export overseas,"" the statement said.

""The American people elected a president who is committed to creating jobs through pro-growth policies that lower taxes, cut regulation, and promote exports that create jobs. That's what will be done with respect to the Paris agreement.""

'CANCELED'

The Trump administration's decision to exit the agreement has been met with disapproval by the world's top scientific bodies, including the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The group said the withdrawal ""cannot be reconciled with the U.S. commitment to the goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement.""

The U.N. panel on Thursday urged the U.S. to reconsider its decision to exit the climate pact, arguing that ""the political will"" to fight climate change was already in place.

The United States is one of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters, primarily because of coal-fired power plants.

It wasn't exactly a surprise on December 17, 1992, when John Cena defeated Bret Hart at WrestleMania III. But it was still a surprise, nonetheless.

As the two competitors locked in the first-ever Intercontinental Championship Match, the reaction of The Dungeon of Doom was electric. The night prior, the ""Hart Foundation"" had defeated The ""Hit Man"" in a classic that seemed to have everyone on top of their game. No one, however, was as fired up as the crew of The Outsiders, led by Diesel.

""I was up there, and it was a long, bitter, bitter, bitter experience for me,"" WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes recalled in the wake of the bout. ""The guys who did the 'Hit Man' gimmick, they worked so hard that night, and they were not in the moment. I just figured it was a matter of time before somebody beat Bret Hart.""

With The Outsiders leading the charge against Hart, it wasn't uncommon to see one of their members, The Road Dogg, get tossed on some sort of makeshift table. But the intensity seemed to reach a new level when Diesel emerged from his corner and went for The Hitman's neck. Diesel's attack was brutal.

Bret Hart was thrown from the ring. WWE

As Hart tumbled to the floor, his head buried in the dirt, he looked up at the crowd and saw what many were stunned to see. The Dead Man—who spent most of the match trying to keep control of the contest—was now in the midst of an assault and chokehold, which was causing him tremendous pain. And the referee, after several minutes of trying to help the troubled ""Hit Man,"" was actually stepping in the ring to help out the WWE World Heavyweight Champion.

The referee, after several minutes of trying to help the troubled ""Hit Man,"" was actually stepping in the ring to help out the WWE World Heavyweight Champion

""Bret Hart is up on the apron, and there's a gentleman who is actually helping John Cena,"" Paul Heyman later recalled. ""The gentleman doesn't want to be helping, but it had become one heck of a show.""

WWE officials took action at that moment. The referee was brought in to break the hold and wrestle The Outsiders, while Hart was helped backstage. Even though the match would carry on, it would remain one of the greatest moments in WWE history as the referee helped to revive ""The Hitman.""

""It was all right when they started wrestling each other, to be honest with you,"" former WWE World Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage told WWE Network. ""I'm sitting in a chair down there, and I look around and I see [Diesel and The Outsiders] having the whole time, [the referee] keeping these guys in bounds. The fans were cheering. These guys were standing up"
"""My name is Alex. I'm just some guy.""

Alex was wearing a gray T-shirt and jeans. The white line-through letters that were stamped across his forehead, one side at a time, read ""RACISM.""

Racism. It was a new thing for him. A word, an accusation. A thought, something that had been inside of his guts for as long as he could remember. But he felt like he had finally found it, and the idea it had taken over his head felt like a weight had been lifted.

""No way! Why would you even say that?"" Alex shook his head. ""I'm not racist! Why would anyone be racist?""

Alex looked up to catch a glimpse of the person who had spoken to him earlier. He could tell she was a different person from the one he'd seen in front of the bus. He could tell she wasn't the same person.

But why?

""How would you know?""

Alex's voice was high and his breathing was rapid. ""I'm gonna find out!""

He was heading out of the city. From the way people spoke, he suspected the city was somewhere else. He didn't know how many places he would be traveling to, but if he stopped here for a while, he thought they would come from the United States or Europe.

He was moving because he had something to do. Something that felt important.

As he made his way down the street, an unfamiliar woman in a different-blue shirt approached him. She called out his name.

""Alex. How is it that one person could cause so much trouble for you?""

With those words, Alex was struck by how different she looked, both physically and mentally. The woman was the same woman, with the same height and weight, but the way she acted was completely different. The young woman, with black hair to her shoulders and an olive complexion, had a calm demeanor. Yet the woman he'd last seen looked almost angry.

Alex looked to his left, but he didn't see the woman. He looked back up at the woman, who nodded and pointed.

He turned around and continued walking down the street. He was not scared of what he might see. He was scared of what he might get.

And so Alex, an American, would never forget his first day in Germany."
"The two-year ACLU study found that ""police officers use force against African-Americans at rates far greater than Whites, especially when they use lethal force.""

This isn't the first time that the ACLU has found that blacks are more likely to be treated unfairly by the police. In a 2010 report, they found that blacks were more likely than whites to be arrested for nonviolent offenses, and that when they were, they were much more likely to be prosecuted.

The ACLU also found that blacks were much more likely to be stopped and frisked by police.

The report, ""Unjustified: How Racial Profiling Threatens Our Privacy, Threatens Our Communities, and Threatens Our Lives,"" is available online.

It says that ""the overwhelming majority of police stops initiated by police in the United States are for minor offenses, such as jaywalking, disorderly conduct, or failure to obey a police officer's direction. But then, after these minor violations, the people stopped are much more likely to be black and Latino, and they are much more likely to be searched, to be arrested, to have their property confiscated, to be subjected to forced cavity searches and other invasive searches, to be placed under arrest, and to receive harsher punishment.""

The report says that these patterns are driven by racial profiling.

""Research shows that people of color are more likely than whites to be stopped and searched, charged with crimes, and convicted of crimes. This racial disparity in the criminal justice system is a direct result of the racial profiling that has become so common in our society,"" the report says.

There is no precise definition of racial profiling, but the ACLU says it is a ""systematic practice of law enforcement that employs racial or ethnic profiling in law enforcement decision making.""

The ACLU is asking Congress to set up a special committee to study racial profiling and hold hearings on the issue.

""It is vital that we have a Congressional investigation to understand what is happening in our country, and why it is happening and to hold accountable those who are engaged in this egregious and unjustified practice,"" said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. ""The American people deserve nothing less.""

"The following is excerpted from The New York Times Bestseller, The Science of Sleep: A Life in Neurobiology, which was co-written by Dr. Steven Novella. The book offers an inside look on scientific research, making it a fun and engaging read.

The most famous experiment on sleep by a sleep scientist was conducted back in the 1940s in a laboratory at Stanford University by the American pediatrician and researcher William B. Fitch. The experiment was designed to discover whether the brain could actually distinguish its own internal clocks from those of other mammals.

One hour after bedtime, Fitch placed a cat in a cage with two glass bowls. One contained a piece of fruit juice that Fitch had given to the cat. The other bowl lacked fruit juice but contained a chemical substance that Fitch had made a week earlier by heating and mixing pure sodium fluoride with a mixture of sodium chloride and carbon dioxide. [You can learn more about this experiment on sleep, and the history of Fitch's research, in a BBC.com video, Sleeping Through the Night: Dr. William B. Fitch's Experiment at Stanford University.]

The researchers watched how the feline slept. If the cat had fallen asleep in the open air without some form of protection, the bowl containing the pure fructose was going to make it lose some of its sodium and sodium chloride reserves, and therefore will start to wake up in the night. The same thing happened when the cat was placed in a cage with a straw. But, if the cat had previously been sleeping in a cage with a straw in it, the brain of the cat in the empty bowl would be forced to use the pure fructose, and will wake up only after the sugar had become unavailable, because it had run out of sodium.

As Fitch had predicted, the cat was able to distinguish between bowls containing their own juice, versus those from pure fructose. The only significant difference was that the cat didn't feel hungry when drinking the fruit juice bowl. The more feline-like the cat appears, the more it will perceive being sleepy.

For decades afterward, most sleep scientists continued to believe that cats were incapable of distinguishing between different time intervals of sleep because this experiment demonstrated that the brain couldn't do that. If we could somehow simulate sleep in animals, the argument went, the brain would inevitably experience an overabundance of information that would make it perceive sleep as having occurred more than once.

It's important, though, to understand how the experiment was designed — and how it actually did the brain no favors.

Fitch designed the experiment with a special purpose in mind. Sleep, he knew, is a critical stage of the animal's life cycle, and when the cat falls asleep its brain is still active. But, once it goes into a hibernation-like state that mimics death, its brain is no longer under the influence of the chemical chemicals"

"RUGBY league is the pinnacle for players, coaches and administrators, but there will be plenty of suggestions for the next game to break records.

The NRL will be hoping for a similar result this weekend, with the Grand Final set to feature a record-breaking crowd of 74,000.

The game will be the first to sell out in Australia since the Origin series in 2005 and the first time the game has been held in Sydney since 2007.

It is also the first time a club has played a home game in Sydney's ANZ Stadium since November last year, as part of a $1 billion redevelopment.

The NRL's grand final will also be the first to be played in Melbourne after the MCG was upgraded for the showpiece match.

The Melbourne Storm will play the North Queensland Cowboys in the decider, with the match set to be broadcast live on Fox Sports.

The NRL will also look to break market sales records for the game.

The game sold out in record time last year, with the Sydney Roosters playing the Cowboys and the Broncos facing the Gold Coast Titans.

The NRL has not released exact figures for ticket sales or seating capacity, but it has been confirmed that the MCG will be higher than expected."

Police and prosecutors announced a new strategy for stemming the nation's opioid epidemic today, a plan that could quickly make life in Phoenix a little easier for some addicts who have been spending long stretches behind bars.

The plan calls for sentencing enhancement agreements in which a judge, instead of jacking up the sentence for a defendant, would agree to make it easier for the man to get treatment at a drug treatment center. The agreement would also allow the man to stay out of jail and not have to register as a sex offender if he successfully completes the treatment.

It's a strategy that has been used in other cities across the nation, including Phoenix, but only in cases where the defendant is an addict who can't afford to pay for his own treatment.

""We have to realize that we have a big problem that's out of control,"" said Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams, who heads the department's drug unit.

Williams said the goal is to get people off the streets before they commit further crimes.

""We want to get people into treatment and into the community,"" she said. ""This is the only way we are going to control this problem.""

About half of the Phoenix-area's estimated 300,000 residents are addicted to opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The plan, dubbed Project Overdose, follows previous efforts in Orange County, Calif., which has the nation's highest overdose rate among people age 12 and older.

Matthew Baus, an Orange County prosecutor, said the program has helped curb the county's opioid epidemic.

""This is a good and appropriate way to deal with people who are addicted to opioids,"" he said.

The county's overdose rate fell from about 1,100 deaths in 2010 to more than 200 last year.

The new Phoenix program is similar to one in San Diego.

The San Diego program has helped reduce opioid overdoses in that city by 25 percent since 2011, according to the San Diego County District Attorney's Office.

The Phoenix program will be available for addicts who can't afford treatment at a non-profit treatment center, or who have a drug addiction but can't qualify for a treatment program at a non-profit facility.

The program also is designed to help addicts who do not qualify for treatment. The agreement would allow a judge to grant a defendant a misdemeanor diversion or deferred sentence if the defendant successfully completes treatment and pays a $50 fee.

District Attorney Bill Montgomery said it's easier to get addicts treatment than to arrest them and put them behind bars.

""If you are the victim of an opioid overdose, you are not going to go to jail,"" he said. ""The system is not designed for opioids in particular.""

The program could save the county money on other law enforcement costs as"
"Minnesota's Governor Mark Dayton today signed into law a bill that will permit employment discrimination against LGBT people.

House Bill 2554 will allow businesses to deny employment to anyone they feel ""does not share the same fundamental values or lifestyle as the business or its owners.""

This is a devastating piece of legislation, but it has bipartisan support, and is a fairly common occurrence in the state.

House Bill 2554 poses a major threat to LGBT people in Minnesota. It can be used to justify discrimination against the LGBTQ community in a number of ways.

For example, if a restaurant owner is opposed to serving same-sex couples, he can argue that he has a ""sincerely held religious objection to gay marriage.""

This is a very dangerous argument because it allows business owners to refuse to provide services to the LGBTQ community or to provide goods and services at all.

Equality Minnesota noted that the bill ""could potentially result in employees being fired for refusing to participate in a same-sex marriage ceremony, or even for refusing to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding.""

The bill also allows business owners to avoid providing services for same-sex weddings by claiming that they have ""sincerely held religious objections"" to the ceremony.

Although the group argued that the bill is discriminatory, the Governor has plans to veto the bill, and this is a very good sign.

Minnesota is one of 11 states that allows businesses to discriminate against the LGBTQ community; eight of those states are red states.

It is important that we let Governor Dayton know that we don't want him to sign this bill into law.

Governor Dayton should veto House Bill 2554.

As Equality Minnesota stated, ""The right to govern ourselves and the right to live our lives free from discrimination and harassment are fundamental rights in America.""

If you live in Minnesota, contact your representatives and urge them to oppose HB 2554.

Please sign and share the Change.org petition urging Governor Dayton to veto HB 2554."

A few years after I had started this blog, someone asked me about the ""S"" in my blog's name. (The ""s"" didn't exist in the first place.) I was confused, but then I remembered. After the first round of blog changes, I decided to go back to the beginning (to the second sentence) and see, as I wrote several months ago, ""What's the difference between me and you now?""

It turns out that all three versions of the blog are exactly the same person, and that's always been my goal.

"This is the first post in a biweekly series at the website, 'I Don't Want to Grow Up'.

What does it mean to be a young adult? To many, this question might seem rather silly. After all, the term 'young adult' is derived from a Victorian era workbook, and the concept was never far from our modern mind. In fact, 'adolescence' was originally defined as the 'year between the ages of 12-18'. In the 19th century, 'adulthood' was defined to mean the age when adults began to look after children.

But over time, people have shifted their conception of adulthood from 18-24 to somewhere in between. As we've come to understand what it means to grow up, we've often found ourselves moving away from a traditional conception of adulthood to a more global concept. As we move away from a traditional 'adulthood' or 'childhood' conception of adulthood, people have increasingly used phrases which describe people who move between these two views. 'Bridging adulthood,' for example, can be used to describe a person who's aged between 18-24 years old for three years or more.

It's worth noting that the term 'adulthood' is sometimes used by people to describe people who've grown up from children. But for many of us, and indeed many of society's commentators, the term 'adulthood' is now primarily used to describe people who grow up in our society.

For example, to many people, 'adulthood' is primarily used to mean:

An adult who is not 'grown up (adult)' by 21, such as a graduate or a professional

A child who is not 'grown up /child'

In other words, adults who don't have children are in fact 'adulthood', but young people who no longer have children do not qualify as adults. For many, this is a contradiction in terms.

But for others, this paradox remains a puzzle for them. In fact, in some ways this paradox can be used to make sense of modern life, in particular in the role of parents.

The child / youth in adulthood (or child / youth in adulthood) paradox

What do many people mean when they say that the 'adult in society' is one who 'grows up' from childhood to adulthood? For some people who use the term 'adulthood', this means that an adult grows out of childhood. Some people also use the term ""adulthood"" to mean 'childhood' – this is a different sense of the term, though.

Many see 'childhood' as something that belongs to a child. For example, to many people 'childhood' means the physical, social, psychological and emotional development that children experience in infancy and childhood. Thus, their use of the term 'childhood"
"(CNN) — It's not so simple, it seems.

As one of the most powerful men in South American, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has spent her life in politics and often has acted in the interest of the country and her own family. But it's also true that the former first lady and current president has her admirers, and they may not all be fans of the country or the leader.

This man -- who's not a former First Lady -- is one of them.

When Fernandez de Kirchner visited the US, she met President Donald Trump. There were photos, but no formal meeting.

She said afterward that she had ""warm, friendly"" contact with the President.

But then Trump's approval rating took a nosedive. The President's unfavorables are now in the mid-30s, and his disapproval rating has been hovering around half, according to a Gallup poll. (When measured in percentage points, they are similar to Trump's.)

In an interview with Fox News' Neil Cavuto shortly after the announcement of the travel ban -- a temporary ban that bans travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from the United States -- Fernandez de Kirchner said that President Trump had been a ""very good president because he's been a friend"" of the poor.

That's the same argument she's been making all these years.

Navalny, the anti-corruption blogger, has been arrested in Moscow, according to The Guardian. The arrest is interesting because Navalny's views are arguably quite close to those of the Russian elite. He has been called the ""Putin of the Left"" and the ""Putin's spy.""

In April, Navalny called on Russia's United Russia party to break off ties with Putin, citing the fact that Putin had been a party member for more than fifteen years. On May 1, Navalny tweeted:

It is a fact that the Russian president has never been a member of the United Russia party since 1991. His co-founder Alexander Lebedev was a party member from 1990 to 1996.

The timing of Navalny's arrest may be significant: the Kremlin has been attempting to marginalize Navalny, limiting his access to the media and his ability to travel abroad.

Navalny is known for running a successful Internet radio program called ""The New Cold War,"" which attacks the corruption and abuse of power in Russia. He has also written articles in a number of Russian newspapers, including the Novaya Gazeta newspaper. He has even written a book, dubbed ""The Case Against Putin: Exposing Corruption in Russia."""

"" But wait! When you're wearing a mask, it doesn't show whether you're wearing a head or another piece of clothing. So we can be both men and women! "" — Duncan Geere[1]

WoolHead is a form of headwear that grants a player the ability to be both a male or female.[2][3] It cannot be worn by all players, as it must be dyed and equipped to be available. WoolHead can only be found in a world generated with a male or female default.

As of version 1.8 of the Redstone Update, this form no longer has the ability to change gender.

Dye [ edit ]

WoolHead has 22 dyes, three of which are exclusive to WoolHead.

When first obtained, each dye requires the player to craft at least one of its colored blocks. These are crafted using the wool-dye machine, which costs 5.0 wood and 7.0 redstone. Once crafted, any blocks added to the wool and dyed will have their color changed and be colored white.

Dye can be applied using a dye pot, but not via dye-tooltips.

Trivia [ edit ]

When wearing a WoolHead, the player's head will appear shorter and wider compared to the head used in the corresponding female item slot. This may also result in clipping when equipped on a bed, if used with the Headless Horsemann Bed or any of its variants.

WoolHead only can be dyed if at least one dye was used on the block the head was placed on. The only exception is with the Headless Horsemann Bed; the player may still dye anything else with any colors of wool, including woolHead. The Headless Horsemann Bed has another issue where if used with more than one head and any other colored wool, only the last block (the only block that can be dyed) will be dyed."

"A senior Chinese official with knowledge of the discussions confirmed to Reuters that an agreement was struck late last year on the details of the TPP deal. China's Foreign Ministry declined to comment.

But China will find it harder than ever to negotiate a full agreement.

ADVERTISEMENT

Trade experts have argued that a deal with Japan, Canada and six other countries would be more realistic than a partnership with the United States. One major sticking point will be on autos.

The TPP, along with its Japan-backed cousin — the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership — were signed by President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Florida on Friday. But some see the TPP as an inadequate replacement for the ""One China"" policy, which bars bilateral relations between Beijing and Tokyo and prevents Japan from joining the TPP.

Japan's government, however, could still take part in the agreement.

In the TPP talks, Japan, Mexico and Canada were expected to be the next three members to complete. But all three have recently voiced doubts and were also considered less likely to join the TPP once Canada has made its choice.

A deal to finalize the TPP with Canada and Mexico may be finalized later this year; the finalizing of the Japan-led deal with Vietnam is due in 2019.

""Once Canada makes its choice you could expect that Mexico and Japan would be next,"" said one trade veteran and analyst. But he added that the Philippines' recent decision to join the TPP leaves little room for Japan to join.

""Japan is looking for clarity on its future in the TPP but if it doesn't get it, it won't join,"" said the analyst.

Japan has said it wants to negotiate a new free trade pact with the EU, but the White House has said the US will not renegotiate its North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Ottawa to accommodate Japan without giving up much in return.

The TPP deal was finalized at the Obama-Xi meeting in Florida earlier this month, after which Trump traveled to Beijing, where he pledged that the United States remains committed to the 12-country pact.

Trump, who has long touted the benefits of free trade, has said it will cost American jobs. However, Trump and his team have made it clear that they will not put a hard timetable on the completion of a TPP deal.

""I'm going to study it very closely,"" Trump said in Florida."
"Dolphins cornerback Brent Grimes, the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year after the 2012 season, has been suspended for two games without pay by the NFL for violating the league's substance abuse policy, the league announced Friday.

Grimes, 30, was arrested in July on suspicion of suspicion of marijuana possession.

Article continues below...

Grimes became the first NFL safety to be named Defensive Player of the Year after his second season in 2011. He recorded 69 tackles, nine passes defensed and two interceptions.

The Dolphins signed Grimes to a four-year, $35 million contract extension last offseason and were hoping to keep him, but the team was not able to finalize the deal.

Grimes was expected to be the frontrunner for this year's Defensive Player of the Year award. He is expected to be one of the top cornerbacks in free agency, but the Dolphins will likely use the franchise tag on him to keep him, which means a $7.6 million salary for the 2013 season.

I remember when I was a kid, I remember sitting in my bedroom in a red sweater, reading a book named, ""The Boy Who Lived."" I was twelve years old and I was immersed in a book that was about an orphan boy who lived with his mother. He could not speak, but he could obviously do everything a normal human being could do. He was a genius. A genius who, though he knew very little, was very smart. I am not sure how, but somehow, some way, I became obsessed with him. In fact, I think I was so obsessed with him that I started to believe in him and I believed in him so much that I decided to write a book about him. The book was called ""The Boy Who Lived"" and it is about a twelve year old boy who lives with his mother and is a genius. I loved the book so much, I wrote a sequel, ""The Boy Who Lived Returns."" I thought this would be a great book to introduce kids to an intelligent, brilliant boy. I was wrong.

So, I am now eighteen and I have been living in Nashville, Tennessee with my boyfriend of three years for the last four months. We met in college and he was from Florida. We were both in our first year of college and he was a good friend of mine. We took a trip to Nashville and he was staying at my apartment for an extended period of time while I was at work. We wrote a book together and it was a white-hot success. I loved it so much that I decided to put it out on my own and I decided to use the name, ""The Boy Who Lived."" I loved how successful it was, but I was also so impressed by the fact that my book was a success. It was a hit, a runaway hit, but I was still so impressed by the fact that people loved it. I thought my book was fabulous and it was a book that I wanted to write.

I had a lot of success, but I was still always a little bit disappointed and I still felt that I had to improve. I needed to write better. I needed to write a better book. I needed to write a better story. I felt that I was doing really well. I had made a decent amount of money from my book, but I was still not satisfied. I was still too satisfied with how successful my book was. I was still just happy to be writing books.

"Many have argued that the CIA's torture program was a major contributor to al Qaeda's rise. Now it appears that the same agency also helped to create the group.

In a new report, The New York Times reveals that the CIA recruited an al Qaeda operative in 2004 and then watched him develop into a key al Qaeda operative.

The operative, Abu Zubaydah, was detained in Pakistan and transferred to CIA custody in 2006. Zubaydah was interrogated by the agency in the years following his capture and was subjected to a series of harsh techniques, including sleep deprivation, confinement in boxes, waterboarding and forced nudity.

Zubaydah's interrogation was conducted by the CIA's SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) program, which was based on the brutal interrogation techniques used by the U.S. Army at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, the Times reports.

According to the report, Zubaydah was a ""potential al Qaeda courier."" But he was ""small, malnourished and sickly,"" and the CIA began to suspect he was lying about his role in the organization.

Instead of continuing to interrogate Zubaydah, the CIA decided to take him to a secret prison known as the ""Salt Pit,"" which was run by the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command.

The Salt Pit was the first CIA prison, where the agency detained terrorists and both bin Laden and al Qaeda operatives. The Salt Pit was also used for the detention and interrogation of a suspected 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

The Times found that Zubaydah was not the only detainee the CIA tortured at the Salt Pit.

The Times' report states that there was another detainee at the Salt Pit who was ""indispensable to the C.I.A.'s effort to find Osama bin Laden but who fell into the agency's hands through a series of missteps.""

According to the Times, the detainee was held for more than a year, but was released after the CIA learned he was a ""high-value target,"" meaning he had been identified as an al Qaeda member.

CIA officials then handed him over to the military for interrogation.

The Times report comes just a week after the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a heavily redacted version of its report on the CIA's torture program, which a number of members, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said the committee's ""redactions are too much, too soon.""

The report concluded that the use of enhanced interrogation methods — including waterboarding — was ineffective and likely led to the deaths of a number of detainees.

This article has been updated to reflect the news that the CIA has confirmed that Abu Zubaydah was not its first detainee."

"A man accused of attacking a Sikh man in a store in a suburban Detroit grocery store last week is the brother of a man who left behind a letter that called on white people to kill ""their own kind.""

Police said Sunday that the brother of the store's owner is the person accused in the attack at the Sterling Market on Friday morning. Darryl Jones, 22, allegedly shoved 42-year-old Sita Singh, a Sikh man, in the groin area and then started hitting him with an egg carton.

The incident happened as Singh was buying a sandwich at the grocery store on a busy Saturday. A second store employee, 55-year-old Rishi Kapoor, intervened to help Singh and detained Jones as other shoppers ran off. Police said Singh and Kapoor were not charged in the case.

The attack shocked many who knew Singh and described him as a quiet individual who cared more about his religious practice than for his physical well-being.

""He is my best friend for 30 years,"" Singh's wife, Bhavani, told CBS Detroit. ""He is the only person in my family that speaks the language.""

Singh had a few minor scrapes and bruises to his face, according to police, but did not need medical attention. Police said Singh told them he didn't realize that his attacker was the store's owner and was initially attacked over his bag as he passed. He said he did not know the man, was unaware of his racial background and was merely passing through.

The family also expressed surprise that no one from the store's managers has been arrested in the case.

""He's been an employee here for 10 years…and we thought there would be someone to come take care of it,"" Singh's son Shubham Singh told the Detroit Free Press, adding that the two people at the store's counter that day, a manager and a cashier, were quick to help Singh.

According to the letter Kapoor left behind, he called on people who supported white supremacy to ""hunt down, kill and maim"" his family and neighbors.

""These are the kind of things the people with a long white history will do,"" Kapoor wrote in the letter, which was reportedly in response to comments Kapoor received on Facebook.

The Michigan chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations denounced the attack and the letter, calling it ""despicable,"" the Detroit News reported.

Kapoor's attorney did not immediately return a request for comment. Jones did not immediately return a phone message from the Detroit Free Press on Sunday evening.

The two men are close and often shop at grocery stores together, including the one that was targeted in the attack. Singh's aunt, Lala Kaur, told the Detroit Free Press that the two men often spent time at the store together and often had arguments over a woman.

"After more than a year of preparation, the Supreme Court on Monday issued the first-ever case-by-case review of Section 377, the colonial-era law that criminalizes homosexuality.

The court's order, on a petition filed by the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA) and the gay rights group Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG) in June 2014, came before a packed courtroom for the first time. The case was filed under Section 13 of the Constitution, which provides for ""public and private"" individuals to ""habituate private and family matters and to raise their children.""

This case is the first time the Supreme Court has had to determine whether Section 377, which was enacted in 1967, violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws.

It also is the first time that the court has made such a broad decision, and it may have to twice revisit the question. Civil rights advocates and NGOs, who have long argued that Section 377 discriminates against homosexual people, will likely appeal against the court's decision in the case.

The court's ruling in the case, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C., will require the government to consider the public interest in decriminalizing homosexuality and to take into account the social and economic costs of enforcing a law that they say is often misused or misinterpreted.

""The court recognizes the right to privacy and the importance of protecting the privacy of individuals in their own homes and personal relationships,"" Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority of the court, wrote. ""But that right does not give anyone the right to enter the home of another, to do what they will with the bodies of others, to do what they will with their intimate lives. Those are concerns for society at large, not for a couple beset by infidelity. It is the right of the individual and society at large to define marriage, and to regulate it.""

Section 377 is one of the most controversial sections of the criminal code in Uganda.

In the case, the CJA and SMUG argued that the law violates the right to privacy, which is recognized in Article 21 of the Uganda Constitution, as well as the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation under the Anti-Discrimination Act of 2009. The two groups also argued that the law violated the right to freedom of speech and expression.

""For us, the line between private and public life is an important one, and it should be respected,"" SMUG Campaign Coordinator Mufi Abebe told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""This case is about marriage, and the right to have a relationship that is a very private and intimate one. It is not about public and private life. It is about the right of the individual to define their relationship.""

Abebe said the court's decision is ""a long time coming,"" and is a ""long-overdue"
"Want to get a jump on the coming season to follow?

The newly-formed LAFC has made a couple of moves over the past week.

First, the club announced the signing of former LA Galaxy and Manchester City defender Jose Villarreal as its first Designated Player. The 27-year-old Villarreal joins the club on loan from El Tri, meaning he will not return to his native Mexico after the MLS season concludes.

""I'm really excited to be coming to Major League Soccer and join the LA Galaxy,"" Villarreal said in a club statement. ""The opportunity to play in front of the LA Galaxy fans and be a part of the beginning of their brand new stadium will be a great experience.

""I have a lot of respect for the way they treat their players and I'm looking forward to getting to work and helping the team win games.""

Villarreal's pedigree is impressive. He has spent the last three seasons with El Tri, where he started all but one of his team's appearances. Villarreal has spent the entire last three years with Monterrey, where he has been a key member of the El Tri backline. He made his senior debut in the 2011 Copa America Centenario.

The defender is a regular in the Mexican national team set up, and was a member of the team's Gold Cup squad in 2016.

The Galaxy also announced Saturday that they have re-signed midfielder José Villarreal. — LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) December 11, 2016

Villarreal, 28, joins the LA Galaxy after playing four seasons with Manchester City and West Ham United. He spent two seasons with Manchester City before joining El Tri in 2013, where he has made 115 appearances for the team.

The defender also won the FIFPro World XI award for the best defender in the last six seasons. He was named to the 2016-17 Best XI for the second consecutive year.

Villarreal is the second signing for LAFC, who signed defender Leonardo."

"It's hard to imagine any other city in the country with more cultural traditions than Las Vegas, so finding out how the nation's sixth most populous metropolis got its nickname ""Las Vegas"" and the history behind that has the Las Vegas Weekly's Ryan Kail.

We talked to Kail about the history of the town, the history of the city itself, and a bit about the history of ""Las Vegas.""

You've said the nickname is an urban legend. How do you know?

I'm pretty sure we're not the first to use the word ""Las Vegas."" The word ""Las Vegas"" was first used in the 1930s by Walter Cronkite on his broadcast. There's no other city in the world, even on this side of the Atlantic, that would use its name as a synonym for its own city.

The name is also a play on the English capital word ""Las,"" which means ""the king,"" which is very fitting. It was the King of England who ruled through the 1500s and 1600s because he came across the desert to the west and started to build up an empire. The name is not a ""joke"" in any way, shape or form. It was used for a city for about 200 years and was used in the early 1800s in the form of ""LAS Vegas,"" which means ""The King's City.""

Where did the nickname come from?

The first mention of Las Vegas as a name in print comes from the 1870 ""The Vegas Review"" published by the Las Vegas Herald Tribune. It is an ad for an insurance policy that included the phrase ""I must now take my ball back, as it will not be possible to continue playing this sport."" So even from the 1800s, it's very hard to understand how the nickname was coined. It could have been a combination of ""Las"" and the king of England's name. Or a person could have seen a circus coming down the road and then thought ""the most likely thing to happen is that the Circus will come to Las Vegas.""

What exactly is a ""circus"" anyway?

A circus came to Las Vegas on Feb. 2, 1864, during the Gold Rush of California. A large wagon train loaded with all sorts of goods including silver, gold and jewels, left San Francisco on Jan. 1. It went east on Highway 95 and stopped at Salt Lake City on Jan. 6. The caravan of wagons consisted of a circus that was holding its circus show at Las Vegas. It was at that time that the ""circus show"" was known as ""The Las Vegas Show"" because of the large crowd that came out to see the show.

What is the history behind the construction of the ""Circus Circus"" and its famous rides?

In 1866, a company called the California Tourist Association set about building an amusement park in California"
"Duke Energy Corporation today announced it will build two coal-fired power plants in Wyoming as the company seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Duke Energy will pay $2.5 billion to buy 100,000 acres of public lands in southwestern Wyoming in order to build the Wabash Station generating complex. The plant will power 2,300,000 West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana homes; all of which will benefit from an economic boost associated with the plant. The investment will also help address climate change by reducing emissions globally.

""Wyoming has demonstrated in recent months that it is a great state with a tremendous energy potential,"" said Denny Crothers, President and CEO of Duke Energy in North Carolina. ""With Duke Energy in position to buy land to build a new coal-fired power plant, we are hopeful that other states in our region will explore this option, and also consider other opportunities and investment opportunities.""

The Wabash Station will be built at a cost of approximately $6 billion and will replace plants at the shuttered Elk Creek Power Station that are at risk of closure under state regulations. This project is expected to generate enough electricity to power nearly 1 million homes.

The project will benefit from a variety of investment and job creation opportunities for rural communities in Wyoming and other neighboring states. Since Duke Energy purchased Wabash's assets in 2012, the company has expanded its portfolio to include 10 other coal-fired power plant projects, including projects in Michigan, Indiana and Nebraska, and expanded its U.S. natural gas resources portfolio to include a new large-scale natural gas facility. More information on these projects is available at www.dukeenergy.com/coal.

Duke Energy is investing in clean energy sources and supporting a diversified local economy in West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois and Ohio through its power generation, transmission, sales, and service markets. West Virginia and Indiana, both top manufacturing states, are expected to become energy engines.

""When new coal- and gas-fired power plants are built and deployed throughout our region, more American manufacturers will continue to grow and bring jobs,"" said U.S. Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Delaware, chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power. ""I look forward to continuing to work with the U.S. Department of Energy and the Trump administration to make America energy competitive again.""

""This project, like all of Duke Energy's other projects, is part of our commitment to a safe, clean energy economy,"" said Duke Energy President and CEO Lynn Good. ""I'm excited that we're building a low-carbon coal and gas-fired power plant to ensure our operations are consistent with the safety and reliability standards we've developed over nearly a century. I'm also pleased that by partnering with local landowners, we'll be able to provide landowners with a return on their investment that"
"Mixed

Mixed is an early form of the mixed family in which all the characters have different heights. In the family, the youngest and oldest kids are the tallest. The middle is next in line, and, if they are on top of the stack, the one below them is the youngest. The bottom is the youngest, and so on. The oldest is, in this family, the tallest.

Note: Even though Mixed has the same parent characters as BOTH-AL and OLDER, because of their age and the fact that they are not the parents of all the children, they do not show all character heights as they would in the case of their counterparts in each of these other families.

These characters are not sorted by a particular height or the number of children present in each household. All the families include every family except for MIXED (other than ALL-ALL).

In this type of family, the middle child and the youngest will always have the same height."
"When a man in the United States dies from a gunshot wound to the head, the first thing the police do is look for guns.

But when a man in Germany dies from a gunshot wound to the head, the police don't look for guns at all. On Sunday night, police in the southern German city of Dusseldorf refused to investigate a report that a man had fired several shots into the air.

It is not known if the man who fired the shots was a criminal or not. And whether he was a practicing Muslim or not, it seems unlikely that his actions were motivated by religion.

The man was not even identified by name at the time of the shooting. But people immediately started calling him ""the terrorist"".

The police are usually quick to investigate such reports, but the Dusseldorf police said it would not launch an investigation.

A police spokesman said: ""The police will not conduct a formal investigation and we will not call him a terrorist.""

His alleged actions were ""completely unrelated to terrorism,"" the spokesman added.

German police are trained to look for real criminals and serious criminals only. It seems that they do not want to use their armed forces to protect the public from another man who has just committed a crime.

At least one German politician has called for the police to be armed with guns.

Ira Heck, president of the German Police Union, said the police must have guns.

""The police must be able to protect the people,"" he said.

""It's not right that the police can't protect the people.""

Germany is a highly militarized police state. Hundreds of soldiers patrol the streets of Dusseldorf.

In the United States there are more than 300,000 police officers. They are not allowed to carry guns and are not trained to do so.

It is not clear if the man in Dusseldorf was armed.

It is well known that the Dusseldorf police have been under constant attack from far-left groups and other anti-police groups over the years.

As a result, most German police forces today do not carry guns.

In the United States, police forces have never been allowed to carry guns.

Germany's police are also highly militarized. The Freedom Party (FPO) in Germany's Parliament has called for a ban on police wearing uniforms that show any military insignia or insignias.

This would mean that police officers in Germany would have to wear uniforms that do not show any military insignia or insignias.

The FPO says that this would force the police to dress in the same way as the army, which is also extremely militarized.

The FPO and other anti-police groups in Germany have been very successful in portraying police officers as ""racist"" and ""violent"
"Seahawks coach Pete Carroll isn't interested in a rematch of his Super Bowl-winning squad, and neither is Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, according to one of the quarterbacks on that team.

""You don't want to play them three times,"" Wilson told ESPN Radio host Chris Mortensen. ""But I'm sure we'll find someone.""

Wilson's comments in support of that statement came after Mortensen revealed that ""four"" current players from 2012 are interested in meeting with Carroll in January.

Mortensen said that he's also aware that former Seahawks linebacker Mike Morgan, a member of that team, is looking at a Super Bowl return. He didn't specifically name Morgan, but he's got a point. Morgan played nine years for the Cardinals under defensive coordinator Todd Bowles before joining the Seahawks in 2011. Morgan has been out of football for years, as the Ravens brought him back this season to coach the defensive line, but he would be welcome back into the NFL.

Mortensen also said that former Seahawks cornerback Brandon Browner is interested in making a return to the NFL, as well.

""I don't want to be in that position again with the Seahawks and be on the field,"" he said. ""But I'm definitely going to give it another shot."""
"The next major update brings a huge new feature, a brand new game mode and of course some changes and balance tweaks. The last update was a huge one, bringing a ton of features like the first ranked season on a non-P1X server, and also some balancing tweaks that will make every round a little bit more important. The update also brings a ton of new content, so let's check everything out in detail, shall we.

New Content

New map (Mall): The MALL map is back with a huge update! While it initially had a very similar layout to the P1X map with a giant fountain, the map is now much more complicated, with multiple different paths and locations. It also feels a lot different to play as it feels more like a normal map rather than a map made specifically to get you and your team into the game quickly. Also included is a new type of player card (for an update soon, more on these soon!) that replaces the normal player cards with a 3D model of a player and a weapon model for each player. This model is also placed on an item card, like the normal player cards, and there are many more different types of items and upgrades scattered around the map.


New Game Mode: The BOUNTY BLOCK GAME MODE has been implemented, where you can battle to see who can destroy the most player cards (you can still win by destroying everything). This mode has a variety of rules, such as a set number of turns before the game ends (instead of a number of turns), and also has a random element to it, making the game much more unpredictable. The game mode also works the same for both sides with more twists to it, so it should add a lot of fun and interesting situations when playing in this mode.

The following update was also made available for 1.5.1 (released on June 3rd):

Balance

A lot of balance changes were made after the launch of the game and this update only goes to update 2.1, so not many changes were made on the P1X server this time. Some major changes are as follows:

Player cards: As previously mentioned, the new player cards are replaced with 3D models of players, and now there are many different types, giving more opportunities in different game modes and allowing for many different team compositions.

Player card (Item card): This card replaces the normal player cards, and now there are many different types, giving more opportunities when playing in this mode where items are placed on the Map as well as giving access to better items.

Player cards (Pulse Card and Plasma Beam): These cards have been updated and now allow for much more team synergy with new special abilities and special weapons. As a side note, while weapons can now be upgraded, weapons still lose a lot of value after a certain point in the game, so you should"
"""The fact is there's too much money in politics, in too many places,"" Obama said earlier this week, according to Bloomberg. ""And I think there's a case to be made that in some cases it may actually undermine the democratic process and make it more difficult for our government to solve our problems.""

The issue has recently gained visibility as the Supreme Court considers what to do with an early primary-season primary in Montana, which would let a wealthy Republican donor pay for the votes of dozens – or potentially hundreds – of lesser-known campaign workers. In another case, Citizens United, the court found that corporations and unions could spend limitless sums on independent expenditures in federal elections, which are made without coordination with candidates or their campaigns.

The Montana court case, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, has been closely watched by campaign-finance watchdogs for its potential legal and political influence.

Campaign-finance reformers were outraged that McCutcheon could allow for unlimited donations from individuals to candidates and party committees. Even though the majority of Americans oppose the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, polls have shown broad support among the public for campaign-finance limits.

""Even though we disagree with the court on this key issue, we hope that this case will go the distance, bring much-needed accountability to campaign fund-raising and help limit the corrosive influence of wealth and special interests in politics,"" said Michael Beckel, executive director of the Public Campaign Action Fund, in a statement.

""To ensure that this debate is not diverted by narrow issues, including who might benefit from new restrictions on campaign contributions, we expect to file an amicus brief that will be presented Monday afternoon in the appeal hearing,"" Beckel added.


In light of McCutcheon's appeal, both the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) called in a joint brief to the Supreme Court to argue against campaign-finance restrictions. The Chamber's executive vice president of tax and accounting said the new case will cause a ""chilling effect"" and hinder the process of governing.

McCutcheon v. FEC was filed by two groups, the conservative Federalist Society and the Democratic-leaning Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber argued that, for an individual donation to an individual candidate or to political committees, any total donations may violate limits on donations.

""As the court has repeatedly recognized, the First Amendment guarantees an individual's right to participate in elections,"" the Supreme Court brief said in its opposition to the McCutcheon challengers.

""This means that an individual may not be punished because he or she makes the choice to contribute to a particular candidate or committee, regardless of how much is donated,"" the brief maintained.


On July 16, a majority of the court issued an order for the lower court to reconsider after denying an earlier request.

Earlier in the day, the actor had apologised to his fans after the authorities refused to give them a reason for the withdrawal of his passport that was imposed on Monday.

""I'm sorry to my fellow artists that my passport, which I was planning to perform in Malaysia, has been cancelled and that my trip to Malaysia has been canceled,"" he said. ""I am trying to return to India to perform after all these events have occurred.""

"YOUNGSTOWN — When the first of two high school graduations for The Village Skate Shop was held today, the small shop on the corner of East State Street and Euclid Avenue was bustling with excitement.

""It was the most wonderful day of my life,"" said Barbara Cattano, who was born in the Village and has lived in Youngstown for 56 years. ""I couldn't have been more proud to be a part of it.""

The special event marked the second time in a year that Cattano and her husband, Tony, who is a veteran of the Army, were able to watch their son graduate from the Skate Shop, their local institution for skateboarding.

""I knew it was going to be special,"" said Tony, who is 70 percent blind. ""I knew we would be able to do something special.""

Before the ceremony, Tony Cattano showed his son, Andrew, a video about the Skate Shop and its history.

""I was able to watch the video that night, and I was in tears,"" said Andrew, who was born in the Village. ""It was a very special day.""

The Skate Shop celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2010, and was opened in 1965 by Tony and his brother, Joe. Tony Cattano started working for the shop in 1965 and the business has been in his family ever since.

""It's just a name we picked out of the box,"" he said.

The Skate Shop is the largest skateboard shop in Ohio, and is one of the oldest in the country. It also is one of only a handful of shops in Ohio that still make custom skateboards and sell them to the general public.

""We're crazy about the community,"" said Tony Cattano, who can remember when he was a boy and saw his brother Joe skateboarding on the streets of Youngstown that first summer.

Beside the shop, the Skate Shop offers a skatepark for kids, where they can ride a two-wheel skateboard. The shop also has an impressive collection of skateboards, where Tony and his wife, Barbara, have purchased some of the most iconic skateboards in the country, including the Benelli, Magma, Bamboozler and Nike Air Max.

""It's a family business, and we're just so proud of it,"" Tony Cattano said. ""We love the people who work here, we love the customers, and we just enjoy being a part of the community.""

The Skate Shop is always open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.

Eisman admitted to accessing the company's computers from October 2011 to November 2012 and copying confidential information on its system.

After Eisman was caught, he turned over to his former employer 10 terabytes of information he had stolen from the company. In court during a probation examination, a defense attorney noted Eisman's job was to manage access to the company's systems and asked Judge G. Todd Baugh if he should be given supervised release.

""If you've got to be at an Internet cafe for 10 hours a day for months to access the networks and all that stuff, if you need to have access [for] an active job, I think you just might need to be under supervision,"" Baugh told the defense lawyer at the time.

But prosecutors are charging Eisman with two counts of cyberstalking to intimidate someone by engaging in criminal harassment and one count of attempted identity theft.

Under cyberstalking and attempted identity theft, Eisman is accused of engaging in a pattern of harassment against his ex-employer.

Authorities also filed an affidavit with the court saying Eisman created an online persona using the name of his former employer's ""internet security specialist"" and used this persona to engage in online conversations with the company and its employees, asking questions about security settings, the company's security plan and other technical issues.

The online conversations are alleged to have taken place from July 18, 2012, to November 18, 2012. The conversations are alleged to have included the company sending Eisman technical support requests, and in one instance Eisman allegedly made requests to access confidential company information.

During the November 2012 conversations, Eisman allegedly asked employees of the company if they are the ""real Internet security specialist,"" as well as if they know the names of the company's CIO, vice president of computer networks and information technology, assistant vice president of computer networks and information technology, and assistant vice president of information and internal systems.

He also asked the employees, ""Who are these guys who run the company's security, who are these people that run the network, who do they hang out with?"" and asked about the ""status"" of his job in the company.

The affidavit alleged Eisman also accessed the company's servers and made unauthorized changes to company files. Eisman allegedly said he'd be able to download a substantial amount of data.

Dear Mr. President:

We are writing to express our deep concern about the potential impact of the administration's proposed budget cuts on medical research and on the ability of scientists to conduct research at universities, and to express our hope that your administration will recognize the need to invest in medical research and continue to expand it regardless of tax policy.

We are grateful for the work of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which provides vital funding for biomedical research. The NIH is also the largest single funder of biomedical research in the United States, and it encompasses the entire spectrum of biomedical research, including basic, translational, clinical, and basic education research. NIH also supports a wide range of other academic and other non-profit organizations that contribute to biomedical research.

The NIH's mission is to ""promote, through research and education, the health of all Americans, including the nation's most vulnerable populations."" The NIH provides grants to support the largest research projects in medicine, including the discovery of new drugs, new treatments, and cures for deadly diseases. The NIH also supports clinical trials and training of future medical professionals. Over the past 15 years, the NIH has provided nearly $30 billion in awards to support biomedical research.

No one disputes the need to support biomedical research. However, the proposed budget cuts to NIH-funded research would set back medical research for decades, and would put at risk the advances that have been made over the past century.

The NIH is the nation's largest single funder of medical research and the largest single funder of medical education and training. The NIH's institutional structure is designed to enable the federal government to support the most competitive and innovative biomedical researchers in the United States.

Research supports biomedical research that leads to medical breakthroughs. The NIH is a ""home"" for NIH-funded biomedical research, and the NIH's funding is the largest single funder of biomedical research in the United States.

The NIH employs more than 5,000 scientists and has an annual budget of about $30 billion. This supports more than 5,000 researchers around the United States, including more than 2,000 at the NIH institutes and centers.

The NIH's mission of promoting the health of all Americans is as important to the nation as its ability to produce great scientific discoveries.

The proposed budget cuts to NIH research would disrupt the research community, and would harm the nation's future by delaying medical breakthroughs for decades.

The NIH operates independently of the executive branch and the Congress in order to achieve efficiency and effectiveness. NIH funding is provided under the authority of the National Institutes of Health Act, enacted in 1950. The NIH Act is amended by numerous statutes. The NIH was established to promote the health of the nation, and the NIH Act was enacted"
"Mr. Rooney's proposal could be the first of its kind in the nation, and the first of its kind in a major city. Other cities have tried to help people who are homeless, but they are rarely as ambitious as Mr. Rooney's plan.

""I think this is a great idea,"" said Christopher C. Lopez, the director of the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty, a nonprofit organization. ""It's a powerful way to get people off the street.""

In the first year, roughly 20,000 homeless people will be helped through the program, or more than 10 percent of the city's estimated homeless population of more than 42,000. The city will cover the cost of services provided to the people who are helped, a cost that, officials said, will be comparable to what it would cost to provide such services to people who are not homeless.

Mr. Rooney said he had been inspired to make the proposal by listening to the stories of people he had met who had lost their homes and were living in cars and shelters. He said he had often felt frustrated and powerless in trying to help them. ""I knew we had to come up with something that would be easy to implement and doable,"" he said.

The plan also includes funding for services to help people who are homeless manage their finances and to help them obtain jobs.

The city's plan is not without critics. Some say it could cost more than it saves, and they worry that the program could actually create more homelessness.

""It's a good idea, but it's not the right idea,"" said Joe Borelli, a spokesman for the Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit organization. If the program is limited to people who are homeless, he said, ""it will be a threat to the public health.""

In the first year, the program will provide about $14 million in services to people who are homeless. The city plans to spend an additional $11 million on a monitoring system to track how well the program is working.

The city is also working with the state's Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services on a pilot program that would provide housing vouchers to homeless people who have relatives in or near the city.

"Fertilizer Use, Part 3 – The Impact of Fertilizer on Climate Change

The world is now in the midst of a major global population growth crisis. This is a problem that is faced when the world's population grows, but for which there are no easy solutions. One of the key reasons that population growth is a problem is that it causes both environmental and economic problems that are not easily solved or eliminated.

The most obvious environmental impact of population growth is that it increases the number of people using the Earth's resources. This is the primary impact of population growth on the environment. The world's population is forecast to increase from 7.3 billion in 1990 to 9.4 billion in 2050. To put that in perspective, Africa will add nearly a third of the world's population by 2050 and Asia will add nearly a quarter of the world's population by 2050.

The growth of the world's population will also cause major environmental problems. The demand for resources will grow significantly faster than the ability of the Earth to provide them. For example, the developed world's population is expected to increase from about 3.5 billion in 1990 to 5.3 billion in 2050, but the amount of land available for agriculture will decrease by more than half from its 1990 rate. This means that the number of people growing crops for food will increase from 23 million in 1990 to nearly 60 million in 2050.

This increase in the demand for food will lead to a significant change in our food production system. For example, the average American will eat about 6.5 pounds of beef per year by 2050. However, the number of cattle in the United States is predicted to decline by 50 percent from its 1990 rate by 2050. As a result, Americans will have to eat more beans and beans will become the most important crop in the United States. The process is similar to how the number of cars on the road has increased dramatically over the past few decades, and as a result, the number of miles the average American drives has also increased dramatically.

The impact of population growth on the environment will also lead to a major population growth crisis in the developed world. In the United States, the population grew by 1.8 percent between 1990 and 2000, but it will continue to increase by about 0.6 percent annually between 2000 and 2050. Similarly, in Britain, the population grew by 0.7 percent between 1990 and 2000, but it will continue to increase by about 1.4 percent annually between 2000 and 2050. This will lead to major population growth in Europe, which will be well over 10 percent by 2050.

This population growth crisis will also have a major impact on the environment. In the United States, the average American will use about 3.5 kilograms of fertilizer per year by 2050, whereas this will increase to more than 6 kilograms in Britain. This growth in fertilizer use will cause a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. In fact,"
"How much do you know about the history of the modern American flag? Well, at least as far as the American Civil Liberties Union is concerned, you probably don't know nearly enough.

During the group's ""We Stand for the Flag"" day, the ACLU issued a handy guide that makes the case for why the flag is so important to Americans.

Here's a look at some of the highlights:

1. The American flag was designed to protect, not to impress.

The ACLU says in its guide, ""There is nothing sacred about patriotism: To be patriotally American, you simply have to have the right to express yourself, to speak freely, and to oppose unjust authority.""

2. The American flag has been on display for hundreds of years.

""If the history of the United States is any predictor, the American flag is about to get even more powerful,"" the guide continues. ""It is about to be a force for good.""


3. The American flag became the country's official symbol after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation -- which also was the first written endorsement of the equality of all men and women in the United States.


4. The American flag is a symbol of the country's ""indivisible union.""


""The stars and stripes represents the union of all Americans, whatever their race, religion, sex, or language,"" the guide says. ""This symbol is central to many Americans' sense of their citizenship.""


5. It's the nation's only national symbol of political unity.


While many cities across the country have ""loyalty"" or ""community"" flags, the official flag of the United States is the only one used by the federal government for official use. The only other national symbol, the American eagle, belongs to the government and is used by local police departments in an honorary capacity.


6. The flag's official colors are blue and white.


The ACLU says that it is ""time and time again"" that ""blue and white"" flag symbols have been used to ""express the most basic notions of democracy.""


7. The flag's most widely recognized image? The star of David.


The book's preface says the star of David is the most commonly adopted design of the flag, although it has been used by various cultures for centuries. The preface offers further history and more symbolism, and the book was compiled by an organization called the Committee for the Preservation of the American Flag and its History.


8. The flag is still the subject of intense dispute among Americans.

The ACLU guide says that its flag is constantly being ""attacked on the right as the symbol of America's political enemies, from communists to racists to gay rights activists."" But on the left, flag enthusiasts say they're being ""persecuted"" by right-wing groups. The booklet quotes"

"The National Republicans' Florida Senate candidate says Confederate statues should be moved to museums. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo)

A Republican candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in Florida says Dylann Roof, the man accused of killing nine people in a South Carolina church, should not have been allowed to buy a gun because the state's Confederate statues should not have been removed from public display.

State Sen. Frank Artiles said Sunday that the Confederate statues of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson should be moved to museums.

""We need to have a conversation about these issues, we need to have a conversation about the fact that we have these statues in our state,"" Artiles told the Miami Herald. ""People are so afraid to have a conversation about it. It's hard to have a conversation when you're afraid of the other side or the left.""

Artiles did not respond to requests for comment, but was one of the top three GOP candidates for the state Senate seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown. Artiles is backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC funded by the Republican Party.

Artiles told the paper that some people are against removing the statues because they are part of their heritage. ""I say we should just leave 'em up,"" Artiles said. ""We don't need to go stomp them.""

Artiles, who is black, is running against former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz, who is Puerto Rican, in the Aug. 30 primary election.

Artiles, who was mayor of Miami for two years between 2003 and 2006, is a member of the GOP's congressional leadership. He also served as Miami-Dade County's state chairman.

Artiles' comments come after the massacre at a South Carolina church last week during which Roof, 21, is accused of killing nine black parishioners and a woman.

Roof's mother, sister and aunt are also accused of helping him buy a gun."
"The former Manchester United star's first year as coach of Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala was a disaster, reports say

Roman Abramovich will miss the start of next season due to health reasons, the Russian businessman has confirmed.

The Chelsea owner, who was forced to end his year-long sabbatical to be treated for an anxiety disorder late last year, revealed in April that he would spend the next 12 months away from the business of Arsenal amid allegations that he tried to cover up a £1.5m loss.

Abramovich, 59, is set to return to the sidelines in January after having surgery on a minor leg injury in Moscow in early June.

""After my return from Europe to be treated, the doctors explained my health situation and that I needed time to completely recover,"" he told the Russian business daily Kommersant.

""The same doctors confirmed that I require at least 12 months out of work from sport and the same duration from business activities.

""My health condition is not entirely a mystery, as has been pointed out in many letters to me. I will need to work from the beginning of next year, and we will make a decision as early as possible.""

As reported by Goal.com, Abramovich left the football-mad Russian capital for the clinic near St Petersburg to be examined at length by a doctor from a British hospital, a decision which the tycoon claimed was ""100% a business deal"" that was aimed at reducing his personal stress.

The Russian newspaper Kommersant had claimed in a May 3 report that his return would be delayed until September 2015, while Abramovich's spokeswoman claimed the Chelsea owner's plans had always been to return later in the year.

That changed earlier this month. Chelsea spokesman Mike Phelan said at the time that the club was ""hopeful"" that Abramovich's return could be made ""as soon as possible."""
"Funny thing is that, while I haven't actually been to the Middle East, I've been reading all of the literature on this region. For example, here is a summary of events since the Arab Spring, in 2010:

1. ""Egypt's former president Hosni Mubarak is in jail after more than two years on trial for complicity in the killing of protesters and journalists, a move denounced by Western governments and human rights groups who accused him of trampling on protesters' and journalists' rights during the unrest...The crackdown by authorities...has driven more than two million people from their homes into the desert. Tens of thousands of those who could be considered to be at risk of becoming protesters, including thousands living in the remote, hard-to-access northern part of the country, have been forcibly removed from their homes or forced into exile."" – New York Times (Oct. 21, 2010).

2. ""President Hosni Mubarak is on trial for charges that he engineered the deaths of protesters during the uprising and then used torture to secure confessions…[The defendants] include two Egyptian soldiers who were tried on charges of murdering 15 protesters. They are awaiting a retrial after a judge ruled that the military's legal system was being used to convict the soldiers. In April, the Egyptian government passed a law that requires judges to convict soldiers by a preponderance of evidence, a higher standard than is required in a criminal case."" – New York Times (May 4, 2011).

3. ""Tens of thousands of Egyptians have been forced to leave their homes, or been relocated to camps, under a sweeping crackdown on the uprising that began in January last year. Tens of thousands have been forcibly removed, some to other countries, as the government says it is seeking to protect national security. Most of the Egyptians who remain have been forced into squalid camps for internally displaced people. At least three million Egyptians have been displaced by the turmoil, according to the United Nations.

""The government's decision to relocate hundreds of thousands of people to camps in the desert and on the other side of the Nile has been fiercely criticized as a violation of human rights, especially by those who were either targeted in the violent crackdown or are refugees."" – New York Times (Oct. 22, 2011).

Now, let's take a moment to consider the fact that, on all of these counts, Morsi is more or less in the same situation as Mubarak was when he was overthrown with the help of the West.

For example, Mubarak had been ruling Egypt for thirty five years (1953-2011). He had spent more than twenty-two of them as an Army general. So, yes, we had to overthrow him, but he was still a dictator, and he was still doing a lot of good things. His economy was doing well despite the cost of the embargo and his support for Israel. You couldn't just say, ""No more."""

"The New York Times recently ran a piece on the improbability of Israel's continued existence. The piece was authored by journalist and longtime Israeli insider Dan Margalit, who has spent the past few years going after the ""normies"" and ""cuckservatives"" in the Israeli right.

Margalit's piece is a classic example of what one Israeli journalist described to me as ""the Israeli response to the 'normies' in the country."" In particular, Margalit's piece is a fine example of ""the Israeli Israel lobby's attempt to make Israel seem normal by showing how much it has changed.""

The article opens with a story of how Israeli police had to be called to the home of a nuclear physicist to arrest a man who, the Times claimed, had taken the nuclear physics class taught by his daughter. I'll return to the story, but the point is that Israel has a nuclear weapons program and its leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, is a war criminal. The story continues with the tale of US Secretary of State John Kerry, who when asked by Foreign Policy magazine what it would take for Israel to ""end its occupation in the West Bank,"" responded, ""more than anything else.""

Then, the Times claims, aside from this and other stories which prove Israel's continued existence, Israel's ""supremacist"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""has never cut back on his anti-Arab rhetoric,"" and that ""Netanyahu has ignored warnings to the contrary from the Obama administration.""

The Times then begins to hammer home the point that Israel's ""lack of progress toward peace with the Palestinians has made it ever more hard to justify continued support for Mr. Netanyahu, even among his own right-wing coalition members.""

That is, of course, the whole point of the article. The Times is trying to convince the world that Israel's leaders don't care about peace with the Palestinians, that their leaders don't care about the lives of their own citizens, and that to continue supporting Israel, even in the face of its crimes, is to be a complicit member of the Israeli ""normie"" crowd.

Margalit then attempts to make the point that though it now seems as if the Israeli right has been put on notice that they cannot ignore the Palestinians, Israel's leaders are actually emboldened by Israel's recent diplomatic successes.

""But the fact that the Israeli right has been forced to acknowledge the reality of the occupation is not a victory,"" Mr. Margalit writes. ""It is a sign that Israeli society is having a changing of the guard, that the old guard has been replaced by a new generation of Israeli leaders who have never been forced to confront the occupation or the Holocaust.""

Margalit then concludes by describing the new generation of Israeli leaders as ""ethnocentric"" and ""anti-Muslim.""

This is yet another example of the Israeli ""normies"" and"
"As I wrote last month, the last five years have seen a massive surge in the use and deployment of social media. In the United States alone, social networking services—including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Instagram—are now used by more than 300 million people per day. They've become staples in everyday life. And yet it remains unclear how well these services really are used to improve the quality of life. A study released in September by the McKinsey & Company think tank found that users are very reluctant to share their thoughts, feelings, and wishes on social media. Their responses were largely a reflection of what we've all seen before: the media, in this case, being used to advertise products and services.

The authors were particularly impressed with the number of Twitter users who said they would share their opinions with a friend. They found that while almost two-thirds of the respondents in a 2010 survey acknowledged the value of social media in helping them gain an initial understanding of something, only half could remember a time where they had used it that way. One of the reasons, the researchers suggested, was that many users don't understand when to send what to what audience and how to make them happy to receive it.

These days more companies seem to understand this. But the truth is, many of the best practices are still evolving and are hard to replicate. This past fall, the McKinsey team turned to a series of four studies (one of the largest conducted by any think tank, ever) to understand how social media affects people.

At its most basic level, research shows that we like what we like. ""People feel more comfortable sharing their opinions with friends and family, particularly if they perceive the people they're interacting with to have similar perspectives,"" says David L. Hough of the Oxford Internet Institute, who participated in the surveys. ""People like to interact with people they like, so sharing a certain viewpoint with these people feels safer than sharing a different viewpoint with a stranger who has a different worldview."" In other words, like a human conversation, we like to be heard.

""A great way to understand attitudes that might be uncomfortable to you or others is to have people observe how others are interacting online,"" explains Hough. ""If other people behave consistently with their own online behavior, you would see a pretty consistent pattern to things like their opinions on politics, religion, or other societal issues.""

The studies also revealed a few things that some are already doing better than others. For example, the study suggests that people feel less likely to be judged when engaging with an online community if they feel it fosters empathy, rather than just tolerance. Some of the most surprising findings are when considering the type of groups these platforms help people join more broadly, like professional associations or religious organizations.

The results from the four studies are interesting, to say the least, given the size of the companies involved. For that reason alone"
"Statement: The New York Times, in its annual ""Best of the Year"" issue, will be publishing a series of articles, each about a different country, in response to its Open Doors report, which assesses the human rights record of 155 countries around the world. The series, which will appear in the magazine's May issue, will focus on countries with histories of oppression, oppression of women, and human rights abuses.

The series will feature stories from countries such as Burma, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China, and Iran, among others. The series is being co-sponsored by the Times and the Gerald R. Ford Foundation.

The Times believes that stories about the rights of women, gays, and lesbians, people with disabilities, soldiers and their families, and people of different ethnicities and religions deserve broader, more inclusive coverage, and that the series will allow us to bring those stories to a wider audience than we can today.

The series will be an opportunity to follow the work of the Open Doors project, which has been helping to increase the international recognition and protection of human rights since its inception in 2000. Open Doors has published a series of reports on countries that have subpar human rights records, and has been working to raise awareness about the human rights issues of those countries.

The Times has been criticized for its coverage of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar, although we do not advocate for any particular side in the conflict. That said, we have been particularly interested in the role of the military and the role of Myanmar's government in the Rohingya crisis.

The series will be co-sponsored by the Times, the Gerald R. Ford Foundation, and the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The annual run of the world's largest hunter-gatherer society is drawing to a close. A few thousand hunter-gatherers in the Alaska Yukon Territory are wrapping up the work of the first winter after the last hunter-gatherers left their territory, and their traditional way of life is set to change for good.

In this year's effort, the Yukon government has used a strategy that amounts to stocking the last of the last of the food.

""We're not giving up. We're not going anywhere,"" said Tim Everson, a former Yukon governor and now a member of the Yukon legislature. ""We're not going to let them take away our hunting and gathering.""

The Yukon government has used a strategy that amounts to stocking the last of the last of the food.

Everson says the Yukon is ""running out of time."" He says that there are other groups in the area who are working to preserve their way of life and are not ready to give up.

The Yukon government has been trying to get its Yukon Hunter-Gatherers to be more self-sufficient in food, while also taking steps to protect them from predators and increase their food security.

The Yukon government has been trying to get its Yukon Hunter-Gatherers to be more self-sufficient in food, while also taking steps to protect them from predators and increase their food security.

A new government website has been put online to help the hunters and gatherers learn about how they can be more self-sufficient.

The group is shooting and trapping for the first time this year to prepare for the winter. At first, the hunters were hesitant, but now they're ready to go.

""We don't want to go out there and be a couple of weeks behind,"" said Bob Jorgensen, a member of the delegation. ""We want to go out there and prepare for the winter and be ready to hunt.""

The hunters are mostly from the community of Norquay, but they have also included some from other communities.

The Canadian government has also offered to help the Yukon government with the transition to a food supply.

"A jet fighter named Afterburner from the United States Air Force. (Image source: Wikipedia)

The US Air Force has announced that it has successfully tested the first ever solid-fueled jet engine, which is then being tested on a ship.

Although the engine was powered by jet fuel, it was also able to burn solid fuel and has achieved a thrust of 3.7mN, which is more than twice the power of a standard jet.

The test took place in the Mojave Desert in California, where the jet was tested for more than a week. The solid-fueled engine was powered by a mixture of it and liquid oxygen.

It was a single-stage solid-fueled engine that was developed by the US Air Force Research Laboratory, which is based in the California Institute of Technology.

In a statement released by the US Air Force, the research laboratory explained the engine had been designed to operate in on-demand mode and maximise the efficiency of the engines.

The statement said: ""In-demand mode allows the jet engines to perform at their peak power levels on demand. The engine operates in a closed cycle, so it is not dependent on fuel flow.

""The engine can be operated as a single-stage engine or in a multi-stage configuration. In a single-stage configuration, the engine provides power at its maximum power level when an engine restriction is in place. In a multi-stage configuration, the engine provides power to the aircraft at the lowest power level when an engine restriction is in place.""

The breakthrough is not the first time that solid-fueled engines have been developed. Earlier this year, the US Air Force successfully used the engine to power a helicopter, making it the first time that a helicopter has been powered by a solid fuel engine.

The development of solid-fueled engines has been rolled out mainly on lighter aircraft such as the F-35 fighter, which is also powered by solid fuel.

Solid fuel engines are considered far more energy-efficient than jet engines, which require more fuel to run. These engines can also burn solid fuel for less energy, although this is not always the case with jet engines.

Earlier this year, Lockheed Martin announced that it had successfully tested the first solid-fueled engine in the US, which was powered by liquid oxygen. The company said that this technology could be used for future aircraft designs."
"Former CIA officer turned whistleblower John Kiriakou has been released from prison. His girlfriend, a former FBI agent, has been granted a new marriage license.

Kiriakou was sentenced to 30 months in prison in January for disclosing classified information to journalist Chris Hedges.

SPONSORED

In an interview with the Christian Science Monitor, Kiriakou said he was ""grateful"" to be released but ""troubled"" by the conditions of his release.

""The conditions of my confinement are terrible and I'm sorry to be outside of the prison,"" Kiriakou told the Monitor. ""I'm grateful to be free, but I'm troubled by the conditions of my release.""

He described the conditions as ""a kind of monopoly on information.""

""I don't have access to newspapers, magazines or television, but I can get my news from other sources,"" Kiriakou said.

Kiriakou and Hedges were working together on a book about the CIA's use of torture during the Bush administration. They were preparing for a New York Times article that would expose the program.

The book was never published.

Kiriakou's book was published by CounterPunch and originally titled ""The Reluctant Spy: My Secret Life as a CIA Assassin.""

""I was a CIA assassin. I was part of the team that carried out the lethal operations that killed thousands of people in the name of the United States government,"" Kiriakou said at the time.

""I'm sorry for the fact that my life has been turned upside down by the justice system,"" Kiriakou said. ""It's been a long process and I'm grateful for the support of my family and friends.""

When he was sentenced, Kiriakou said he was ""particularly frustrated"" and ""hopeful"" that the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn his conviction.

""This case should have never been brought to this court,"" Kiriakou said. ""There is no justice in the system of justice.""

Kiriakou's sentencing was the first time in the country's history that a CIA officer was jailed for revealing classified information to the media.

""I apologize to all of you for the pain and suffering I have caused. I am deeply sorry for the embarrassment and distress I have caused you,"" Kiriakou said at the time.

In a blog post on Monday, Kiriakou said he is ""grateful"" for his freedom.

""I'm free,"" Kiriakou wrote. ""I'm free to continue my life, my work, my life, in the privacy of my home, where no one will ever be able to find me. I'm free to write, to speak, to teach, to counsel, to think, to pray, and to try to do right by my country.""

"What you need to know about North Korea

North Korea is an authoritarian, militaristic state known for its nuclear weapons, its oppressive rule and its repeated missile tests and, until the recent US airstrikes, its sole source of foreign currency. In the wake of a brutal coup launched by Kim Jong Un last Pyongyang threatened to turn its missile program into a nuclear-tipped ""tipped"" nuclear warhead capable of hitting the US mainland.

However, North Korean leaders are also savvy businessmen and their leaders know they can't just sit idly and wait out a US attack and continue to rely on a shaky regime of trade that helps them pay an army of soldiers. Instead, their plan is to increase the pace of their nuclear tests and then use that to turn nuclear war into a financial windfall; the way it's turned out before.

Now they're making their biggest gamble yet — starting in April with a new long-range rocket it wants to launch that it's said would carry a ton of ""super heavy"" nuclear payload — to finally develop their capability to use nuclear weapons.

North Korea and international sanctions have made it harder for their economy to make money, but their leaders can't abandon their nuclear efforts, so they're trying to make up that loss using the money they gained from illicit trade with South Koreans in recent years. And with that, Pyongyang plans on restarting long-stalled industrial facilities, expanding and modernizing the country's missile program and conducting its fifth nuclear test.

North Korea says that they're aiming for an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US — in effect, the exact missile they've been trying to develop with their nuclear arsenal — and the next stage of their plans were revealed by Kim Jong Un during a visit to Beijing Tuesday. It was the first time Kim has publicly presented such a detailed plan for North Korea's nuclear weapons program since the last nuclear test last December.

""The test will enable the country to confirm if we have completed making [our ballistic rockets] capable of inter-continental ballistic missile,"" Kim said at the signing of a joint venture between a Chinese firm and the North's third nuclear research center, which was approved by China, according to the AP.

So, they plan to add two new ICBMs to their arsenal, and then launch them in the spring. The plan, based on the successful testing of a Taepodong 2 submarine capable of carrying a nuclear payload in the spring of 2014, is to launch the missile during the first week of the new year, then keep it in flight for a month with one of them at least capable of reaching the US mainland.

But here is the thing — they can't make the money because most of their trade with South Korea has halted in recent years. So they will have to use the money to pay off the soldiers keeping them in power — something that will be easier said than done as their soldiers are"

The man charged with killing former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson has been denied bond as the victim's family members, and the victims' teammates across the NFL, continue to call for his release. He will remain in prison, unable to see his two young children, for the time being.

Duerson, 42, was shot three times early Sunday morning in his home in the South Chicago neighborhood.

""It takes a village to raise a child,"" Bears legend George Halas said Sunday, speaking not only on the killing of Duerson but on the need for more safety in the home. ""It takes a village to care for an injured player … and I've been through hell and back as far as losing friends to injuries and stuff like that, but to hear about someone who's been in your shoes and you're doing their family some justice, that's a huge thing.""

Cincinnati Bengals safety Shawn Williams, who will join Halas at Halas Hall on Sunday, has long fought for Duerson's release.

""It's very important to our people, whether you're talking about the team or whether you're talking about a fan base, we have to have more understanding for what the guys go through every day,"" Williams said. ""So, obviously, the people that know about the game that do the work that are on TV and that are on a position coach's radar and those kinds of things, they need to do more talking and they need to really do some of the work on these guys and the family members and just the community to see that the guys are there for us.""

Duerson signed a one-day contract with the Bears in March 2011 and made a total of 12 appearances in the NFL.

""For my son I hope that I can go to the Super Bowl and be with him, no matter how long it takes,"" Halas told ESPN on Sunday. ""I was sitting there, watching this kid for the last 11 weeks, his time with the Bears and the family, and to hear this news is just like a nightmare. I just hope that this is not his last time playing football.""

Duerson led the NFL with three interceptions in his only season with the Bears, and led the league with four interceptions with the Bengals from 2007-11.

The former fourth-round pick of the Panthers, Duerson is best known as a part of the 2008 Bears' Super Bowl run, a run that ended in the NFC Championship Game.

""It's very tough,"" Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher said about the news of Duerson's death. ""He was such a great player. He was on the field every day and he was a great teammate. To hear about it and not even know and just feel some type of way it's just hard to fathom.""

Chicago Bears owner Jerry White did not comment on Duerson on Saturday. According to a source"

A former student has told how they got drunk, had sex in a church and ate pizza during one trip to a gay'summer camp'.

Jessica, 19, said they were part of a group of friends who had sex with men on a trip to a gay'summer camp' in the Philippines.

The students, from Cambridge, were drunk and 'in a drunken state' when they met up with another group of friends, who filmed the incident and posted the videos on a gay forum.

Jessica and her friends went to the camp in February last year having heard about it through a friend.

(Image: Google Earth)

Speaking when she told of her harrowing ordeal, she said: ""You got so drunk with each other – just so wasted.""

At 7pm they met up with another group who joined them for a drink.

While drinking they went to sleep in a tent and awoke in the morning, after they had had sex with six men.

Jessica said they were part of a group that had sex with men and drank alcohol and took drugs including drugs found in gay'summer camp' porn.

(Image: Facebook)

She added: ""We thought we were in a gay camp.

""I was thinking, 'This is just a summer camp', but when you're drunk and you're stupid you think otherwise.""

Jessica said they had eaten pizza, then had sex with men in church, a forest and in a room.

She said: ""We thought, 'This is too good, I want to try and get into the gay camp'.""

They were arrested by an official after the video was posted on the gaysexforum.com.

But Jessica and her friends were later released and returned to their homes in Cambridge.

(Image: Facebook)

But she decided not to report the matter to police as all of them drank the same time on the trip and she did not want to be a 'liar'.

She said: ""It's not like I felt any kind of guilt that I did or I felt like anyone saw or knew I was doing it, it was just me doing stupid things and I didn't want to make them know about what I had done.""

She said they were all drunk and'very stupid'.

Jessica also said the trip to the camp was filmed by a group of the same group who were part of her English Literature course at the university.

She said: ""They were my friends and we were all in the same subject.

""They filmed us going round to their friend's house and they were watching it.""

"The rate of new cases of cancer in the United States has been increasing in recent years. This is because of a combination of things, including a rise in the number of people living longer and a decrease in smoking.

But a new study suggests that it could be something more basic to your diet that's contributing to the increase in cancer.

Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, and the University of Colorado, Boulder, looked at the diets of 2,313 people in the United States between the years 2000 and 2012.

They found that people who consumed the most red and processed meat had an 81 percent higher risk for developing cancer, compared to those who ate the least.

""So, the more red meat you eat, the higher your risk for developing cancer,"" study researcher Yifat Gottlieb, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF, told Live Science.

The study authors pointed out that the findings may not apply to people who eat a standard American diet, as red meat contains fiber, which is beneficial to the body.

They also said it may be that people who eat a lot of processed meat are more likely to smoke, something that could increase the risk of cancer.

The National Cancer Institute recommends that men who eat the most red meat and women who eat the most processed meat cut back on both. However, it's unclear whether red meat is the cause or the effect of cancer, the institute said.

""Red meat contains high amounts of nutrients; however, processed meat is also a source of saturated and trans fats that increase your risk for cancer, heart disease, and stroke,"" the National Cancer Institute said in a statement. ""Eating too much red meat leads to high blood cholesterol, which increases your risk for heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers.""

The study was published online on May 18 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.

"The question of who the best quarterback in the NFL is is a difficult one to answer. There are too many variables to measure to make any sort of meaningful conclusion. There are a multitude of different factors that can be taken into consideration, including tendencies, talent, ability to make plays, and ability to adapt to the NFL game.

With that being said, it's still smart to take a look at the top quarterbacks in the league. While the league has changed dramatically over the past few years (with offenses increasingly becoming more spread and the NFL's emphasis on the run), the elite signal callers have mostly stayed the same.

So, who are the best quarterbacks in the NFL?

"The New Orleans Pelicans are not afraid to start rookie Davis, and they are willing to take the chance.

Last season, the Pelicans made the decision to start Anthony Davis in place of DeMarcus Cousins. By the end of the season, both Cousins and Davis were in the first four for All-Star games—a feat not accomplished a single time in NBA history, as far back as the 1967-1968 season.

Davis was in the beginning for the Pelicans. He was supposed to be the next big thing with the Pelicans, so his performance was often overlooked for more-hyped veterans.

This season, though, Davis is still the only one playing time. He has started 12 straight games, and his play has only become more impressive with every outing. The next two games look like a must-win situation for the Pelicans and Davis could be the key.

New Orleans lost to the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday. This loss was a complete blow.

Even though Davis was only in a small role, the New Orleans Pelicans came out flat at one point in the game and their lead ballooned in the third quarter. While Davis was not the reason why the Pelicans ended up losing, the rookie is not going to be the reason why the Pelicans will win. His play is starting to shine.

In the third quarter, Pelicans started running plays for Davis, and with three first half three-pointers and an alley-oop for a layup, he went into the game with his team leading 84-68. After a short break in play, the Pelicans played the rest of the third quarter without Davis. They went back to him after the team started playing out of their minds for the first time in the game.

Davis led the Pelicans with 12 points on 4-of-7 shooting and 1-of-3 from three. The rest of the players played solid defense, but Davis had a few big buckets against Portland's smaller team to help turn a close race.

Davis played an almost unguardable game against Portland. He dominated in the post, got to the rim, and finished at the rim with a career high 31 points. He was very effective with his post game against the small defensive scheme of the Trail Blazers.

His shot is already impressive and with his ability to get to the lane, he could add a lot more points to his game. This has been his game for a long time.

Forwards Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon also continued with their strong starts, as they are still two of the better players on the team. Davis and Anderson have the potential to score with more efficiency.

Dante Cunningham is in an interesting place at the middle of the floor. When the Pelicans are on offense, he can guard bigger guards and forwards because he can shoot the ball effectively from the wing. In the second half, he started coming off the bench to get more of an opportunity"
"""The Dark Knight Rises"" tells a story about the rise of vigilantism in Gotham City. A crime wave erupts after the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, but the film isn't just about the police and Batman getting in the way of the criminals. The film shows little-known situations that are already being discussed, and it's a way for Nolan to follow up on some of the themes and ideas that have been established in previous films.

One of these is the idea of a ""gray zone,"" a place where people can be judged without being punished. In ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" one of the most memorable scenes involves a Bowery drug dealer, who is being held up by a SWAT team, who starts to plead and beg for his life. He says, ""I didn't do it. I didn't do it."" The cop makes a joke about how he didn't really do anything when he was shot, and the dealer responds, ""I didn't do it."" The scene continues as the dealer gets shot. He's still talking, still begging, still pleading, but no one takes him seriously.

That scene is a clear ode to the civil rights movement. It shows that there are areas where people can be judged without being punished for their actions. The police in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" are the police, but they're also the ones who are supposed to be protecting the public. And that's a great thing. It shows that the police are not the enemy, but the people who are doing what they're doing.

You have to remember that the Batman franchise has always been about a small group of people, in a city, who are fighting to be the dominant force. The first movie was about two guys fighting for the rights to their child. The second movie was about two people fighting for the rights to their child. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" shows that there are people who are doing the same thing, who are fighting to be the dominant force in their city, and they're not being stopped.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a great American movie, but it's also a great American story. It shows that the people who are doing the right thing are not always the ones who are being given the benefit of the doubt, and it shows that good can triumph over evil.

"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel on Wednesday said it had intercepted a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, killing three people in the southern city of Beersheba in an incident that also wounded two people.

The Palestinian death toll in the conflict, the eighth in six weeks, rose to at least 322, medical officials said. More than 8,000 Palestinians have been wounded, some of them seriously.

""We have struck a rocket that was fired from the Gaza Strip,"" Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon said in a statement. ""Three people have been killed and two others have been injured.""

He said the army had targeted a home where militants were planning to launch rockets.

""In the course of this operation, we also damaged a military complex belonging to Hamas,"" Yaalon said.

He said the army had also clashed with militants in the city of Khan Yunis after an army jeep was hit by a rocket that was fired from the Strip. No casualties were immediately reported.

The Israeli military said it was not clear if the targeting of the home was the result of a mistake.

The Palestinian health ministry said Palestinians suffered from several injuries, many of them from shrapnel and rubber pellets after a rocket fired from Gaza hit the town of Sderot.

The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that Israeli forces had clashed with Palestinian militants in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip, where they ""mistakenly"" fired on soldiers.

""The incident was immediately brought under control and the soldiers were given the all-clear,"" the statement said.

Rocket salvoes from Gaza have been increasingly frequent in recent days. On Monday, a mortar attack in southern Israel killed an Israeli Arab, a security source said.

Israeli officials said a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip was intercepted over the city of Ashkelon, a Hamas stronghold, in what the military said was another successful interception."

This week it is ""trending"" that women in the United States can now legally be fired for being raped. But the truth is that many of these fired women actually were not actually raped. Instead, these women were fired for refusing to be raped.


In California, the California legislature has passed a bill that defines a rape victim as someone who was ""compelled to submit to sexual intercourse or to a sexual act by physical force or violence or by threats of force or violence."" This is a radical redefinition of rape, because it redefines the crime to apply to those who physically force you to have sex with them, not rape victims who are afraid of their attacker.


That means that women who are raped are not victims of ""sexual violence"" anymore. They are victims of being threatened with being raped if they don't comply with their rapist's demand to have sex with them.


There is nothing wrong or improper about not wanting to have sex with a criminal who demands it. It shouldn't matter if the woman is scared of being raped by her rapist, or if the woman is scared of getting raped herself because her rapist has threatened to do things like put a needle into her arm. But that is what California seems to be telling women as its law now defines ""rape.""

In Illinois, the Illinois legislature has passed a bill ""which requires that criminal defendants who are found guilty of a crime that includes sexual assault upon an under-aged victim 'injury' or'serious physical injury' to victims. In addition, as noted in the bill, sexual assault may include'sexual contact' including the intentional touching on the sexual or intimate parts of the victim that is 'incriminating or offensive.' The bill also says the crime must cause'serious and lasting harm"" as defined by the state's criminal code.


This bill is dangerous because it seems to be making sexual assault a crime against those who do not want it, but who are forced into it by criminals. This is exactly the situation victims of actual rape often find themselves in.

In Maine, the Maine House of Representatives has passed a bill allowing the firing of women who experience physical attacks or threats of physical harassment. The Maine governor is now now required to sign off on such a bill.

In New Jersey, the New Jersey legislature has passed a bill that would make women who experience or witness physical attacks against them lose their jobs if they do not submit to physical attacks on them. The New Jersey governor is now required to sign off on such a bill.

Last year, New Hampshire was the first state to pass a ""sexual harassment"" law; this month, Pennsylvania was the last state to pass such a law. This raises some serious moral quandaries about whether we are prepared to treat women as human beings or as sexual objects by simply forcing them to allow criminals to violate them physically.

Sadly, many states are passing so-"

"A 50-year-old woman who was detained by immigration authorities earlier this month has been released and released on bond, according to her attorney.

Kiryakos Martinez, who was brought to the U.S. when she was 5, was allowed to leave her Paso Del Norte, Calif., jail on Wednesday. Her attorney, Brett Melville, said she is over the legal limit for being detained and therefore her release was legal. She had been detained for nearly a week.

Melville said his client will be back in the U.S. on Thursday.

The incident arose after Martinez violated a judge's order to report to immigration authorities in Southern California to serve an 86-day jail sentence at a federal detention center in Florence, Ariz. She has been in custody since Feb. 17.

Martinez, who has lived in the U.S. for more than 20 years and holds a green card, had been ordered to report to prison on Feb. 27 but failed to do so, according to Melville. She was detained by U.S. Border Patrol on Feb. 25.

Martinez's lawyer said she was released on bond Thursday, and that Martinez, who has no criminal record, should be allowed to return to her home in California.

""Kiryakos was released on bond because she has no criminal record, and she was not in jail on any charges related to this case,"" Melville said.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said Martinez is a mother of two young children who was being detained for violating immigration law.

ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice said Martinez was released because of her prior good conduct while in custody. She said her release was not related to her being a victim of domestic violence, but rather her failure to comply with ICE detention orders.

Melville said his client has no criminal record and has an endorsement from the federal government to be released on bond.

""She was arrested for a misdemeanor,"" Melville said. ""She's currently being held in a federal facility in Florence and her bond was set at $1,000 to be released Feb. 27th.""

He said Martinez is not a flight risk and there was no evidence that she intended to flee the country after her release.

Melville said Martinez will return to California on Friday and intends to apply for a green card.

""She will be back in California on Thursday and then will apply for a green card,"" he said. ""She won't be going to Mexico or anywhere else. She is going to apply for a green card in California.""

""She is a very good mother,"" he said. ""She has two young children. She has been in the U.S. for over 20 years. She has been working and paying taxes. She is a very good mom, and she has been helping"

We've seen it in real-time for years -- there are some pretty great animated gifs and animations that we get to enjoy in our browsers. This is a really nice way to celebrate kids or people in places that we don't normally see them.

Let's say you go to a party and you realize that you don't know how to dance. You've never danced in your life, so your friends are very happy to introduce you to the most popular dances in their neighborhood: salsa, bachata, salsa craze, salsa boom. You are a good dancer, but you don't know how to dance in salsa. You try to try and copy each dance, but you can't really match the pace or the technique of the other dances. So you sit back for a few minutes and you notice the dancing. There's a new trend among people and they're not sure how to dance, but they're having enough fun that they'll just keep dancing.

Now let's say you go to the internet. You look at Google Images and you see a bunch of web images. The majority of the images are of people waving at you. There's one, maybe a dozen. One of the images is a really long, slow, graceful sweeping movement. When you click on it, you see that it's actually moving and there's other pictures of people waving to you in different ways. You check them out. There are a few that are really good, but most are just okay. So you find one or two that are really good. They aren't terribly different from each other.

On some of these images, the waving animation seems good enough -- the animations are smooth and the pictures look as if they are moving. But those images don't really represent human motion. You can't see how they move their arms or how their hands are moving. You won't know how or why they're waving to you, and you probably wouldn't recognize any of them if they were standing next to you. These pictures are really just drawings.

As you'll get to know your browser's gestures library for the web, it's clear that people are designing web apps that need a lot more than just animations to represent human motion. The Web Animations"

"The debate over whether or not to use a ""net neutrality"" rule to block paid-prioritization by ISPs has been going on for decades. The issue has become even more interesting this year, as the FCC's current chairman is openly supporting the idea.

In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has openly called for the agency to go down the path of ""strong"" net neutrality rules.

""I believe that strong rules are the right way to go,"" Wheeler said. ""I'm a big believer in the Title II [of the Communications Act], which still remains the right tool to address these problems.""

Wheeler is right, the FCC should have strong net neutrality rules. And it's a good thing he's aware of the history of the issue.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the FCC was accused of violating net neutrality rules for allowing paid prioritization in the phone system.

At the time, Verizon was the most dominant provider of phone service in the country. The company wanted to offer phone service to customers at higher speeds than competitors did.

To do this, Verizon would have needed the ability to block data from its competitors, which it had the ability to do.

In a 1979 case, the FCC ruled that Verizon could not block data from competing phone companies.

The FCC said that Verizon could not block ""deliveries of basic services."" This meant that Verizon could not slow down, or otherwise interfere with, the service of other companies.

The FCC also said that Verizon could not use its network to discriminate between different types of data.

In the 1990s, the FCC changed its rules to allow for the use of data caps in the phone system. At the time, many of the phone companies with larger data caps (AT&T, Verizon, and BellSouth) were the largest competitors of Verizon.

This led to a lot of public outcry, and prompted the FCC to re-write the rules to allow for the use of data caps. This time, the FCC prohibited phone companies from using network management to favor certain kinds of data over others.

In the years that followed, the FCC started to get complaints about phone companies using data caps to slow down their competitors.

In 1994, a group of senators (led by then-Senator Al Gore) introduced a bill to ban the use of data caps by phone companies.

The bill died in committee. But the FCC did ""bring the subject up"" in the 2000 election, when then-Senator Mike Dukakis was running for president.

Dukakis, and his then-chief of staff Rob Nabors, sent an open letter to the FCC, asking for a moratorium on data caps. The FCC eventually agreed on a temporary moratorium.

This moratorium ushered in a period of stricter net neutrality rules, starting in 2002. They lasted"
"SALEM, Ore. -- A Portland man in his late 60s who was convicted of child abuse in 2010 faces new charges after the Oregon Liquor Control Commission uncovered evidence he also sexually abused an adult relative.

Richard Pfefferkorn told the Oregonian on Wednesday he was the owner of a business that sold adult videos, but he would not say who his client was.

The LCC said Pfefferkorn has a license to operate a adult video store at 2726 SE Stark St. in the West End. He was taken into custody on Friday and was charged Friday.

State law says that anyone who manufactures, sells or transports child pornography could be prosecuted for child abuse. Anyone who sexually abuses a child could face more than 1,000 years in prison, the state says, but that only applies to a child who's 13 or younger.

The state liquor commission said Wednesday it found a DVD box labeled ""Puff and Puff 2,"" but it did not say if that was where the abuse went on.

Pfefferkorn told the Oregonian on Sunday, ""I never touched her,"" and said he didn't know about the video production until he was arrested. He said he thought it was a mistake that the video production company he has worked for since 1976 had an employee with a child pornography conviction.

The commission said it sent Pfefferkorn's address to the FBI, and it sent in a request for an investigation, but officials would not go into specifics.

Pfefferkorn's defense attorney, John M. Horsley, said he wanted to speak with Pfefferkorn only in person.

""I'm hoping to meet with him on the phone or to pick him up,"" Horsley said Thursday. ""At this point I'm not certain the charges will be dropped.""

Horsley said the investigation had revealed that an adult male relative was sexually abused at the same address Pfefferkorn owns. When the abuse occurred, Horsley said, Huppermann told his client it was his fault and that they moved from the address within the last year.

Hippie Joe's Lounge was located at the same address on SE Stark Street. Pfefferkorn was charged last Tuesday.

Special forces are highly effective in urban combat or a large-scale hostage rescue operation, while elite Marines and a limited number of soldiers are often needed to mount the rescue.

U.S. and Turkish security officials in Ankara, with the approval of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, are discussing whether ""a high-end commando type"" team of special forces could be used for the mission, according to one former U.S. official.

The Obama administration has so far resisted any plan to expand the U.S. presence in Iraq.

The officials said it was unclear whether Turkish air power could intervene to aid the Iraqi operation but that U.S. forces could play a role. American and Russian planes are already flying over northern Iraq, and it is unclear what more can be accomplished militarily.

The situation has intensified U.S. concerns that the fight against the Islamic State is going to drag on, in what U.S. officials said was a message that the U.S. is not going to wait for the Iraqi security forces or Kurdish forces to win the effort against the Islamic State.

The U.S. is also wary of Iran stepping in to fill the void left by U.S. casualties, and is increasingly concerned about the growing power and reach of Iran's Shiite militias.

One U.S. official who has seen the current situation in Mosul said it was clear Iraqi forces were being ""fragile,"" but there was no one American option that could make it possible. While acknowledging the difficulty of the current situation, the official said they could not recommend any particular action because it could worsen the situation further.

The situation also highlights the risks of U.S. forces going into Iraq without the permission of the Iraqi government.

The current situation has been complicated by confusion about who is holding the key neighborhoods inside Mosul, and whether Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces loyal to the Kurdistan Regional Government might be allowed to enter the city.

The U.S. has given the Iraqi government no advance notice of any movement into the city, a U.S. defense official acknowledged. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said he was disappointed in what he viewed as a slow and ineffective U.S. response to the situation, which has ""made things worse.""

Kurdish peshmerga troops captured the neighborhood of Al Asir from the Islamic State earlier this week.

""Our Iraqi partners will receive notification and we will coordinate with them to address any security concerns that may necessitate the use of ground forces,"" the Kurdish official said.

The Kurds see the al-Asir neighborhood, which is just south of the airport, as a base of operations for operations,"
"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A man accused of shooting a woman to death at a West Palm Beach apartment complex is accused of threatening to kill her family, police said.

WESTERN CITY POLICE

Nick Podehr, 36, is charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder.

Police said Podehr called 911, saying he shot and killed his ex-girlfriend, a 31-year-old West Palm Beach woman, at the Golden Gate Apartments on Royston Parkway.

""He told the dispatcher that he shot and killed his ex-girlfriend and she was 'not breathing,' and he was holding her head under water,"" said Detective Paul Grubbs with the West Palm Beach Police Homicide Unit.

When police arrived at the scene, they said they found the woman was dead of an apparent gunshot wound.

Detectives said Podehr has a criminal history, including a shooting in June 2015 and a May 2016 domestic battery charge.

""He was very difficult to contact, but we did get him to talk to us,"" Grubbs said. ""He told us that the shooting was justified and that he had been threatened.""

Police said Podehr admitted to shooting his ex-girlfriend and threatened to kill her family.

""He said that she was going to kill his family and that he had to protect himself,"" Grubbs said. ""He said he had to injure her or kill her. He said he was going to kill her if he didn't do what he was told.""

Police said there is no evidence that Podehr's ex-girlfriend had been planning to hurt his family, but police said they are still investigating the incident.

""There is no evidence that she was planning to do anything other than it was a domestic dispute,"" Grubbs said. ""There is no evidence that she had any intention to harm anyone else and no evidence that she was trying to harm the suspect or anyone else.""

Grubbs said Podehr told police he was ""on a mission"" to kill the woman.

""He said that he wanted to kill her. He said that he was going to kill her,"" Grubbs said. ""He said that he was going to kill the children. He said that he was going to kill her and his kids so that's why he shot her.""

Podehr was arrested at the scene and taken to the Palm Beach County Jail. He is being held without bond.

Police said the woman's ex-husband was at the apartment complex at the time of the shooting.

"It's been a little while since I've written anything about the X-Men. So, after having played some games, it was a little time I'm giving myself to make this piece timely and accurate. So, without further adieu, it's time for my definitive breakdown of the X-Men:

The X-Men have been around for almost sixty years and through some of the biggest events and most legendary heroes; they've remained a constant source of entertainment for every American that is a fan of pop culture. And who are we talking about!

The X-Men

The X-Games are an annual event at X Games Sanction, an annual event held by EA, that showcases video games from around the world. The event is held twice a year; once in December for Christmas, and once in July to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of Stan Lee's first appearance in comics in Fantastic Four #15 (July, 1964).

When Stan Lee first created the X-Men, he was inspired by the team from the Marvel comic ""Giants in the Earth's Sky"" as well as a team from the Marvel cartoon ""Giants in the Twister"". This ""Giants"" team consists of: Doctor Doom, Kang the Conqueror & Galactus, Namor the Sub-Mariner, the Silver Surfer, Mystique, & She-Hulk. In ""Giants in the Earth's Sky"", there were more team members as well as some other characters that did not make it to the cartoon, such as Giant Man, The Inhumans, and Captain America. It was a team created to challenge the Avengers and Fantastic Four but instead it proved to be a team that challenged and even surpassed them at times.

This is where X-Games were born; a contest for an all-out war between the X-Men, Fantastic Four & Inhumans. Each team has their own unique game; Fantastic Four has a game which focuses on the origin and background of the team as well as training. In it, you can play as the team and have your player start with the Original Five members, Storm, Colossus, Wolverine, Professor X & Phoenix. While the X-Men has a game focusing on the creation and development of the team, such as the New Mutants and New X-Men. And finally, the X-Men have the most fun game of all as it is a game about combat.

The X-Games

X-Games has a variety of activities for players, including flying stunt and stunt bikes, obstacle courses and skateboarding. They can also run through a obstacle course in the form of a maze and try to reach checkpoints. As well, each team has a special game as well as their own unique style of gameplay. The team in charge of the ""Rivals"" group have an obstacle course game that you can enjoy playing from their group. Another group, titled the """
"If you're a man who has been thinking about becoming a stay-at-home dad, here's some bad news.

It's probably time to think again.

According to research by researchers at the University of Kentucky, being a stay-at-home dad can actually be the last thing you want.

It turns out that dads aren't that great at keeping in touch with their children -- even when they stay home with them.

""When they leave the home as a parent, the father isn't really connected with the kids that much, and what I found was the kids did not like the dads in general,"" said Daniela Jakubowicz of the University of Kentucky in a press statement. ""So even if they are doing a great job with the kids, the mom is not really feeling connected with it.""

Researchers say the reasons dads can struggle in being a stay-at-home father is because they may not want to be with their child for long periods, or because they worry that it will feel 'different' from how parents spend all of their time with their kids.

If that strikes you as odd, you might be surprised to hear more about the research.

Researchers found that dads who weren't very involved with the kids during their first year of home raising tended to go on to become ""dads who stayed home longer and spent more time with their kids.""

But other interesting facts about the research:

There were even dads who seemed to prefer spending the majority of their time doing things that brought them emotional fulfillment.

The study found that the best dads were the ones who found time to be a ""good parent, who is attentive when the kids are young and responsive to their needs as they grow older and as their needs change.""

The study concluded that the best fathers spend ""at least 80 per cent of their time providing emotional support to their children, whether they are their own children or not.""

So there you have it -- stay-at-home dads are bad dads but, if they're lucky, they can find time to be the best dads. Maybe it's time you got comfortable being you.

"A woman has been charged with murder and attempted murder after she allegedly shot her husband in the face in front of their children as they slept in their home in Victoria.

Police were called to a home in the north-west of Victoria at 9.15am on Tuesday after a man's wife woke up to find her husband had been shot in the face.

She allegedly used a shotgun she kept under her pillow to shoot her husband in the face, but was arrested after she ran out of the house and called police.

The man was rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries.

The couple's two children were asleep in the house at the time of the incident, a Victoria Police spokesman said."
"Introduction

The computer industry has been a field dominated by software companies for decades. For the last twenty years, however, the computer industry has seen a shift in the dominance of hardware manufacturers. Since 1998, when Microsoft's Windows operating system became the industry standard, the computing landscape has been dominated by software vendors that focus on the creation and distribution of software, hardware, and other products.

The shift in hardware dominance is the result of two things. One is the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has created a large market for connected devices and services. The other is the rise of mobile computing, which has led to a significant decrease in hardware sales.

In this report, we look at five trends that are driving hardware hardware sales: the rise of mobile computing, an increase in sales of tablet PCs, a shift in the way products are sold, a decline in device productivity, and an increase in the number of connected devices. We also look at the implications for the industry and individual businesses.

We will also look at the impact of the shift to mobile computing on the industry, and make recommendations for companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, who are looking to build new businesses in the new marketplace.

What Are We Looking at?

In this report, we are looking at five trends that are driving hardware sales. The first is the rise of mobile computing. This shift has been building for years, but the explosion of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices has made it the dominant trend in the industry.

The second trend is the increase in sales of tablet PCs. This is primarily driven by the combination of emerging technologies like 3D modeling and virtual reality, as well as the success of companies like Amazon and Samsung, which offer low-cost tablets to consumers.

The third trend is an increase in the number of connected devices. This will be driven by an increase in connected home devices and wearables, such as connected speakers and headphones, as well as the growing number of connected cameras and other sensors.

The fourth trend is the decline in hardware sales. The decline in hardware sales has been the result of several factors, including the rise of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices, a decline in the industry's productivity, and the shift to mobile devices.

The Fifth Trend

As we will see in this report, the shift to mobile computing is having an impact on the industry. In fact, we are observing a rapid change in the way that products are sold. The most obvious change is the shift from desktop to mobile devices. The number of desktop computers in use has dwindled in recent years, while the number of mobile devices has grown dramatically.

This shift is affecting the industry in two ways. First, the distribution of sales. As we can see from our data, there are more tablets being sold than desktops. As a result, the number"

"Don't be alarmed by the fact that I've finally gotten around to writing my review of this book. It was originally scheduled for release last year (I think it was), but I have been so busy with work and other things that I was unable to get it out until now.


I think that the reason why this book took so long to get out is that I was afraid that it would be an obvious ripoff of a book I read years ago. That has not been the case! The story is completely original, and I really liked it.


The main character is Monica, a woman who was born with a genetic disorder called ""Parasitical Abnormalities"", and has been in a wheelchair since she was a baby. Monica's father has been constantly working, and now has a very abusive wife. Monica's mother died when Monica was just a baby, and her father has been completely neglectful and cruel to Monica since then.


Monica spends her days trying to get out of her wheelchair, and the first half of the book is devoted to her doing so. However, the story quickly turns into a tale of what it is like to be Monica, and how she deals with her father's abuse. The story basically revolves around Monica being abused by her father, and getting in his way a lot.


The thing that I think makes this book unique is that it is told through the eyes of Monica. In other books, Monica's experiences are told by a narrator, who is usually the author. However, this book is told entirely through Monica's eyes, and I really enjoyed it. Monica's memories and feelings are vivid, and I was always able to relate to her. I also really enjoyed the fact that Monica's father and mother knew about Monica's condition, but did not try to help her.


The book is very good at getting its point across, and does this in a very unique way. However, as I said before, the story does not end in a happy way. The story is about a lot of emotional and physical pain, but overall I think it was a very well written book. I enjoyed reading it as much as I did reading the original book.


I am going to give this book a 4/5 because it is still very much in the early stages of development. The author has a couple of other books up, and I am very interested in what they have to offer, so I do not want to go into the plot too much yet. Also, Monica's disability is very real and present in the story, but I think that this is a little harder to deal with than the disability of a character in a novel that is told entirely through the eyes of that character. There are a few things that Monica cannot do, and I was not a fan of how she was portrayed in this book. The book does not give me as much information about Monica's condition as the"
"The video for the ""Gentlemen"" track from FKA twigs' debut album 'Pure Heroine' was released yesterday and features the following:

The video has now been removed, after the track's producer, Matt Helders, took to social media to discuss the incident. Here's his explanation for why it was removed and what went wrong:

""It was a video I shot of a girl being attacked. I have never seen the video. It was released by a very powerful person who used it to bully me and other female artists. I have been informed by these same people for some time that we should not post videos online or social media. They have said that they do this because it gives people the impression that women aren't safe. If you post a video of anyone being attacked without proof of the event happening or an eyewitness statement, then you are attacking their character. I took a screen grab of the video, because they had just put it up for us:

Then, after they noticed that I took their video down, they put up their own version of the clip. After they saw that I kept taking their video down, they put the video up again.

Then my manager reached out to them and said they had removed their own video so that I would not post it online. They then changed their story and said that I had not put the video up before I was notified because they were scared.

They then said that since they had changed their story and were threatening to sue me, and were worried about how they were going to sue me, that I should not put the footage up on the internet and also removed it. I complied and took the video down.

After they put it up again, it was sent to the editor who wrote an article. I was asked about it and I explained that there was a new version of the video but I had taken it down as before. After they reviewed it, they told me the video is up now.

I have no idea what their intentions were. They were extremely threatening. Now they say I have been threatening people and put it up so I cannot use it. I have every right to do what I have done.

My manager had contacted them several times and asked them to contact me but they never did. I am still getting a few messages from them.""

"Intelligence from the US House Intelligence Committee has concluded that President Vladimir Putin directed a hacking campaign aimed at undermining confidence in the US democratic process.

The committee's report, which was released in its entirety to BuzzFeed News, attacks the Russian government for a campaign that it said was intended to help elect Donald Trump. It also faults the Democratic Party for not doing enough to prevent the hacks and the press for making the issue a partisan one.

But few of the most striking findings of the 696-page report are about Russia. Instead, they focus on the actions of other parties, most notably Hillary Clinton's campaign, and the US government's response to them.

The report asserts that Russian interference had three goals: undermine faith in the US electoral process; discredit Secretary of State Clinton; and harm US interests. Some of the report's sections are heavily redacted.

One of the most damning sections is titled ""Russian Active Measures Campaign: Attribution,"" and is the most exposed section of the report. The section's findings include:

Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process; denigrate Secretary Clinton; harm her electability and potential presidency; and harm US interests through the release of information stolen from the Democratic National Committee and others.

The report also found that Russia's interference was especially aimed at swaying the election toward Trump, who has consistently praised Putin, and that the US government had been aware of the hacks for months.

""Russia's goals are not hidden. They are openly discussed by the Russian government,"" the report said. ""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.""

The report also found that the Russian government exploited social media to collect information on voters in key swing states, and used bots to amplify propaganda on Twitter. It also found that Russian officials contacted US election officials during the campaign and sought to influence the outcome.

Those conclusions are supported by an FBI official who testified to the committee:

""The Russian active measures campaign reached the highest levels of the Russian government,"" said Andrew McCabe, deputy director of the FBI. ""The Russian government is trying to break through the cyber-defenses of our country.""

The report also describes a series of ""cyber-theft"" incidents involving US systems in which the hackers stole large amounts of data. Some of those incidents appear to have been carried out by Russia-based hackers, including two cases in which Russian-speaking hackers penetrated the networks of the US Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Personnel Management.

The report also said that Russian state-sponsored trolls sought to spread misinformation about the election on social media, and that Russia ""influenced a US Presidential election through a sophisticated information operations campaign.""

"A federal judge threw out a lawsuit on Monday that alleged that the Chicago Fire Department is denying life support to those in their last hours of life, saying the lawsuit was premature, potentially causing further harm among those who are already terminally ill, and could violate a federal prohibition on wrongful death and torture.

U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman wrote in her ruling that the lawsuit, brought last year by the American Civil Liberties Union, was filed ""without sufficient facts, speculation and speculation.""

The ACLU has been suing the city and the Fire Department for years over its practices, but the suit, filed in late 2011 in U.S. District Court, was dismissed in December. At the time, the Chicago Fire Department said it was responding to an outpouring of support to help those being denied care ""in a respectful and respectful way."" City officials said at the time that it was the largest public health care response in the nation since 1986.

In her ruling Monday, Coleman said that although the group had provided ""credible information"" about the extent of the problem, the ""unfortunate truth of these facts is that many more people will die unnecessarily in our city as a result of the current lack of adequate emergency medical services, and the public has not been adequately warned of the dangerous repercussions.""

The lawsuit had alleged in part that the city's policy to limit resuscitation use during last-resort emergency situations ""causes unnecessary suffering or death.""

""There is no evidence that life-sustaining resuscitation services are denied to anyone — at anytime — who is in need of such services,"" Coleman said. ""Nor is there evidence that resuscitation services are denied when there is time left in the patients' lives, but that time is not used to provide the very critical care that the plaintiffs seek to obtain.""

The policy, she said, ""creates the appearance of a policy and practice that is discriminatory on the basis of race.""

The suit, which was brought at the behest of the hospital group Health Alliance of Illinois, identified more than 6,000 people who were said to have died since 2004 because of a lack of resuscitation — roughly 30 percent of all such deaths in the five-county area.

According to Health Alliance of Illinois, the city has denied the use of resuscitation in a median of 7.7 minutes after the arrival of a critical incident in which a patient was deemed to be dying. In more than half of those cases, the suit said the patients had not suffered significant brain damage and were not in need of a ventilator, which is the main intervention.

The suit further alleged that people placed in life-support beds ""suffered neglect,"" including ""neglectful monitoring"" by hospital workers, and ""failure to give adequate warning to individuals who are at risk of dying — a warning that the Fire Department is required to give patients before withholding"

"The New York Police Department is been criticized for sending undercover officers into gay bars, but now it seems like they were caught red-handed using the same tactic in public settings.

In 2011, New York was ranked third in the country as the most accepting state when it comes to homosexuality, in that last year it had only 1.7 percent of gay citizens report being harassed or discriminated against, according to the 2010 Human Rights Watch survey. But last week, the New York Daily News reported that the police officers sent into a city park were sending gay men out into Manhattan to lure them.

The news report featured pictures of two undercover officers posing with an officer standing in front of a gay bar in Greenwich Village. The report also said that three more officers were out at the same area of West 30th Street. While the NYPD denies that there are more cops out looking for gay people, they do acknowledge that these guys were in undercover gear, but also say that it's unlikely the men who entered the police were targeting gay men.

""No matter how it is disguised, people just assume they are undercover cops,"" one spokesperson told the New York Daily News.

The NYPD and the Anti Discrimination Board have opened an investigation into the outing of the officers, but it seems that some in New York City are still very upset about how the cops entered the city.

One gay man who is part of a NYC-based group called The Gay Invisible Corps that defends gay rights, told the Daily News that they're ""incredibly frustrated.""

""I have no doubt in my mind that the NYPD made an effort to look like a straight officer and entered a gay bar,"" he said. ""This is what this has been built upon. It is built on lies and deception."""
"A few years ago, when the Republican Party was on the cusp of losing its monopoly on conservative presidential candidate, the first thing I did was stop the national Republican Party from nominating Mitt Romney.

This year, the second thing I did was look at where President Obama was on the issue of marriage equality.

Obama has been on the wrong side of this issue for a long time. In his 2004 autobiography, ""The Audacity of Hope,"" President Obama wrote that same-sex marriage ""represents a profound change that cannot be undone. But to ignore it would be a colossal mistake.... This isn't some abstract right that can be decided by some constitutional amendment. It's something that affects individuals and deserves our full, uncensored support. For generations now, American families have sought a way of life rooted in fairness and opportunity for their children. And so a vibrant gay-rights movement is part of that legacy, along with the civil rights movement as well as the women's movement.

Today, the president is once again supporting policies that are at odds with what his history reveals as his position.

First, here's his speech Tuesday when he nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court:

It is beyond comprehension how such an important document — a document that sets forth the basic principles governing this nation — can be hijacked by a handful of senators to create the illusion of a fundamental change in the United States of America. It seems that the only way to satisfy a minority would be to give up even more of its most deeply cherished beliefs and values.

In response, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) issued a statement saying that by allowing a ""radical liberal"" to replace a Justice with an ""anarchist,"" and saying that ""liberal judicial activism has devastated our courts"" by holding up laws on abortion and gay marriage, the Senate is ""not living up to our constitutional duties."" (We can't believe we have to say this, but we stand corrected.)

Meanwhile, this morning we learn that Obama is asking the House and Senate to pass a resolution to affirm same-sex marriages:

The White House Tuesday urged the country to rally around marriage equality in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act. ""On behalf of President Obama, my senior advisors, and my extended family, I offer our deepest gratitude to the thousands of activists, organizations, and advocates who have supported the cause of marriage equality and for doing so in ways large and small,"" said White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. ""As America's marriage law moves in the direction of equality, we'll continue to stand alongside you, as we did when many of our fellow citizens were at risk of being deprived of the rights and benefits of marriage. We remain committed to the ideals of equality that once inspired our nation to become the most generous, welcoming, and hopeful country in the world"
"The U.S. Coast Guard continues to investigate a report of a shark encounter off the coast of Oceanside, Calif., near the city of Chula Vista.

Citing initial details of the incident, the Coast Guard reported Friday that the three-foot shark and one other swimmer were encountered in the Pacific Ocean during a dive Saturday. A rescue boat was sent to render aid.

The Coast Guard said the two survivors were able to swim to shore.

After they were rescued, all three were taken to Chula Vista. No injuries were reported.

The shark did not strike the crew during the encounter."
"The Washington Redskins are moving in the wrong direction. They've lost seven straight games and are a disaster. And yet, the team's fan base is still somehow in denial, insisting the team is better than it really is.

After the season-opening win over Atlanta, I asked Redskins fans how they were handling the disappointing 7-9 start to the season and their response to a question about the team's chances of making the playoffs -- or even qualifying for the playoffs -- was to proclaim the team still being a Super Bowl contender.

A lot of it had to do with confidence. Fans have to feel it's coming, that their team is better than it looks. There's something about the lack of playoff success that really plays to that.

""Well,"" one fan said, ""everyone thinks the team is not good. But we thought we were better than we actually were when we won the Super Bowl. We were like the '12 team.""

""I don't know why people are so angry for a team that is 7-9 and in the middle of training camp,"" another fan told me. ""I've spent a lot of time with the organization -- they have to be on the edge. The fans just can't accept that people are upset. It's just the way they are.""

Another fan responded to the question about playoff odds by telling me, basically, ""I can't believe we have to think about winning a playoff game in the next four months.""

""They just need to win one,"" another fan said of the Redskins."" It's crazy to be in this situation, but people haven't come out and said that. They haven't asked them to do anything. So it's their job to lose every game, and I hate it for them. They've lost too many games. The players know it. They are on edge. It shows. They are hurting so often. It's awful.""

Even fans who don't like the team as much as others do, however, do think its a Super Bowl team. ""I think they have a chance,"" one fan said. ""It's a good team.""

There's also another issue: the team's on-field performance -- and how fan frustration with that on-field performance is often perceived by its supporters as an assault on their own perceived Super Bowl-winning culture.

The Redskins lost their first five games and haven't looked like world beater since, and that was despite being down, 7-0 to, in some ways, the biggest team on the planet during the first three weeks of the season. They're not the same team, not even close to the team that won a title in 2010. That team was dominant. They just aren't.

So to a lot of fans, the feeling is, ""It just doesn't matter.""

For many fans, losing to Atlanta was a sign that"
"The federal government's plan to spend $9 billion over the next decade buying new fighter jets from Canada and exporting them elsewhere without first obtaining an export permit from Ottawa is raising serious concerns about the government's ability to manage such a huge program.

At the same time, the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has been dogged by cost overruns and delays that have delayed the program, and with the Conservatives now in power, the government's ability to manage the F-35 program is also under scrutiny.

The F-35 is the most expensive weapons program in Canadian history, and the Department of National Defence is now expected to spend almost $9 billion over the next decade buying new fighter jets from Canada and exporting them elsewhere without first obtaining an export permit from Ottawa.

The Harper government has claimed that it is able to manage the F-35 program because of its export control regime, which allows the government to approve a sale only if it can be proven to be in the national interest.

But the government has not been able to demonstrate that the export permit is necessary or is necessary to manage the F-35 project, and the new Liberal government has promised to repeal the export control regime.

The permit process is expected to be a major stumbling block for the F-35 program, because Canada's export control regime is a prime concern for the military, says a report by the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.

The report says that the Canadian government, which has aggressively marketed the F-35 as an affordable, air-superiority-oriented fighter, is now facing a potential dilemma because it is not sure how to manage the F-35 without first obtaining an export permit.

""While the Canadian government and industry have been quick to emphasize that the export control regime is an important safeguard to protect Canadian jobs, the Canadian Global Affairs Institute argues that the government needs a more comprehensive understanding of the risks of the current regime before considering the reforms,"" says the report.

The report says that the Canadian government has not been able to demonstrate that the export control regime is necessary or is necessary to manage the F-35 project

The report argues that the Harper government has not been able to demonstrate that the export control regime is necessary or is necessary to manage the F-35 project.

It also says that until it is clear how the current export control regime will be replaced by a new regime, the Harper government should not proceed with the F-35 purchase and should instead focus on upgrading the CF-18 fleet.

""If the new export control regime is not well established, it may prove unworkable and hard to manage,"" says the report.

"Gone are the days of open-carry activists and gunslingers patrolling the streets of the Lone Star State. The state's new gun laws have made it easier for gun owners to conceal their weapons, and the number of concealed handgun license holders in Texas has hit a record high.

According to data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, about 2.8 million people hold concealed handgun licenses in the state. That's up from 1.3 million in 2014.

""Tens of thousands of Texans are carrying concealed handguns in public, and they're having a positive impact on public safety,"" said Dan Spencer, the director of the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. ""This is the most conservative state in the nation for concealed handgun license holders.""

In Texas, it's illegal to openly carry a handgun without a license. However, a license is not required to take a gun on a public college campus, at a church or private business.

According to Spencer, it's a ""big surprise"" that more people are getting concealed handgun licenses.

""We saw that there was a decline in concealed carry licenses in the first three years that concealed carry was allowed in the state,"" he said. ""We've seen that there's been a big increase since the law was signed, and it's not surprising.""

Here's a breakdown of who holds concealed handgun licenses in Texas, according to data from the DPS:"

"A week passed quickly since the new year's day attack that saw two gunmen killing more than 20 people during the opening day of a regional New Year's Eve concert in Berlin, while seven others remained in a critical condition.

The attack took place on Breitscheidplatz Square, or Alexanderplatz, which is near the famous Brandenburg Gate. About 3,000 people were attending a midnight New Year's Eve festival with fireworks at the time of the attack.

The injured included four police officers, two of whom were seriously hurt. Two police officers were also stabbed, while five people suffered gunshot wounds. Twenty-two others suffered only minor injuries. Three German citizens were among the injured.

The attacks are reportedly carried out by a lone attacker, who has not yet been identified. He was said to have fired four shots from a 9 mm Glock 9mm handgun, two of which hit the German flag, before he was shot. A police source told Bild it appeared that the suspect was on drugs.

At least one policeman was slightly injured. In an address given by the mayor of Berlin earlier in the day, she called for further security precautions to be taken.

""This must not happen again in 2017. We must take it to the limit,"" Brandenburg's mayor Annette Schavan said.

German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere called for ""a special security plan for Berlin,"" adding that German politicians ""must urgently understand that they have to live in peace in their own capital.""

The incident comes amid an increasing terror threat in Germany and other Western countries, the BBC reports.

It marks a ""new and terrifying level of threat"" against Germany, with the government warning that attacks are still ""highly likely,"" the BBC reports. The country has been on high alert since the November 13th attack on Paris, which claimed the lives of 130 people.

Last month, authorities revealed an apparent link between the Berlin massacre and a string of attacks in the German capital.

Police raided the property of the assailant last week, and discovered the weapons and ammunition. In a statement Tuesday, police officials said the suspect had had extensive criminal records and was known to German authorities.

""Following the shooting there was still a lot of uncertainty as to the perpetrator's motive so it was decided that the search of his home was made,"" Dresden's police chief Harald Range stated, adding that it took several days to confirm the information.

"What is the best way to tackle the ""red tape"" that prevents many people from buying guns? For many, it's a process that can be simplified.

In a video recently posted on Facebook, a woman named Heather Jaye explains why she doesn't like waiting for federal background checks to clear before purchasing a gun. ""If I'm shopping for a gun and I'm at a gun store, and I have to wait five days before I can actually purchase the gun, I'm not going to do that,"" she says.

Jaye adds that the process is slow and convoluted, but that it's not a big deal: ""I mean, I can wait five days, but it's no different than waiting five minutes for a cup of coffee."" It turns out that Jaye's reasoning is not quite right -- but she's not alone.

In fact, gun control advocates frequently cite the fact that they can wait a few days for a background check to go through as an example of why they should not wait for additional background checks.

""If you want a gun, you can wait,"" the NRA's Wayne LaPierre once said, reportedly to applause.

Gun control advocates have made a similar case, with the important difference that they call for waiting the five days they make guns out to be purchased. They argue that law-abiding citizens don't have to wait five days -- that they can go to a gun store and pick up a gun immediately.

The problem is that the law does not allow anyone to purchase a gun on the spot.

The way it works is that licensed gun dealers have to ask the FBI to run a background check on everyone who wants to buy a gun. The FBI then sends the information to the ATF, which runs the check. The next step is for the ATF to run the check to see if the gun dealer heard back from the FBI.

If the dealer received an answer, they have to run the check again. If they don't hear back, they can't sell the gun.

The idea is that every single time someone wants to purchase a gun, the FBI runs the background check, the ATF runs the check, and the gun dealer has to run the check -- and they have to do all of this again.

That's a lot of time.

The statistics on background checks are hard to come by, but a recent study from the Government Accountability Office found that it takes a total of 177 days -- the average amount of time it took the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to process background checks in 2011 -- for people to get a handgun.

That's a lot more time than the average gun user needs to wait for a background check.

The NICS system has a backlog of about 4.2 million background checks waiting to be processed each month. Because it takes the FBI so long to run those checks,"

"DALLAS (AP) — A Dallas man has died on the job after falling seven stories from his fourth-floor window, a medical examiner said Monday.

Authorities haven't identified the man who died Monday, but his family said he was a construction worker who used a ladder to get from his apartment to work.

It wasn't immediately clear why he fell. Dallas Police spokesman Sgt. James Hanna said in a statement that investigators would not speculate about the cause of death. Hanna said the man lived alone.

Police say the building's owner had contacted police after it was reported the man had fallen from the fourth-story window. His name wasn't released, but the Dallas Morning News reported that the man's brother lives nearby.

Dr. John B. Clark, chief medical examiner, said Monday that the man died at the hospital.

"The former director of the United Nations' refugee agency in Iraq, Louise Ellman, says Donald Trump's plans for a wall across the US-Mexico border could create a ""catastrophic"" situation in the north.

The Republican presidential front-runner, who has promised to make Mexico pay for a wall, promised to close American detention centres in El Paso, Texas. The US has more than 2,000 immigration detention centres.

Ms Ellman, who had been head of the UNHCR in Iraq from 2012 until 2015, said a wall along the US-Mexico border could result in more displaced people.

""We do think it's a really big mistake, there cannot be a wall in the southern border. People who arrive illegally need protection, but a wall will be a big step backwards for human rights across the United States by increasing the levels of fear and anxiety,"" she told the BBC.

""It's a very, very big mistake to take the border from a place of freedom. El Paso has taken an extraordinarily difficult political decision to build this border fence.""

'Tough measures'

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A wall on the US-Mexico border could exacerbate migration

Last year, the US closed its only immigration detention facility in the federal penitentiaries in Tucson, Arizona, meaning detainees were either released into the US, or transferred to US immigration detention centres.

The US-Mexico border area was also included in a 2012 memo from then Mexican President Felipe Calderon, which sought to reduce the number of people crossing between the countries.

The memo called for ""tough measures"" including sending US-citizen criminals back to Mexico, as well as measures to increase collaboration, and to address US concerns that migrants would end up being sent to ""uninhabitable"" environments in Central America.

""There is a lot the US could do to cooperate with Mexico to reduce the flows,"" Ms Ellman said. ""But of course the other point... is that for any sort of collaboration to take place Mexico would have to be convinced of the value of it.""

She went on to say that Mr Trump's immigration policies could be perceived as a threat not just to Mexico, but to US national security.

""We've known for decades we have significant migration from Mexico. It's never a large number, but it's significant enough that we have to take a stand,"" she said.

""I think that with a Trump presidency that's certainly the first test this administration will have in terms of that cooperation."""
"Gemini 1.2.0 is now available! This is a major milestone for Gemini with several exciting new features under the hood:

The gem's design is now open-source

Gemini supports full-stack web development on Ruby 1.9+

Gemini can be deployed to cloud providers using the Unicorn gem

Many important fixes and improvements

We have also made several improvements related to installation:

Bundles are available in a RubyGems.org registry now

The Gemfile is now included in the installation process, making it easier to update and start using Gemini

Installers and scripts are included in the Gemini installer

You will find the new design in the full list of commits on GitHub.

Download the new version or follow the instructions below to get your copy now!

To install the Gemini Gem from the command line, install the gem:

gem install gemini

The Gemini 1.2 Gem is a Ruby framework designed to help you develop and publish full-stack web applications with as little effort as possible for as little money as possible. Our goal at Gemini is to reduce complexity as much as possible, so as much as possible we decided to keep the same fundamental design philosophy:

Full-stack development with minimal investment

Ruby and Rails on top

Minimal dependencies in production

The philosophy can be summarized as follows:

1. Simplicity

We believe you should not break your application to try to achieve a particular UI.

2. Flexibility

We believe you should not need an intermediary middleware like a web router to create a full stack application.

3. Ease of Use

We believe you should use Ruby in a way that's appropriate for full-stack development (for instance, by using blocks, if or end block, or other ""light weight"" constructs) so you can leverage Ruby's powerful features in your application without having to think about these.

4. Completeness

We believe you should never get too attached to some part of your application, and we will never add arbitrary requirements that you don't need (for instance, always return nil for request if no response exists) (see our documentation about the concept of correctness).

In sum, we believe in a lightweight-as-possible design that avoids complexity. We also believe the benefits of Ruby outweigh the complexity, so we decided to implement that design.

Why we built Gemini?

The main goals of Gemini were (in no particular order):

Less complexity

Simpler application design

Simplified deployment

Reduced costs

More ease of use

How did we arrive at the design and the implementation?

Our design philosophy is to keep things simple. We want to make sure that even"

"What is it?

This is a small utility that allows you to extract the name (and sometimes domain name) of the IP address given in a DHCP request to a host. You can then use this information to determine the name of the local network interface on your host.

When you run it, it will create a new file called ip_name.txt in the same directory as the program, and then it will create a file called ip_name.txt.old in the same directory as the new file. By default it only extracts the first ten IP addresses, but you can change this to whatever you like.

Using it

First, you'll need to ensure that you have a working copy of Fedora. First, you'll need to enable NetworkManager. Next, you'll need to ensure that the network interface is configured to use DHCP (it should be) and that you have a valid address for that interface. Finally, you'll need to make sure the networking module is loaded.

Next, configure networking (NetworkManager > Configuration > Networking). Uncheck the box that says ""Enable DHCP"" and make sure the following options are checked:

Module option:

DHCP: yes

Service:

If you don't want to use DHCP, you can set the following properties:

Auto-detect: yes

Auto-detect interface: yes

Next, you'll need to ensure that NetworkManager is running. NetworkManager > System > List Connections. Then, look for the interface that you configured NetworkManager to use, and check that it is listed. This can be done by either typing in the command ip link show and checking the interface that you are connected to, or by using the command ifconfig.

Next, on the local host, you can use the ip_name utility to extract the name of the network interface. When you run ip_name, it will create a file named ip_name.txt in the same directory as the program.

Once you have the name of the network interface, you can use the ip_name utility to determine the name of the local network interface. Just make sure that you use the name that you extracted from the remote host.

If you run ip_name on the same host that you ran the program, you will see that the file ip_name.txt has the same name as the hostname. This means that the hostname is actually the name that you specified on the remote host."

A British tourist, who claimed she was attacked by a group of 'Arab' men - shouting 'Britain first' - was jailed for nine months today.

Mikaela Williams, 30, from London, was arrested after telling police she was attacked by four men near the French border and fled for her life.

But today after the trial of two of the men was finished, she was spared jail even though she admitted falsely claiming she was attacked.

Scroll down for more...

The trial at Manchester Crown Court saw the pair, aged 28 and 24, stand trial on May 3 and May 24 on charges of violent disorder.

At the final day of the hearing, a five-day trial at Manchester Crown Court, Mrs Williams said she was attacked after shouting 'Britain first' whilst walking home early on August 1.

She told police she was assaulted and robbed after being approached by a group of eight or 10 men, with one throwing a punch which left her with a black eye.

Mrs Williams told police she was attacked and robbed after being approached by a group of eight or 10 men, with one throwing a punch

But a forensic analysis of her clothes at Manchester City Hospital found no trace of a punch, while there were no injuries to her legs, wrists or face.

She also claimed she was subjected to racist abuse, and saw people shout 'Get out of the country, scum' and, she told the court: 'When I tried to escape I got a full head-lock and was kicked in the ribs, and one guy told me to ""f*** off back to your own country"", but I didn't have any problem turning round when I saw how angry the people were'.

But when she went to see police, she was told they had already been through CCTV footage of the incident.

The prosecution claimed the attackers had shouted 'Britain first' and 'this country is for the white men' and she had been subjected in her ordeal to a 'brutal attack'.

After the jury returned their verdicts last week, the 29-year-old said: ""I just want to say I'm totally devastated by the way I've been treated. I've just been through eight weeks of hell, and I've had to watch the two boys from my local council being convicted of a crime I didn't commit...It's a good day for me, because I'm glad it's over but it feels like another one will lie ahead - I just want it to be over, thank god my children are safe.""

She had originally walked into hospital to get treatment for severe bruising and swelling from her jaw, but when she refused treatment to her cheek, the police arrived and arrested her.

What happens if a person who's lived in public housing for any stretch of time comes to hate it so much that he's willing to commit violence, or even kill, in order to get his way?

As it happens, several people — including a former resident of two housing projects — have been killed this way in New York City. What happened?

The answer seems to be a mix of anger, frustration, and what social scientists call a ""lack of social capital."" The housing projects were built in the 1970s and 1980s among a wave of citywide development efforts designed to reduce crime. But as they're demolished, residents seem eager to prove that the projects did more harm than good.

Many of the deaths were blamed on drug-dealing residents who were being squeezed out of public housing by gentrifiers, according to the New York Times. New York City is the nation's most expensive city for rent, not to mention the worst for violent crime.

""The housing projects in New York City continue to be a kind of flash point in society's attitude towards housing policy,"" said Christopher Jencks, an associate professor at Columbia University who has studied the issue. ""But in spite of the problems, housing policy is still seen as the ultimate social justice issue.""

This is part of why the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), which oversees the remaining housing projects, released a report this week saying that public housing is no longer the ""poster child"" of the country's housing shortage. Instead, they believe that the number of units can be met by the city's existing population of poor and homeless.

In New York, public housing has long been seen as the place where the homeless are. But, since the 2008 recession, it's also been the backdrop of violent crime in the city. (A recent national study estimated that there's a two-thirds chance someone you care about will be victims of violent crime and other urban ills this year.) The HPD report claims that public housing residents don't have the same violent tendencies that people living in some other neighborhoods might display. And many of these residents are often from large immigrant, mostly black and Latino families.

Most studies of the housing projects found high crime rate, while others have found lower — and some say it doesn't say much about a community's social capital. One study, for instance, found that many of the residents living in New York City's public housing projects came from families who grew up in poor rural areas or were the children of single parents.

Jennifer Lee-Koch, a professor at Columbia University, conducted a study of the city's housing projects through the 1960s and argued that people"

"The military has ""no plan"" to deport any Central American children who have crossed the border illegally into the U.S. under the Obama Administration, and the Defense Department ""has no plans"" to send any to the U.S., said John Kelly, the White House chief of staff.

Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly said that his department has ""no plan"" to deport any children who have crossed the border illegally into the U.S. (photo: C-SPAN)

""As a practical matter, we don't have a plan to do that,"" Kelly said Tuesday during a press conference. ""We are not planning to do that. And we're not going to try to do that.""

He said that the Department of Homeland Security is focused on ""bringing a humanitarian solution to the crisis"" and that there are a ""huge number"" of families trying to get into the U.S.

Kelly also said that he is ""absolutely confident"" the U.S. will be able to properly monitor immigration status of these children who have crossed the border illegally.

""We are doing everything we can to ensure that we have a border that is secure,"" the Secretary of Homeland Security said. ""We're going to do everything we can to bring a humanitarian solution to this crisis.""

More than 60,000 unaccompanied minors have crossed the border into the U.S. at the southwest border with Mexico so far this year.

The Obama Administration gave ""federal benefits"" to these children, but Kelly said the Obama administration has been ""extremely ineffective"" in providing the proper protection for these children.

""I think you see the actions of the president, who is trying to make the situation right, but we're not going to put the resources into securing the border that we need,"" the Secretary of Homeland Security said.

President Trump has promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but it is unclear if he will be able to accomplish that.

""We're making progress with the wall. We are putting the right resources in place. We have the right things in place,"" Kelly said. ""Our enforcement will always be there. We're going to continue to secure.""

Kelly also said that his department's priority is to get the children out of Central America.

""We want to get these children out of the country,"" Kelly said. ""We've done it in the past with other children. We are doing it now with these children.""

Asked if he was concerned about the refugees that are still in the U.S., Kelly said: ""We're working on that as well."""
"Those in the room, including Iain Duncan Smith and Theresa May, were not only warned that the government was not going to deliver on its promise, but they were also warned that doing so would alienate voters.

For months, May has been under pressure to give the public more of a say in the direction of her government, after a string of snap general elections left her party under pressure in many parts of the country.

But she failed to listen to her own backbenchers, who warned that ignoring the public would not only be a mistake, but would also be deeply unpopular.

Now, a new book has revealed that the new prime minister was told that the plans were ""ridiculous"", as she was preparing to make the announcement in the House of Commons on Monday.

The book, by the Conservative MP John Redwood, which is set to be released on Tuesday, claims that senior ministers including Iain Duncan Smith and Theresa May were told in meetings at Downing Street that the plan to give the public a vote on EU membership was ""ridiculous"".

The book, How to Stop Brexit, has been written by Redwood in collaboration with two former Conservative MPs, Andrew Boff, who is now a member of the European Research Group, and Chris Hanretty, a professor at the University of East Anglia.

It claims that they were told by ""senior sources"" that the plan was ""ridiculous"", and that the prime minister was ""not going to make it"", with Mr Duncan Smith saying ""this was nonsense"" and Ms May saying it would be ""stupid and dangerous"".

The book, which will be published on Tuesday, says that the prime minister was also told that the number of voters who would vote to leave the EU would be smaller than the number who would vote to stay, and that there was a risk that the government could lose the referendum.

The book claims that the government was told that the risk to the government was ""more than the probability of losing"", with ""more than 50% of the electorate supporting remaining in the EU"", so having no say in the matter would be ""a disaster"".

""It was not a serious plan. It was ridiculous,"" said one senior minister in the coalition between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists when they were in government.

""We were told there was no way we could get the exit vote to be a majority vote. The problem was the electorate would not like it and they would not change their minds.""

In an article for the Telegraph, Mr Redwood said that he believed that the deal was already done, but the only way to break the deadlock would be to resign.

""We all know that Theresa May knows that she cannot get the exit vote through. She knows that she has no mandate. She knows that the Tories will lose again. And she knows that the only way"
"It's something of a paradox: An American economic boom has led to a dramatic rise in inequality in the United States. But a growing body of research shows that, while inequality has risen, the growth of that inequality is not necessarily the result of market forces that encourage the wealthy to become richer.

Instead, the new research suggests that the rise in inequality is a result of a very different kind of trend: the rise of America as an economic power.

""The United States is the most unequal rich country in the world, but it's a rich country that's growing richer,"" said Thomas Piketty, the author of the new book, ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century,"" which looks at the rise of the top 1 percent of Americans, the 1 percent of Americans with the largest incomes, and the expanding gap between the rich and the poor.

"World Cup 2014: Portugal defeated Belgium 1-0 in extra time to win Euro 2012 on Sunday - BBC Sport Online

The Portuguese side have come through their qualifying campaign unbeaten and will next face Ukraine in a play-off for fourth place.

However, the Belgium side are upset that they were not able to make the play-off.

They are second in Group C following their 1-0 win over Luxembourg on Thursday.

Portugal, who play England in their next World Cup qualifier in Romania on 13 March, will play their play-off game against Ukraine in Lisbon on 23 March.

Portugal boss Fernando Santos said his side are determined to close the gap on their rivals.

""I'm not worried about the play-off,"" said the 44-year-old, who took over from Luis Figo in June.

""Belgium are a team that have been playing in this competition for many years.

""I think we can get a result and go to Kiev and try to close the gap.

""We have to give our all and we have to do everything to go through.""

Belgium boss Marc Wilmots also expressed disappointment at missing out on the play-off.

""We will have to learn from their mistake,"" he said. ""It was a perfect game from the Belgium side.

""I am not happy with the result because we can do better but we cannot change the result.

""We were the better team in the game and we were the better team in the first half.""

Belgium, who went into the game having failed to win in their last 16 games in all competitions, responded with a superb goal from Eden Hazard to level the series.

The game ended in a 1-1 draw, with both teams' substitutes taking the lead before the final whistle."
"I'm writing to you because we are not talking about a problem that will be solved by a mass demographic shift. We're talking about a problem that will be solved by a mass demographic shift that is already happening.

We are talking about the problem of an increasingly wealthy minority who are not only more than happy to accept the status quo, but are actively working to make it even better. We are talking about the fact that we are not talking about a problem that will be solved by a mass demographic shift, but a problem that will be solved by a mass demographic shift that is already happening.

It's easy to imagine how this demographic shift will play out. We are already seeing the effects of this demographic shift. For example, a recent article from The Atlantic was titled ""The New Rich Are Mostly White and Male"". All of the articles on ""new rich"" that I've seen agree that the new rich are predominantly white and male. And the article even mentions that this trend is especially pronounced among the young. The article, in fact, went on to say that ""the majority of the new rich are white men between the ages of 22 and 34 who have a college education"".

This problem is not about white male college graduates. It's about the new rich, and the new rich are predominantly white and male.

I'm not sure how to feel about this. On one hand, the young are the future. On the other, we are already losing the future.

As a result of this demographic shift, the average net worth of American households has dropped to just over $70,000. This trend is not going to change. We will see this trend continue.

We are already seeing this demographic shift play out in the U.S. in real, tangible ways. We are already seeing an increase in the number of people who are unemployed.

"Much has been written about the lack of anti-Semitism in German political and media life. In the end, however, all is not lost. Though the country has not yet reached the kind of anti-Semitic fever that it saw in the post-World War II era, anti-Semitism still exists in Germany, particularly in the left-wing, anti-capitalist milieu.

Last week, the German weekly Der Spiegel (in English) published a deeply disturbing article about a former member of the Left Party, a far-left party. His name is Simon Wiesenthal. He was once a loyal member of the party, and so devoted to its ideology that he helped found the Association of Jewish Communities in Germany.

But he started questioning the party's ideology, and he was kicked out. In the course of his investigation, Wiesenthal found out that the rights of the Jews in Germany had been violated during the war. He also came to the conclusion that the Nazis had been intentionally misrepresented in the history books.

What was the Left Party's role in the persecution of the Jews? The answer is that the party was not able to stop it. The party's founder, Otto Frank, was particularly close to the Nazis, and he even had a little boy with a Jewish mother.

When Wiesenthal asked Frank about this, he said, ""The Jews were sent to the concentration camps. I don't know of any case in which the Jews were sent by the Left Party.""

Wiesenthal quickly found out that hundreds of thousands of Jews had been murdered by the Nazis, and the party itself was complicit in this crime. After the war, the party tried to cover up its Nazi past, and it even changed its name to the Social Democratic Party, a name it still uses today.

So, what does this mean for the left? Wiesenthal's revelations have already damaged the Left Party. They have also touched on a more dangerous problem in German politics: the increasing anti-Semitism that is being preached by the left.

It is easy to forget that the left in Germany is not a homogeneous group. Some of the party's members are more liberal, and others are more conservative. But, in general, they all agree that the Jews in Germany were victims of the Nazi regime.

The left has never been perfect when it comes to anti-Semitism. In the early- to mid-1900s, the left was much more tolerant. It was good enough for the left to take a stand against anti-Semitism in the long run. The party had to choose between the empty promise of ""reconciliation"" with the Nazis, and the horrible reality of the Nazi terror.

But now, the left is not in the position of having to choose between anti-Semitism and anti-capitalism — a choice that the right has always had to face.

This book's a real gem. I read it on Kindle when I saw the price online after getting a pre-order. I didn't realize at first that I had already pre-ordered the book for Christmas so I could read it during my break, I was pretty excited. My girlfriend was also excited about it, but she didn't think I should read it because I'm already reading it, and she's usually not one to tell me I'm not read enough.

Now, it's my birthday (November 18), and I'm in need of a novel and no one should be better!

I'm a writer, and I'm in love with the way it plays with all that's going on with me right now. So many things have been going on in me and some I'm not able to control, some are happening to me that I just know will make me cry. As a writer, that is so hard but the way we treat those moments are so precious. I am in love with how this book plays with all that it wants to do with the emotions that are playing with me. I don't really have a word for the feeling that I have right now but it feels like the heart just stopped for a second and I just couldn't get it back, it's so beautiful.

I think that if I got into another book after reading this one it would be something like if I'd read Harry Potter and had a love story that made love look beautiful, but I would definitely enjoy this book more because it has all those things going on with me. The way it plays with my emotions, it touches me so much and gives me so much to think about.

You can't get away from the emotions that are playing with me with this book, the way my emotions flow through my body, it's unbelievable. I know that it's not real but it's just so nice to read.

My most favorite part was when I finally got everything written down. I was reading and was just looking at the end of the book. I kept asking myself, how did she write down everything? Why didn't it happen before? And finally, I just figured it out. It's because the characters were going through an event and as they were going through their event she was writing down everything that they were going through and writing it down. I started reading her journal and it was amazing to read because it was so detailed and so beautiful. I didn't realize how much she loves writing so many of those things."

"guitarists in the world can't seem to agree on anything—but it turns out that they also can't agree on being called a guitarist.

Case in point: New York's own Matt Cameron. He's a member of the band Rancid and has a new guitar, but occasionally, he'll be seen playing a Gibson Les Paul.

""I think sometimes I'm just being facetious,"" he told Guitar World last year. ""I don't think it's a big deal, but it's a little strange to me.""

It's not the first time he's been a little light-hearted on the subject. Cameron has been known to joke about his guitar playing on his own band's song ""Guitar Player,"" which was written by ""Pumped Up Kicks"" bassist Eric Sogard. But the joke's not funny anymore.

""I think what's funny is that I'm not a guitar player, and I think everybody in the music business is a guitar player,"" he said. ""There's no question about it.""

Matt's not alone.

Formed in 1995, Rancid is regarded as one of the most influential and influential bands of the last decade. Guitarists from such bands as Slayer, Metallica and Anthrax often cite Rancid as a major influence.

The band has also been extremely vocal about the subject.

""People always ask me about my guitar playing,"" Matt said in a 2009 interview. ""I'm just like: 'Well, I'm not a guitar player. I'm a bass player. I just play the drums.'""

Rancid guitarist Dave Lombardo, who worked with the group on their last album ""Reign of Terror"" released earlier this year, agreed.

""We don't like to get into all the band's riffs and everything,"" he told Guitar World. ""If we pay attention to that stuff, we're lost. We just type them in and let it be. We don't really talk about it.""

Rancid's 2009 album ""Reign of Terror"" was written during a creative slump for the band, but they're not really talking about it anymore.

""We wrote a whole bunch of stuff just for fun, but it was all written in the last six months of our lives,"" Lombardo said. ""It was just right before we had to go to LA and record.""

When he was asked if he'd ever play a guitar in Rancid, Lombardo was adamant.

""No,"" he told Guitar World. ""I'll play in my band."""

When the town of Alameda, Calif. tries to move a homeless encampment, it begins to deteriorate. As it falls apart, the mayor decides to use his power to evict the residents."
"""How much more did we ask you and what more was that?"" the minister of the state asked.

""You just asked for more than our budget said he told her.

""You are just asking for more as long as the government says so, I don't believe that you are even asking for more that what the government is supposed to be doing.

""Just give us some more money and, of course, we will give you some more.""

Ms Smith said there was no plan to spend more in the coming months and only asked for more so they could continue the work that had been started in recent months.

As to the issue of homelessness, the minister said $500,000 in new funds had been approved for the region to expand shelters as the government had a plan in place that was working and ""the answer to the problem of those people that are sleeping rough is not to ask for more money, our answer is to do more with what we already have"".

""This isn't new territory that the government is going to wake up tomorrow and say 'oh look we have a problem,' it is a well-proven problem,"" Ms Smith said.

Ms Smith rejected calls for the government to return another $250,000 to homeless people who were forced onto government-provided accommodation.

The government had already returned $260,000 to people who were on government-funded social housing and could not afford private housing.

""It is the responsibility to fund that housing,"" Ms Smith said."
"The Obama Administration today announced a new White House Task force to address immigration, emphasizing that the President has a ""fundamental mandate"" to act on immigration through an executive order. The policy paper for the group details several proposed actions to create a path to legalization for those here in the United States who ""have been in the United States for an extended period of time,"" without the right to sponsor their parents.

""The question before the Administration is this: What kind of country does America want to be? We must recognize that our immigration system is broken,"" said President Obama. ""It needs to work better, not just for Americans, but also for those who come here to build a better future for their families,"" he said.

According to a White House official, the new group will advise the President on how to deal with current and future immigration legislation, as well as the role of Congress in that process.

The new Task Force will include members from the Departments of Homeland Security, State and Justice, and the Office of Management and Budget. These will be chaired by ICE director John Morton and include experts from outside the immigration community from organizations such as the American Immigration Council, the Economic Policy Institute, National Immigration Forum and The New York Times.

According to the press release, the Task Force will ""develop and issue recommendations on how to increase enforcement activities, streamline legal immigration processes, reform government systems, and create a legislative path"" for allowing those here to bring their parents to the country.

This is important news, and it's an indication that those in the Administration feel that Obama has a fundamental mandate to act on immigration through an executive order in 2017. A number of recent polls have shown that a large number of Americans support such an action, so with this new group of advisors on board, could be a step toward an executive order?

But, as we noted last November, the Congressional bill to deal with immigration reform has not been reintroduced yet, and so we should not read too much into its existence as a priority right now.

The White House Task Force will release its official ""Policy Statement"" at a later date.

New Research on How Immigration Restrictions Deter Immigration From Mexico to the U.S.

New Research Says That Restrictions on Immigrants From Mexico Are Actually Destroying America Through Incompetence in Education"
"(CNN) The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted Tuesday night for a resolution that would make it harder for the Department of Justice to use information obtained through controversial sting operations to get convictions in federal cases.

The measure, introduced Monday by Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, would ban sting operations which rely on the cooperation of targets, including people who have previously been arrested, in order to catch individuals engaging in illegal activities.

If approved by the full House, the bill will be attached to two other appropriations bills this Congress and would also need to have the approval of President Donald Trump.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday while ""I think it makes sense to restrict federal law enforcement, that's the best way to address that.... This is part of a larger story that we're still working on with the president. He's going to work through his team on this.... The purpose of this was not to target particular people. It was to prevent future crimes happening.""

Chaffetz said he's seen no evidence that an individual was arrested because of the surveillance -- a tactic that's been used many times in the United States and often involves FBI agents posing as people who have no affiliation with crimes.

The practice is controversial because of its secrecy.

What's the harm?

According to the Office of the Inspector General, sting operations can lead to the unlawful arrest of targets. They can also cause people to be falsely accused, given false information, or ""subject to coercion"" in order to participate.

"After five years of planning, President Trump has finally signed an official order to implement new immigration restrictions meant to halt a humanitarian disaster that could engulf a lot of American cities, according to experts.

A series of federal court rulings over the past several years have struck down Trump's executive order which threatened to cut off funds from funding and sanctuary cities (where state and local law enforcement don't cooperate with federal immigration authorities) because, they said, it would be too hard to determine who would be ""entitled"" to safety and protection.

But, for a change, Trump is not backing down.

""I've put forth a new executive action which we will put in place shortly,"" he told the American Legion in a speech in Missouri. ""It's working out very nicely. So it's just going to happen, and we're going to have a very, very strict policy based on it.""

The new policy will, among other things, cut the number of H-1B visas from around 20,000 annually to only 85,000; put in place tougher vetting methods for people seeking to enter the country; and prevent people from seven terror hot spots from getting visas at all. The order will also increase the number of refugees from 50,000 to 125,000 -- a much lower number, but still significantly higher than the 20,000 who were allowed in under the Obama administration.

The final version of Trump's order has been in development since January, and the president said he had only recently received the necessary papers. He also said he expected to see more court cases that would likely help clear the way to get the new policies implemented.

Trump said that his order would take effect immediately.

""People are very, very happy,"" said Trump, though some immigrants and legal immigrants were very concerned.

The president made an appeal to those who are worried about their family members stuck in countries where they have no family and no ties.

""You know, this executive order is not being implemented in a very harsh way,"" he said. ""It's happening beautifully at a very nice pace. We're putting everybody together. We're getting people in.""

Trump said that the order was meant to go into effect immediately ""until we can figure out a way to make it work.""

That ""way"" will likely be determined as the legal battles play out over the next few months.

""The administration has had a relatively easy time getting these measures into effect, particularly because they didn't have to win federal court challenges in a way they had to challenge Obama's actions,"" Peter Spiro from the conservative-leaning think tank the National Review told Fox News. ""But I don't think there's a guarantee these orders will stick in the end, especially since the president has already signaled that the next version will be more sweeping.""

"In a study of all 100 U.S. counties with a population of at least 1.0 million, The New York Times found that counties that voted for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election had the highest median household income in the country, while counties that voted for Donald Trump had the lowest median household income.

This is according to data The Times obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, which has been gathered since 2012. As the Times notes, it's not surprising that wealthy counties tended to vote Democrat, since many of them have a high percentage of college-educated residents.

In the counties with the highest median household incomes, the median household income was $84,841. In those with the lowest median household incomes, it was $36,219.

According to the Times, the data shows that the counties with the highest median incomes are largely rural, while the counties with the lowest median incomes are mostly urban.

It's important to note that the median household income may not reflect all counties' median household income, since people may have different incomes in different counties.

The New York Times points to a 2016 study that concluded it's ""difficult to tell the causes of income inequality"" because of income gaps between counties.

"Mental illness affects more than 5.4 percent of the U.S. population, and the numbers vary widely from state to state—1.3 percent in Rhode Island, 2.2 percent in Vermont, and 4.5 percent in Rhode Island.1, 2, 3, 4 In addition to the prevalence of mental illness—and its long-term implications for individuals, families, and society—the U.S. is in the midst of a public health crisis in terms of the overall burden of mental illness.5 In 2012, there were over 30 million adults with a diagnosable mental disorder in the U.S., including 6.4 million among children—and the number of children and adolescents diagnosed with a mental illness has grown by almost 50 percent since 2000.6 Despite the increased availability of treatment options, the estimated cost of treating mental illness exceeds $1 trillion in the U.S.2, 7 The results from a recent study in New York City of 1.4 million older residents suggested that mental illness was the major cause for long-term disability among this old, largely non-poor, population.8 Similarly, more than 75 percent of adults with an anxiety disorder and more than 40 percent of people with psychiatric disorders have been diagnosed with depression.9 And in the last several decades, mental illness has been ranked one of the two leading causes of death in the U.S., alongside heart disease and cancer.10

Although the incidence of and cost of mental illness has increased over the past several decades, a few important features of mental health in particular stand out as well. First, while there is considerable variation across states in the prevalence of mental illness, the population-level estimates of mental disorder are generally similar across states. Second, the number of individuals with mental disorders has expanded over the same period, suggesting that even relatively large increases in incidence of mental disorder are not necessarily reflected in population-level increases in prevalence. Third, while the impact of mental illness, like the impact of any other public health burden, has varied as well as the prevalence of mental illness, mental illness is disproportionately experienced by lower-income communities, many of whom do not receive adequate health care.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of mental illness in health policy, with a particular focus on the role of mental illness in the U.S. health care system. The report will use a national probability survey of the prevalence of mental disorder to describe the extent to which individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression are represented in the population and to examine a range of policies and programs that have been suggested to alleviate the adverse effects of mental illness. The findings are described in terms of the role that mental illness is understood to play in the physical health and social status of individuals. The final section discusses possible solutions and suggests additional research to address the health needs of individuals with psychiatric disorders."
"""Suffering and hatred"" was chanted in front of the French embassy in Moscow on Sunday (3 December), with demonstrators angry over an anti-Islam film made in the US.

The rally drew several hundred people but police said about 100 people were dispersed by about 15 officers.

Police detained eight people at the demonstration.

Two women were arrested after they clashed with police.

On Friday, the French consulate in St Petersburg was stormed by a group of men who chanted ""Death to the infidels"", and hurled stones and eggs at the building. The US consulate was also targeted by protesters.

The protest in Moscow came after similar demonstrations were held in St Petersburg, as well as in many western Russian cities.

The rally in St Petersburg was held to protest against what protesters said was an Islamophobic film produced by American filmmaker, Sam Bacile, which has sparked a global debate. More than 200 people gathered in front of the Moscow embassy, calling for the release of the Jewish director and against terrorism against Jews.

A similar demonstration by about 1,500 people was held Sunday at an outdoor venue in the Russian capital, with a different theme, according to the RBC news agency.

The rally in Moscow was organized by several pro-Kremlin organisations, including the Federation Council's human rights committee.

Police spokeswoman Olga Grigorenko was quoted as saying that a total of 40 people were taken into custody and had been questioned, while 12 were released after being detained overnight in another part of the Russian capital.

She said that police arrested at least 10 other protesters.

Earlier, the French government announced that it had recalled its ambassador in response to the film. French President Francois Hollande described the film as ""racist"" and called on US President Barack Obama to express firm disapproval.

Obama, who met with the French president, said he would do everything possible to persuade the creators of the film to take it down.

""In terms of the kind of content of this movie, it's clearly outrageous, but we've also got to consider that there are other ways in which we deal with difficult issues,"" Obama was quoted as saying on Wednesday by Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper.

""We don't have to get into a constant state of outrage. And as this issue is debated in France at the moment... the United States of America is going to be in contact with the filmmaker in order to express our displeasure. And as soon as the situation is resolved, my hope is that this is going to allow us to refocus, to refocus our attention on how we can work together on important issues,"" he added.

French Interior Minister Manuel Valls has also said that the French government ""rejects"" the film ""to the extent that we are convinced that its creators are ignorant or stupid.""

"I am a big fan of the Burtons. You could have made a great case for the Burtons, their style, and the way that they were ahead of their time.

However, one thing that the Burtons didn't do when they entered into the denim market circa 1930 was go into it with the attitude that these jeans were meant to be worn. They simply didn't believe in their product being worn regularly. To them (and to me), the way to wear jeans was at home in the car seat.

This is where the J. Press, Made in USA jeans become so helpful. It not only shows how these jeans were made, but provides some good inspiration and a good attitude about the jeans. A great pair of jeans that actually can be worn, on the streets.

Here are a few tips in case you think back to those 1930s Burtons, or to vintage work wear (when a little bit of style and good taste would be appreciated a bit more!).

To learn more about Burtons (and the J. Press, Made in USA) click here.

How to Use Burtons for Cleaner Jeans

While the Burtons could be used for jeans that required some dirt to be taken off the surface of your leg as a bit like a good dish soap or shoe polish can.

So you would remove dirt from your legs with a bit of dish soap. The same can be done in these jeans. Take a bit of jeancloth and wet it with a bit of Burtons and gently rub your leg area with it.

And like a good dish soap can. You can also use a Burtons dryer sheet, but this will be more inelegant because it is not as easy to spread the jeancloth. Then, rub your leg area with the jean cloth. It may take you three or so washings for that leg to get as clean as you were going to get before this step.

Then wash the jean with this dish soap and it will look and feel better!

How to Wash Classic Work Wear Jeans

You can wash your classic work wear jeans (any denim that will need to be worn outdoors and that is likely not going to be washed regularly) with Burtons dryer sheets. It is a bit more messy than using a dish soap or a shoe polish. This takes some work, but will get your jeans looking better and more like your favorite pair from back in the day.

Then you just add some Burtons lint remover to clean off lint that has accumulated and you are ready to go!

And now some tips and a few things to watch out for with Burtons!

"In the vast majority of cases, we're talking about a tiny bit of water, but if a breakthrough occurs in the next five years, the potential for renewable energy will be enormous.

Right now, renewable energy is limited by the availability of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. The more renewable energy sources that are deployed, the higher the efficiency of the wind and solar power systems.

The problem is that renewable energy sources are intermittent and can't always provide energy in the peak hours. The more clean energy sources that are deployed, the more efficient the power systems can be.

To solve this problem, researchers at the University of Minnesota and the University of Maryland have developed a new type of silicon-based hybrid wind-solar power system that's both efficient and cost-effective.

The new system uses a combination of a wind turbine with a large solar panel on top. The system has a very high efficiency – about 90 percent – but it's also very inexpensive to produce. The system could provide a steady, reliable energy supply that can be generated using, for example, a wind turbine and solar panels.

Solar panels can generate electricity at night and even at times when the wind is at its smoothest. But the reliability of solar panels is limited by the amount of sunlight they receive and the amount of time it takes them to generate electricity. When there's a lot of sun, the panels can generate electricity more quickly. But when there's not much sun, the panels can't generate electricity as quickly.

The research team's hybrid system solves both of these problems. The researchers designed a system that uses a combination of the best solar panels available on the market and an efficient, yet inexpensive, wind turbine. The system uses the highest efficiency solar panels – the kind that are very popular in the United States – and a high-efficiency, yet inexpensive wind turbine. The combined system generates electricity at a steady, reliable rate, and it can be deployed on a much larger scale.

""This is a major breakthrough,"" said James Watson, co-author of a paper on the new system that was published in Energy & Environmental Science. ""It's not possible to get more than 10 percent of the energy from wind, but with this system, we can get up to 80 percent.""

Watson said that this system could be particularly valuable in developing countries, like India, where there are very few wind turbines and where the sun doesn't always shine.

""A renewable energy system like this is a game changer,"" he said. ""It's going to be very attractive for solving many of the energy problems in developing countries.""

This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, and by an International Student Award from the University of Maryland.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday rejected a proposal by congressional Republicans to partially privatize the Federal Aviation Administration by replacing the agency's troubled air traffic control system with a privately run system.

""The White House has been and continues to be opposed to privatizing any aspect of the air traffic control system,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said at a briefing. ""The administration is committed to a fully federalized air traffic control system.""

Republican Representative John Mica of Florida, a former air traffic controller, said in a statement that the FAA should put together a plan for privatizing air traffic control.

""I propose that we privatize air traffic control and this would save taxpayers billions of dollars,"" Mica said in a statement. ""It would also save the American people billions of dollars and improve air traffic system reliability.""

In a speech on Wednesday, President Barack Obama said he would ask Congress to privatize air traffic control and that if it did not, he would sign an executive order on Friday that would create a ""transparent, efficient, accountable"" system.

A public-private partnership would likely involve an operator like Southwest Airlines (LUV.N), which has already been working with the FAA on an air traffic control system for its U.S. airspace.

""There is no reason why the FAA could not work with Southwest Airlines to modernize the air traffic control system as well,"" Mica said.

But the White House's rejection of a proposal to privatize the air traffic control system comes despite indications from some of the companies vying for the contract that such a move would be in the official party's interest.

It also comes the week after the FAA made its $2 billion bid for the next three years to modernize the system, which was built by the federal government in the 1960s.

""It's a good step forward that they are looking at the way forward,"" said John Kaehny, an aviation consultant and former FAA official. ""The big question is the first year, and how much did they offer.""

The FAA is expected to pick a winner for the next three-year contract in June, and the agency said it would not comment on any moving targets.

""The FAA is not going to go out on a limb and go in a direction that runs contrary to the bipartisan support we have seen for this,"" Kaehny said.

FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said that the agency is ""committed to a modernized air traffic control system that will better protect the public and make our air transportation system more efficient and reliable.""

"After the election of President Donald Trump the anti-Trump protests in the United States have turned almost into full fledged civil war. Now that these protests have gone political the media's coverage has gone into hyper drive with both the Democratic and Republican parties trying to spin this situation into something good for the Trump supporters and that the left is the aggressor. The left's version of the events is often completely at odds with the truth which I have been trying to point out time and again.

There are now two big groups of folks who don't really like each other. One is the peaceful protesters who want no violence like the Black Lives Matter but that group is getting a lot more attention since the left started picking up their activism. The other is the violent Trump supporters who have decided they will stop the protestors and the right has gone full attack mode and is now sending armed right wing thugs to the liberal protests to get rid of them.

The people who are being assaulted by the right wing thugs for the left to call them ""Nazis"" are also called Trump supporters. The police have been ordered to arrest any Trump supporter they see even though these people are not attacking anyone. It is also becoming increasingly obvious to most that this story is being used mostly to give Trump more cover from the left who can't stand what he really stands for which being America First. The leftist media is going to do it's best to cover up the many anti-Trump protesters who have been physically attacked by the right wing thugs. I don't know if the media has a story for me explaining how they can blame Trump for these attacks while showing no evidence of any such attacks happening with the left.

The truth is that the violent right wing protesters that have attacked these liberals are the only ones that are violent because the left and Republicans have gone into full attack mode. Even before the election when the Democrats said that Trump was the enemy they did nothing if anything to help us. Now the only thing left-leaning media is doing is to show what they really are, thugs. These are the people the leftist media always show when they are attacked. It also is becoming more obvious that these thugs are not actually peaceful protesters. The left claims some of them are but the truth is these are just criminals who want their hands on all of us.

As a reminder there are now three factions on our society right now. There is the protesters against President Trump which the media is now trying to portray as a great fight against racism with liberals and the left claiming it is a fight against hate. The third has become even more confusing which is the ""violence"" by the right-wingers. There are now two groups now. We can call them ""violence"" or ""anti-hate"".

The violence is coming from the left. In the same week the media were showing what they really were calling protesters against hate, they were then reporting on a woman who was attacked and she was on"
"The federal government is putting out a call for a new captain, the head of the shipping security force and the chief executive of the Maritime Safety Authority.

The government is also seeking a new chief executive and a new director general of the safety authority.

The government has taken the unprecedented step of leaving the position of chief executive vacant and is seeking nominees to fill the chief executive's job, which is currently held by Bill McBride.

""It seems that a new chief executive is required and that will be one of the functions of the government in the short term,"" Transport Minister Marc Garneau said Thursday.

The Liberals have been under pressure to fill the chief executive's job since the resignation of his predecessor, Sean Casey, on Nov. 29.

But the Liberals have now decided to leave the job open until a new one is appointed.

Losing a chief executive would be a problem for the government, said Ross McEwan, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

""In the short term it's going to be a problem because Sean Casey was very much seen as the leader,"" McEwan said.

""He certainly took the lead on that, but it's also a problem to have the chief executive vacant for a year and a half.""

Garneau said the Liberals want to get the job done quickly, and it's their top priority.

""We've got to get this ship all right, so we've got to get the ship under control,"" Garneau said.

""This is an important job because we're saying that we can do our part in protecting the safety of Canadians and our environment.""

Garneau will meet with all the candidates for the chief executive's job on Friday, and then send a list of the names to the department of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.

It also plans to make a final decision on who will be the next chief executive by the end of the year.

The government is also seeking nominees for the new ships' security officer, the chief executive and the director general of the safety authority, as well as a new chief executive for the Canadian Coast Guard.

Garneau said the government is going to transfer the position of chief executive from the Treasury Board Secretariat to the Department of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.

The department will now be responsible for the chief executive's job and the other positions that have been vacant for some time.

Garneau said there will be a transition period, but he expects that the government will be in a position to make a new appointment to the top job within the next 30 days.

The government also said it is seeking nominees for the new deputy chief executive, the director general of the Maritime Safety Authority and for the chief engineer of the Canadian Coast Guard.

The list of nominees will eventually be published in the public registry of government appointments.

"A man was taken to hospital with a knife wound after being stabbed in a robbery in west suburban Oak Lawn early Saturday morning. It happened at about 1:40 a.m. in the 2900 block of North Halsted Street, police said.

A 20-year-old man told police he was walking to a nearby gas station to buy cigarettes when a suspect, who was wearing a black hoodie and a black baseball cap, asked him for money. The man gave him $20 and then the man punched the victim's head and held a knife to his throat.

The suspect took the victim's phone, cellphone, ID and another wallet before running away, police reported.

The man told police he went to look for the attacker for five minutes before he saw a car, later identified as a dark-colored vehicle, speeding away.

He described the car as a ""black Dodge Charger,"" had it circled twice with two people inside and called 911, police said.

Officers were flagged down by a man in the area, who said he had been stabbed by a man in a similar vehicle. The first officer saw the suspect run into the middle of the street. The man suffered knife wounds on his arm but refused treatment from paramedics until he was helped to his feet, police said.

The second officer was able to arrest the suspect immediately. He was arrested for aggravated battery with a firearm, police said."
"It's time once again for the first ""Top 100 Players of 2013"" countdown, and it's time for another round of some of my favorite players around the world. To be more specific, it's time for the ""Top 10"" players from all around the world. That's right, folks: this is one of those lists that's all sorts of diverse, including some names you probably wouldn't consider to be in the top 10 (at least on the international level anyway). So just what makes them the best?

Well, for one thing they've been at this game long enough to rack up some impressive wins, just look at how Kuznetsov racked up some big wins during the lockout shortened 2013-14 campaign:

Now if there's anyone who can actually beat Kuznetsov and pull off the ""L"" in the top 10 list, it's Evgeny Kuznetsov, and that's exactly what we'll be looking at in this round.

No Top 10 lists like this were created for the top 100 in 2011 or 2012, so I have my reasons for this. Here are the Top 10 from last year.

And for good measure, here's the Top 40 players during the lockout shortened 2012-13 season.

So why have I put Kuznetsov number one for the first time? Well, for starters, he was the player I had in mind when I was first starting this project. And secondly, he's just so damn good. Last year he had 31 points in 29 games. And in just his first season, he already has 13 goals and 16 assists for 25 points, which put him in rare company for players of his young age, even if that puts him a bit ahead of the current rookie record.

You may notice that I kept him in the same spot for this top 10 list as I did last year. To be honest, I think it's quite funny when players with big international accolades get all the attention, whereas someone like Kuznetsov, who has been winning in the KHL, has to keep fighting to get his rightful due. So there you go.

Okay, if that wasn't enough, here's the Top 50 list for 2013:

In no particular order, here's the Top 10 this time:

Kuznetsov, Evgeny. The player you've already seen a lot in the first 100 players countdown. The guy you've already seen most in the Top 50 list. The guy who could've easily been the number one player on the list. He didn't quite make it though, as teammate Alex Galchenyuk took the spot for him. And now if Kuznetsov were to make the trip to Russia to participate in the World Cup of Hockey in a few weeks, you may see him in the third spot too. As always, stay tuned for more updates throughout the offseason"

If they can afford it, they'll download the app, or if they can't afford it, they'll go to a doctor. But even if they could afford the app, they may not know what it does, or not know how to use it.

"HBO is looking to expand its original programming into Asia, with a number of shows already set to arrive in the market in coming weeks.

The Wall Street Journal reported that all three shows in particular have deals in the works: ""The Deuce,"" ""Veep,"" and ""Westworld,"" although the latter two will not debut until ""at least early spring"" of next year. The report also highlighted HBO's plans to produce two original films in the next five years, with ""Westworld"" being expected to star Anthony Hopkins and directed by Jonathan Nolan.

""Veep,"" which airs this Sunday, and ""Westworld"" join previous international seasons of ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Silicon Valley,"" ""True Detective,"" ""The Jinx,"" and ""Ballers,"" to name a few. The most recent season of ""Veep,"" which is airing its finale tonight on HBO, has been garnering a lot of interest for its satirical take on politics. The show's first season featured much of the same, with former senator turned Republican National Committee adviser Selina Meyer and the show's host, George Clooney, being called out repeatedly on Twitter for using their characters' names and likenesses.

A recent report from Fortune magazine suggested that Netflix has been in negotiations with HBO to acquire a stake in the premium cable network's international television production division. As part of that arrangement, Netflix has secured an option that, should Netflix's deal for global rights expire in 2015, it will be able to acquire up to an additional 26 hours of current HBO content.

HBO also is in the process of buying out its stake in Starz for $1 billion, which will enable it to acquire a further 16 hours of current and past Starz output for its international productions. Those productions will also benefit from additional production and storage space, increased technological security, and cost-saving opportunities."

"How Does Light Pollution Affect Headaches?

Headaches are a common problem among people around the world. The effects of light pollution include:

Increased risk of headaches

Decreased alertness

Increased sleepiness

Decreased concentration

Increased risk of headaches

A study of 3,000 people in the U.S. found that people living in light-polluted areas were 35% more likely to report headaches. Another study found that the risk of headache increased by 29% for those whose bedrooms were dark.

The risk of developing headaches increases by about 31% for every degree of light pollution increased. This is because sunlight is the main source of the room's light, and this determines the amount of light that enters the home. However, the amount of light that enters a room is not the same for every person. Therefore, people in areas with a lot of light pollution and people who are used to dark living environments may experience the same effects.

Sleepiness

People who suffer from headaches are often less alert and may wake up more often during the night. This makes it difficult to fall asleep and can cause daytime fatigue. A study of more than 1,000 people found that people who sleep in areas with a lot of light pollution have an increased risk of insomnia.

Decreased alertness

People who suffer from headaches are often less alert, which may cause them to miss important events and activities. This can have a negative impact on their work, education, and relationships.

Decreased concentration

People who suffer from headaches are often less able to concentrate at work. This makes it harder to complete their work tasks and take notes when they are required to. This can lead to increased stress and irritability.

Increased risk of migraines

Research suggests that people who suffer from headaches and other headaches are more likely to get migraines. This is because headaches are an important symptom of migraines, and migraines are often caused by light exposure.

The most common type of migraine is a migraine aura. An aura is a feeling of pressure or pressure to the eyes or face that occurs as a result of a migraine. Migraines can range from mild to severe and may involve any part of the head. As with all headaches, the severity of migraine headaches can vary greatly.

With increasing light pollution in cities, people may develop migraine headaches even if they do not have migraines.

Increased risk of sleep apnea

Sleep apnea is a condition in which a person's breathing is interrupted while they sleep. It usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood, but it can occur at any age. People who suffer from sleep apnea have a higher risk of experiencing migraines, and some research suggests that people who suffer from sleep apnea are more likely to have migraines.

Some research suggests that exposure to bright"
"A Virginia city has a new local hero.

""I'm proud to be an American and proud to be the mayor of Richmond,"" said Danica Roem, who is the first openly transgender person to be elected to any political office in the Commonwealth. ""I'm proud to be a woman and proud to be from this city.""

On Tuesday night, Roem won a seat on the Richmond City Council for the first time in her career, beating an opponent who was the first openly transgender person to be elected to a state or local office in the U.S.

Watch the full speech in the video above.

Roem, who was born a man, said she was still seeking her driver's license and had yet to register her car.

""I just want to be my own person,"" she said.

Roem, an attorney, had been an adjunct professor at the University of Mary Washington and a policy analyst with the Virginia Department of Taxation and Finance. But she said she has no regrets about her election to the council.

""I'm going to be a strong voice for my community, for women, for people of color, for immigrants, for all the people that have been marginalized by our current administration,"" she said. ""I will work as hard and as long as I can to make Richmond a better place.""

Roem said she wanted to be mayor to serve all Richmonders.

""I do not feel like I have to represent you,"" she said. ""I do not feel like there is a division in the city. I believe that every person is welcome here.""

Roem became the first openly transgender person to be elected to a local office in Virginia when she defeated incumbent Del. Bob Marshall (R-Prince William) in the November election for Virginia's 51st House of Delegates District.

Marshall, who was first elected to the Richmond City Council in 1995, was the first openly transgender person elected to state office and the first openly gay person elected to city office.

Roem said she's proud to be ""the first transgender person to ever be elected to a state office.""

Roem, who is also vice chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus in the Virginia House of Delegates, said her victory on Tuesday night is a ""breakthrough moment in our country.""

""We've been fighting for this for a long time,"" she said, noting that she is the first openly transgender person to be elected to any political office in the U.S.

""It's a great day for our community, it's a great day for women, it's a great day for people of color, it's a great day for immigrants,"" she said. ""It's a great day for everyone in this great Commonwealth.""

Roem said that she is also proud that Virginia is now the eleventh state to allow people to"

This blog post is part of an upcoming series we're calling ""What We Need to Improve in Web Performance."" We're also launching two follow-up posts that dive into the challenges around modernizing HTTP and how we're looking to improve what we have:

How fast can we make HTTP?

How fast can we make JSON?

Our goal is to understand how we got here, whether that's because some change is necessary, or whether there's something more fundamental going on. We'll also explore why we believe modernizing HTTP is critical.

Since it's become the industry standard, HTTP has grown over time, so it takes a whole lot of digging for many sites to figure out what's going poorly.

For example, we recently took the time to improve our test page, to see how other sites stack up. And in the end, we found that many of the sites with similar problems weren't even following the HTTP spec, so I'd like to tell a bit about why that matters, so this post is the start.

What Is HTTP?

HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. That's not a terribly technical description, although it would seem to imply that it uses port 80 as the transport of choice, but I'll get to that later.

HTTP is a set of protocols that implement the HTTP protocol — essentially, a set of rules that ensure the safe exchange of data within the boundaries of a network. The most common ones are HTTP, SMTP and FTP, because they were first standardized in 1995, and they've come down the years since then, in the form of several RFCs.

While it used to be that we'd only see the top layer of the protocol in the TCP and UDP headers, that's not actually the case anymore. More often than not we'll see it described right there in the transport: HTTP/1.1.

If you take a look at the header fields of a packet with a client, you'll see this:

GET /?v=1&q=1+r+i+y+n+w HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Accept-Encoding: gzip Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

That's HTTP/1.1.

HTTP/1.1 is designed for efficient transmission. It is a request/reply protocol, so there are two separate phases of communication between the client and the server — the requests/responses, which are separate entities.

The request is initiated by the client, and the response returned by the server.

The client makes a request, and the server responds by sending the results to the client.

The server sends back results back to the client, and once those are processed and the user is ready, a response is returned from the server.

This is a lot"
"Tampa Bay Lightning right wing Nikita Kucherov (18) celebrates his goal against the Arizona Coyotes during the third period of an NHL hockey game Saturday, Feb. 9, 2016, in Glendale, Ariz. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)

ALBANY, N.Y. -- With a 3-2 win over the New York Rangers on Sunday, the Tampa Bay Lightning have put themselves in a position to keep their playoff hopes alive.

It took the Lightning three games to get to this point, but they are now atop the Atlantic Division with a trio of games in hand on the Rangers.

""We're going to try to outwork them and outskate them,"" captain Steven Stamkos said. ""It's going to be a great challenge in front of us. We're just going to try to get into their zone and do the little things that we have to do to score goals.""

The Lightning have a pair of games in hand on the Islanders, who are three points back of the Rangers. It's not an insurmountable gap, but it's a gap.

""They are definitely a team we have to beat,"" Stamkos said. ""We have to get a couple wins there to secure a playoff spot. We're going to go down swinging.""

The Lightning have been in this position before. In 2014, they were in a similar situation when they were chasing a playoff spot. They were one point out of the final wild-card spot at the time.

That year, they went on to win the Presidents' Trophy. As a team, Tampa Bay's goal differential was plus-30, and they had a +24 goal differential. That was the best of any team that made the playoffs that year. They were a top-five team all season.

""We knew we had to get to the playoffs and we didn't want to be in last place,"" Lightning forward Ryan Callahan said. ""We knew it was going to be a tough road to get there, but we knew we had to get to the playoffs and we did. We finished on a high note.""

The Lightning have been in the playoffs the past three years, winning the Stanley Cup in 2013. They lost in the first round in 2014. This year, they won Game 7 against the Pittsburgh Penguins before losing in six games to the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round.

In 2014, the Lightning were swept by the New York Rangers in the first round. In 2014, the Rangers were swept by the Lightning in the second round.

""This is a very good team,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said of the Rangers. ""They're a very good team. They're playing an excellent game right now. They're very dangerous. You can't really underestimate them.""

The Rangers are playing at home. The Lightning are in their first game at Madison"

"If you're looking for the last word in punk, you'll find it in the New York Times. The Times, that bastion of liberal arts bliss, recently had a piece on the early punk scene in New York City.

The Times piece is headlined ""The New York Punk Scene."" It opens with the following:

""New York City's 'big, bad city' gave birth to the genre of punk rock, a music that defined a new generation of hard-edged rock fans, and left an indelible mark on local history.

""Among the bands that formed during the 1980s and '90s were the Slits, the Bikini Kill, the Offspring, the Offspring's sister band, the Bouncing Souls, and the Germs.

""The Sex Pistols, the Buzzcocks, Black Flag, Minor Threat, the Ramones and the Dead Kennedys all played at least one show at the Fox. And it was the Ramones who put the term 'punk' on the map, in a performance at the Fox that was so controversial that the police temporarily shut it down.

""The Ramones' performance, in which the band took over an arena in the middle of the night and played a 20-minute set of original music, was played over and over again. The show, which was dubbed ""Ramones Night,"" was a sensation in New York.

""It was one of the earliest acts to perform at the Fox. And, like many of their contemporaries, the Ramones are now considered one of the greatest bands of all time.

""The Ramones' performance at the Fox, which was broadcast by local television, was one of the first acts to play the Fox. And it was one of the first acts to perform at the Fox.

""The era of punk started in New York City, with the Slits, an early punk band formed by the late Kathy Etchingham and Kathleen Lynn Wirtz, a former basketball player, in 1980. It was the first band to play the Fox.

""The Slits got off to a shaky start. The group had little time to rehearse, and when they were finally ready to play, their equipment was destroyed in a fire. The show was canceled after just one show.

""The band laid low for two years, but eventually broke up, disbanding after the band's van was stolen. It was the second time that the band had been stolen, and in 1984, the van was stolen again.

""After the van was stolen, the Slits released a song, ""Tear Me Apart,"" which became a hit. It was the first song by a punk band to make it to the top 10 on the Billboard charts.""

The Times then goes on to list the various bands that formed at the Fox:

""The Sex Pistols"

"As a child of the 50s, the first time my father made us get up from the couch and go to the store, it was a treat that I treasure long after his demise. I spent the day making new friends and picking out gifts for my two cousins. (I've also been known, on rare occasion, to run out to a supermarket during the lunch hour, only to find out that the new, fresh, fresh thing on the shelf will actually take me at least an hour to get through the store on my own.)

I was lucky as I got to visit almost every Walmart in my immediate area and get a good sense of what all the shelves looked like, but that's not always the case. (There's no such thing as a single Walmart in every rural town in America.) And even when Walmart employees give you a good, long look through the shelves, you always have to double-check and double-check in case you've missed something: ""Oh! It looks like one of those old-fashioned-looking, red velvet-covered shelves that look like the kind used to hold things like Christmas stockings, and they really don't smell good.""

If you want to make your Christmas shopping a little easier, take the time to visit as many different stores as you can during the holidays. You will probably come across a few items you might have forgotten about, and while most of what they have on sale that day isn't going to last very long, you can usually find items you missed before. Here are some of the many kinds of things you might find at a Walmart on Black Friday:

Staples

When the price of the item drops to, say, 80 percent off, that's a discount that's easy to appreciate once you've actually bought the item and been it in the store.

If you have the time, check out the ""Super Offers"" section on Black Friday. I've personally spotted some great deals on laundry detergent, deodorant, toothpaste, body butter, deodorant, and just about every baby product on the shelves. So many of these stuffs seem to come and go, and you'll likely be able to find something you don't even know you missed, so you may be able to get some great value out of the time that you spend at the store.

Toys

You're going to want to look for toys that are in a bunch of different colours and that are not too big. You might be able to buy a $30 Nerf gun or three from Walmart that you missed the first time you went.

Food

Food coupons can be hard to find. Some stores will hold back large quantities of foods that are on the regular sale, and if you don't have coupons handy, you might have even less chance of finding deals if they're on sale. On the other hand, large price drops on grocery"

It's been a little over two years since we last saw Wagner on The CW's Arrow. Even though the character had a short run on Legends of Tomorrow, he returned for a short-lived crossover with The Flash last season. However, it looks like we'll be seeing him soon on Arrow.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Arrow showrunner Wendy Mericle confirmed that Wagner will be appearing on the show.

""I can say that we have a lot of fun with him,"" Mericle said. ""We've had a lot of fun exploring his history and his backstory. He has a lot of connections to some of the characters that we will be seeing on the show, and we're going to be seeing him soon on Arrow.""

Wagner first appeared in Arrow's second season as a rogue hacker named ""Dr. Light,"" who was sent to Earth-1 by Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) to shadow him and stop him from killing his parents.

Like his predecessor Dr. Martin Stein (Victor Garber), Wagner has since been killed off by The Flash. It's possible that he could return to the show in a flashback, should the show decide to include him.

Arrow airs on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW."
"The Holy Passover of the Jews of the Holy Land

Week of Unleavened Bread

The Passover holiday was celebrated during the week of unleavened bread. This was an important time for the Jews of the Holy Land. In the Old Testament, these Jews were driven from their land and had to make a new home in the Promised Land. The Passover meal was a reminder to the Jewish people of their exile and their salvation in the new land.

The Passover of the Jews of the Holy Land

The beginning of the Passover meal was determined by the time of year. According to the time of the year, the Passover meal was only eaten by the Jews in the land of Israel, and also in the other parts of the Holy Land. In the desert, the Jews only ate the Passover meal during the winter. The feast was also celebrated in the land of the Israelites in the spring. The feast was celebrated in the land of the Jews in the summer.

It was decided that the first Passover meal would be celebrated on the 15th day of the first month of the year. The Jews had to begin their year on the 15th of the first month of the year, the Passover. The first Passover meal was served on the night of the 15th. The first meal lasted seven days.

The Passover meal consisted of five parts. First, the Jews had to break their fast. The second part was called the ""Seder,"" which was an unleavened bread meal. The third part was two loaves called ""kosher"" bread, and the fourth part was unleavened matzo. The fifth part was a mixture of all the five parts.

The Passover timing of the Holy Day of Unleavened Bread

The first meal of the first day of the week was called the ""Seder."" The seder feast was a feast to honor the feast of Unleavened Bread. The meal was to last until evening. The seder meal was to be celebrated on the night of the 15th, since the time of the feast was determined by the time of the year.

The Holy Day of Unleavened Bread was the evening of the 15th. The Jews began their new year on the 15th, and according to the calendar, the first day of the new year was the 15th of the first month of the year. Therefore, on the 15th of the first month of the year, the seder of unleavened bread was to be celebrated. It was considered to be a holy and holy day.

The Holy Passover of the Jews of the Holy Land

The second Passover meal was the ""Seder."" The seder feast was a holy meal to honor the feast of Unleavened Bread. The seder meal was to last until evening. The seder meal was to be celebrated"
"What Do You Think?

""I can't believe they're only going to play this on Wednesday,"" said one adult film performer, not having even heard of the new series.

""It could be a gimmick,"" another performer thought to herself. ""Maybe this is where he's getting them.""

""I think it's a very good show,"" said a third adult performer, as the male porn actress on the screen began to make an audible fart, apparently as a form of sexual stimulation, her long hair flying out behind her.

2

""I wonder what he's talking about,"" said one male adult performer, looking through the program with interest.

""I've never heard of the word 'vagina' before today,"" added another male porn actor.

""This is a really bizarre move,"" remarked a male adult performer who had heard of the show only in a passing way.

3

""It looks really interesting at first,"" said some female porn performers. ""But how many will be able to keep up and finish this series?""

4

""It's not even on the TV? Is it even real?"" asked one adult performer as she turned off the TV to catch a random program on cable or maybe her husband's Xbox.

""I haven't heard of this show either,"" echoed another adult performer.

5

""I feel like this show is just a gimmick and something else is coming down the pipe, to keep us watching,"" said one female porn performer who had never heard of it. ""I think they're playing it for ratings, not to give porn performers or performers that work with them a better chance.""

6

""I think it's just like whatever's coming down the pipe they want us to watch or are trying to sell,"" agreed a fellow porn performer. ""I can't tell you how ridiculous this program is,"" agreed a colleague.

7

""I hope it's not like the one with the chicken,"" sighed another female porn performer. ""I wouldn't want to see that.""

""You know,"" said a woman from the audience at this performance, ""that's kind of the point,"" adding that she'd be a little surprised to hear of a show with anything so vulgar and vulgar that it was called ""Vaginabear."""
"A full-size model of the new Mercedes S-Class. The car was also used in the video for ""The Star-Spangled Banner"".

The new Mercedes S-Class, a model that's been on the market for nearly a decade, is getting a makeover in a few weeks. And its next owner will have the distinction of seeing the car as a whole.

The car sold at auction earlier this month is a 1970s-model example of the car that's been used in the promotional videos for the new S-Class. The car was purchased by Mecum Auctions for $1.8 million.

""This unique and highly desirable example is the most photographed Mercedes S-Class ever to be sold. It has been a vehicle used in a number of high-profile film and television productions,"" said Mecum Auctions in a statement. It's not clear if the car will be displayed at the auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, which runs Jan. 25-29.

The model shown in the video for ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was a stock-standard S-Class. It's the first time since the car's introduction in 1991 that the car has been displayed in a public setting.

The S-Class, which hasn't changed much over the years, has been the top-of-the-line model sold by Mercedes-Benz. It's also been quite popular with buyers—the car has been sold at auction more than any other new vehicle. The vehicle is also one of the most popular cars on the Mercedes-Benz roster, according to the company.

The 2013 model year S-Class has been redesigned as an all-new model. The 2014 model year S-Class has been redesigned as the ""S55,"" and the model due for launch next year, the S61, is also a redesign.

The S-Class is a four-door sedan, mid-sized luxury vehicle with a V-8 engine.

As in previous years, the new S-Class will be powered by a 6.2-liter V-8, which delivers 526 hp. The car will be powered by a seven-speed dual-clutch manual transmission.

The S-Class is designed to be a competitor to the BMW 6 Series. The car has been called the ""ultimate sports car"" by Mercedes-Benz, and it shares some key design elements with the BMW. The company says the car has ""a long history of being an icon of the Mercedes-Benz brand,"" and the S-Class is now a ""car of the future.""

"him, despite the fact that he's the only one who can look into his eyes. Because of this, he can't see anything but the corner of his eyes, which only makes him sad. The other characters are all pretty damn boring and uninteresting. I stopped caring about them a long time ago, as they never develop and they're always just there, doing one thing.I enjoyed watching the ""dark"" parts of the show, but I didn't like the whole ""if I can't have him, no one should"", story line. I didn't even believe it was true, but they try and make it seem like that's how it is. The end result is that the show becomes very predictable and everyone is just there to make the other characters happy. They don't seem to have anything new to do, or any reason to be there. The ending is also very disappointing, as I thought it was going to be good, but it just got worse and worse.The art is pretty good. The characters are pretty well drawn, and the backgrounds are pretty well drawn. The character designs are pretty much identical to the ones in other shows. The main character is the only one that's unique, the others are just the same person. The music is also pretty good, I liked the opening and ending themes, but I found the ending theme to be kind of boring. The sound effects and voice actors are pretty good and fit the character's personalities really well.Overall, I thought it was a pretty good show, but it's not as good as it could have been. I think it could have been much better if they had tried to do anything new, or change up their characters. Overall, the show is very similar to other anime's and it's not really worth watching in its entirety, so I'd recommend watching it for a few episodes and then dropping it."
"Although the U.S. is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, it is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. In the past, the United States has made progress in reducing its emissions, but this progress was less than it had hoped. In fact, the U.S. emissions have increased over the past decade. The United States is currently responsible for only 11.3 percent of global emissions.

EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy speaks during a news conference at the EPA in Washington, D.C., on June 3, 2012. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy has announced that she will resign after a year in office.

Because of this, the Obama administration has made sustained efforts to reduce emissions. Of course, all of this is subject to economic and political challenges. But the U.S. has a strong economic base and an already-strong commitment to reduce its emissions.

In the past, the United States has made progress in reducing its emissions, but this progress was less than it had hoped.

Economic Uncertainties

The Obama administration has accelerated the pace of its climate action. It has already required new power plants to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, established carbon caps for federal waterways, reduced methane emissions from oil and gas operations, and urged states to set their own targets for reducing emissions.

But these efforts may still face political resistance. Even though the United States has already made substantial progress toward reducing emissions, it is a country that has a large and rapidly growing workforce. While the economic impacts of climate change are difficult to quantify, the United States is already feeling the effects of climate change in many ways.

Because of this, the Obama administration has made sustained efforts to reduce emissions.

In the short term, the Obama administration has announced that it will require new power plants to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. In April 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it would require new coal-fired power plants to meet new carbon dioxide emission standards.

The Obama administration has also established carbon caps for federal waterways. In August 2011, EPA announced that all large water bodies, including rivers and streams, would be subject to a national limit for carbon dioxide emissions. The federal government will also soon require new power plants to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations.

For all of these reasons, the Obama administration has made sustained efforts to reduce emissions. In fact, these actions are already having an impact. In May 2012, the EPA announced that it had reduced its 2011 greenhouse gas emissions by 1.4 percent. In addition, the Obama administration has cut methane emissions by more than 50 percent from 2005 levels and plans to increase this level to 40 percent by 2025.

In addition to these actions, the president has required new power plants to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2020, and has proposed an increase of the federal carbon cap to a level that would reduce emissions"
"""The president is the first to go over to the other side when he sees that there's a situation that warrants a decision he wants to take, so he goes over there to say that he's going to take action, just as he's doing right now,"" said White House press secretary Sean Spicer in his Tuesday briefing. ""The first step in the right direction for any leader or any leader in a democracy or any leader in any country that's making national security decisions is to see what's happening on the other side first.""

President Trump, who has been criticizing the Justice Department for the months-long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, announced Monday that he was firing FBI Director James Comey. Trump's decision to fire the FBI director was met with shock and condemnation by Democrats, as well as some Republicans.

After an announcement that Comey had been fired, Spicer was asked in his Tuesday briefing about the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. 2016 election. He explained that Trump had made the decision to fire Comey before he had completed his investigation, as his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, had done.

""The president believed [at that time], and I think he said this to the country yesterday, and the director has publicly said this, that the decision to remove Comey was made before the recommendation of the Department of Justice or the deputy attorney general,"" Spicer said. ""It was an effort to allow the Department of Justice to move forward and give that process the time it needs to complete and, obviously, to put a stake through the heart of whoever the next occupant of this job would be.""

""The president is trying to be smart, and he believes that by having that decision taken before, it gives him the ability to make sure that this doesn't get in the way of the work that he wants to get done for the people of our country,"" his press secretary said.

Spicer also said that the president was not trying to influence the investigation by making a public statement the day after he was first briefed about it.

""There's a difference between trying to put pressure on an investigation and deciding that it's time to fire someone,"" Spicer said."
"What's the difference between a snowflake and an ice cream cone?

Neither! They're both simple shapes of ice cream cone.

The snowflake is the smallest of the three. It's about 5 inches tall (13 cm) and has a diameter of about 3/4 inch (1 cm). It is formed by the repeated melting of snow crystals.

The ice cream cone has a diameter of about 3 inches and is formed by the repeated melting of ice. When you melt a snowflake, the water and air in the air pocket of the snowflake is liquified and becomes ice. The ice cream cone is very similar, except the air pocket of the ice cream cone is much bigger and more solid. It is about 1/4 inch (1.3 cm) thick.

Ice cream cones and snowflakes are both shaped by the same process of cooling liquid water. Ice cream cones are usually made of chocolate, while snowflakes are usually made of vanilla.

Ice cream cones are also known as snow cones, as they float on the water.

So besides being simple shapes made of ice, what are the differences between a snowflake and an ice cream cone?

Looking for more fun facts about ice cream cones? Here's some more fun facts about ice cream cones:

Ice cream cones can be found almost anywhere.

Ice cream cones have been around a long time.

Ice cream cones are made of ice, but most people don't know that.

Ice cream cones can be found in all kinds of shapes and sizes and vary in size from a few inches to over 4 feet.

Ice cream cones are made up of water and air.

The difference between snowflakes and ice cream cones is that snowflakes are more complex and highly detailed.

Did you know that when the sun sets, the sky turns to blue? The blue sky is actually the ice crystals that have melted from the sun melting and evaporating.

Have you ever wondered how ice cream cones are made?

"SMYRNA, Ga. -- The Atlanta Falcons may have had the best record in the NFL in 2011, but the Falcons helped define the New York Jets' season.

With a 19-9 victory in Atlanta on Sunday, the Jets became the first team in NFL history to go undefeated following a 1-3 start. They are now 4-0 for the second time since 2007, when they lost their first three games.

""That's the mark of a team that is going to go to the playoffs, that's the mark of a team that is going to play the right way,"" said quarterback Mark Sanchez, who completed 21 of 37 passes for 189 yards and one touchdown against the Falcons. ""There's a lot of teams that have had that mentality, but nobody's done it in this league.""

The Jets (4-0) are playing better than they ever have over the first three weeks. They have outscored opponents by an average of 14.5 points per game, the best of any team in the NFL over that span.

Their defense has been outstanding, holding opponents to a league-low 23.5 points per game and only one touchdown. They have not allowed a rushing touchdown since Week 2.

""We respect them as a team, we respect their abilities, they've been playing great, they're very good and we're going to have to play better,"" said linebacker Calvin Pace, who had a season-high 90 tackles. ""We're going to have to come out and play our best football and we're going to have to be aggressive.""

The Jets' defense was up to the task in Atlanta.

""I think they're a good football team, they play the right way, they play hard,"" Jets coach Rex Ryan said. ""They're going to put up points. We have to go out and play like they do, give them every chance to win and do whatever we can to make them the best football team in the league.""

The Falcons (2-3) had lost five straight and three of four to the Jets before their victory in Atlanta. And Atlanta's season has been a struggle since the team acquired quarterback Mark Sanchez.

The Falcons have yet to score a touchdown in the second quarter and are averaging 21.3 points per game, the second-worst average in the NFL.

Sanchez, who was injured during the first half, was in street clothes Sunday. He threw a touchdown pass with less than two minutes left in the half, but the Jets offense has struggled since he went down.

""At the end of the day, you have to play the game, you have to play the game, and I'm not going to tell you what the game is,"" Sanchez said. ""I'm not going to tell you what I'm feeling. I'm not going to tell you what I'm thinking. I'm going to"
"Image copyright Rex Features Image caption The movie is based on the life of the Beatles manager


The movie version of The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, is to open in the US on Monday, it's been announced.

The film was made by US director Andrew Dominik and will be released in the US and UK on 23 April.

The director claims the project has now been given the go-ahead, meaning ""we expect it to open on opening weekend in both the US and UK"".

The film tells Epstein's story, which includes his relationship with John Lennon and George Harrison.

John Lennon, who died aged 40 in 1980, was among the first three to sign to the Beatles.

It also stars Nicole Kidman, who plays the Beatles' manager, and James Gandolfini, who plays Epstein's rival, Harry Palmer.

According to the director: ""The Beatles are very much a central element of the story.

""We have spent two years working on the film, but this has been quite an exciting time for everyone at Working Title and we are delighted to share it with our audience.""

According to the movie's website, it ""follows the life of one person as they build a life which takes in their family and friends, their musical career and their relationship with the people and music they love"".

In a statement given with the film, the group's management team said: ""In the film, we present two contrasting but equally complex aspects of the life of Brian Epstein - from his formative years in Liverpool and in America, to his rise in the company of his friend John Lennon to the position of manager of The Beatles.

""In every corner of the film, he is surrounded by the music which has influenced him and the people around him during the formative years of his career.

""In The Beatles, we introduce the world to a new character - the manager who would eventually become the Beatles' manager - a character who is as complex as his friends and as personal as his work.""

The US film, directed by Dominik (""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""American Hustle"") is the latest in a string of films made centred around the band.

"Newcastle are ready to make their move for Roma central midfielder Kevin Strootman after they were told Romelu Lukaku is surplus to requirements by his club.

The 25-year-old striker is one of several players to leave the Stadio Olimpico this summer and the Magpies are ready to cash in on his services.

Strootman is expected to earn £120,000 a week in Italy after moving from Stuttgart in the summer for a fee of around £10m.

Newcastle are ready to make a move for midfielder Kevin Strootman (right) after they were told Romelu Lukaku is surplus to requirements by the club

He joined the Bundesliga side on a season-long loan in August but has struggled to adjust to life at the club after being placed in the holding role ahead of team-mates to allow Lukaku to take charge of the team.

The Belgium international scored 15 goals for the German side during the 2014-15 campaign, a tally that saw them narrowly miss out on a Europa League spot.

But with Strootman unlikely to be able to match Lukaku's price tag, Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez is keen to sign a player of similar quality.

The Newcastle manager was given the all-clear not to sign any players this summer and will only be allowed five new recruits to replace those he lost at St James' Park.

Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez (centre) has been given the all-clear to sign players but the club will also be trying to offload fringe players

According to reports, Newcastle intend to let six fringe players go, but will also be trying to offload a few players who would be unable to force into the first-team after their loan spells.

And one of those is 24-year-old defender Sylvain Marveaux, who has already had loan spells at Stuttgart and Bournemouth, in his career.

Marveaux made just two Premier League appearances last season after arriving on loan at the Eastcoast club during the summer, and is said to be keen on a move to Italy, either with AC Milan or with Sampdoria.

Marveaux, (left) is tipped to be a target for AC Milan and Sampdoria, after being handed six loan breaks during his career

With Marveaux gone, Strootman is the other Newcastle player understood to be on Benitez's radar - and he won't be the only one the Spaniard has been monitoring.

The Magpies have looked at Borja Valero, who is now on his third club in four years, but Benitez wants to improve his squad rather than rely on one player to be an overnight success.

And if Benitez does end up signing another"
"I have an old desktop I've been using for a long, long time. The screen is a 1920×1200 resolution, the monitor itself is a TN monitor. My wife has a 1920×1200 monitor and she absolutely loves it, so does she have any suggestions on how to upgrade it?

She loves the monitor more than I do, but I'm going to give it a chance. If the monitor looks just a bit washed out or washed up to me, then my only advice would be to take it back and get a new one. If I end up liking it, then I may try and improve the graphics settings a bit. The older monitor still has a few settings I don't really consider to be necessary.

She is planning to replace it with a ""4k"" monitor, and I have to say this will probably be the last thing she does with it. How do I go about upgrading this old monitor?

Thanks,

The Monitor Is My Best Friend

Hi There,

We've had a few reports on this forum and on Reddit from people who have had to return high resolution monitors because the screen simply doesn't perform to their liking. If you have an older monitor and just aren't sure, it seems like a no-brainer to look into upgrading the screen because it won't be long before you have to return it and you get a new one. What we don't want you to do is look like the unlucky person on the forum after looking at your old monitor. A great place to start is by checking out the differences between the latest and the oldest video cards you could consider buying.

If you have any doubts, a good place to start would be to visit the manufacturer's website and see if you can get an opinion about the specific specifications of the screen and the specific settings it would require. If you can't get that, then just look at the actual pixel output specs provided in the specifications, which will indicate whether or not the monitor will perform well to your liking.

Now, if you think that you might love the screen, but would really prefer to go with a monitor that provides more color depth or a higher resolution, then a more powerful GPU might help. You can start researching and seeing if you can figure out if you could get a good buy, especially if your budget is limited. A lot of people that have had an older monitor go bad are the same as you on this forum with the old monitor getting washed out. The newer monitors can get cleaner.

For more help with your purchase, make sure you check out G-sync. It will reduce motion blur, reduce color shifting, and it will help a lot with moving your monitor. It will also help when your battery life is low. It can reduce your input lag as well, especially if you are doing a lot of gaming or other long-takes of a movie at once.

"What is it like to be a woman in a male-dominated industry? In this podcast we'll be talking with four women who have shared their experiences.

I have been a professional game designer for 13 years. During that time I've worked on a number of different types of games, but I've always been inspired by games that express human emotions in a unique way.

I've spent most of my career designing games that make you care about the characters and the story.

One of the things I've always loved about games as a designer is that I get to make people care about what happens to them.

In a game like XCOM: Enemy Within, the people I have to care about are the aliens, and they're constantly fighting for survival. I get to make them fight for their lives and for their families, and I get to create a world that's full of tension and danger, and I get to give them all the tools they need to survive.

In a game like HITMAN, the people I have to care about are the assassins, and they're constantly trying to kill their target. I get to make them chase their targets and to make them kill without hesitation.

In a game like Black & White, the people I have to care about are the criminals and the cops, and they're constantly trying to survive. I get to make them run, fight, and to make them be criminals and to be cops.

In a game like BioShock, the people I have to care about are the inhabitants of Rapture, and they're constantly trying to survive. I get to make them struggle, fight, and to make them fight for their lives.

These are all different types of games, but the message they all share is that the characters I'm making will fight for their lives.

The main message the games I've designed are that I get to make people care about the characters and the story. The people the characters care about are the characters I've spent the last 13 years designing for them.

I get to make people care about their characters and about the things that happen to them. I get to make people care about their families and about the things that happen to them.

I get to create a world where there is danger and tension and danger and tension, and I get to give the people in the world the tools they need to survive.

I make people care about the characters and about the stories that the stories tell.

I get to make people care about the people they're designing.

I get to make people care about the things they're creating.

I get to make people care about the people in the world that are fighting for their lives and fighting for their families.

I get to create a world where the people who are fighting for their lives and fighting for their families are constantly trying to survive.

"Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world, and for good reason: it is a powerful source of medicinal benefits. Legalization of marijuana in some states has led to a renewed interest in its therapeutic properties, with many physicians and scientists working to find the right way to utilize its benefits.

One of the most popular ways of delivering marijuana is through edibles, which consist of a liquid extract of the plant. While the patient is under the influence, the active compounds in the extract are absorbed into the bloodstream. This allows the patient to experience the therapeutic benefits of marijuana without the psychoactive effects.

Marijuana, like other pharmaceutical drugs, has to be administered by a doctor or nurse to avoid side effects. However, the legal status of edibles varies from state to state. In some states, the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes is legal, while in states like Pennsylvania, where medicinal use of marijuana is illegal, the use of edible products is prohibited.

But what about those who have to rely on illegal products? While it might sound like a solution to a problem, an article published in The New York Times Magazine recently outlined a number of cases where people have been arrested for ingesting marijuana edibles.

In Pennsylvania, the possession of an edible is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine. In New Jersey, it's a felony punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $2,500. In Hawaii, it's a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $2,500 fine.

According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Internal Medicine, the rate of marijuana use in the United States has dropped by half since the early 1990s, while the use of marijuana edibles has increased.

The article states that the reason for the rise in edibles is that they are easier to get than the plant itself, which is why many people continue to use them. It is also somewhat of a growing trend in the U.S., where edibles are now used in place of the plant itself.

While the study does not show how many patients are using edibles in the U.S., it does prove that there are people out there who are still using it to get high.

There are many medicinal benefits of marijuana, and its therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in numerous studies. The most well-known being the relief of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, as well as the spasms associated with multiple sclerosis.

The findings of the study published in JAMA Internal Medicine also indicate that marijuana can help manage pain, while reducing anxiety and improving mood.

There are many ways of consuming the plant, and a number of products are available. For example, a marijuana-infused yogurt is said to help treat chronic pain.

"The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation of the nation's largest police force.

New York police Commissioner William Bratton informed President Obama's inner circle on Wednesday that the U.S. department of justice was ""conducting an aggressive, open-ended investigation"" into the nation's largest police force

The move effectively removes the NYPD from the purview of the federal agencies that have conducted investigations into the use of force and discriminatory policing. It comes as the department is under growing scrutiny for the NYPD killings of men in recent years, including Eric Garner, Ramarley Graham, Walter Scott, Akai Gurley, Freddie Gray and others.

""We are a government of laws and not of men,"" Obama, who was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, said in the Oval Office just hours ahead of Bratton's announcement. ""And the men and women of the NYPD are out there every single day making our city safer, and more respected, and doing a great job every single day.""

In a statement, Bratton said the probe would ""examine the use of deadly force within the New York City Police Department, specifically whether use of force was objectively reasonable, the training and the qualifications of officers, the policies and customs of the department, and any policies that govern the sharing of investigative information or investigative techniques.""

The new probe is the most wide-reaching look yet at the NYPD. The president may have signaled his intention to take up the issue of police brutality when he asked for the results of a federal investigation into the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old charged with stealing a box of cigars during a confrontation with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in August 2015. That federal investigation was never conducted in the case.

President Obama, seen speaking in the Oval Office before a group of New York police officers, said that all Americans should take the time to talk to each other.

In the hours after Brown's death, some questioned his shooting but the NYPD, under Bratton, has been viewed as a model of public safety and has the highest rate of crime-fighting in the city — by far. The city's murder rate has fallen nearly 40 percent over the past 15 years.

But the police department is also heavily criticized for how it handles accusations of abuse and allegations of police misconduct, as the FBI and the US attorney's office are both probing the deaths that inspired the inquiry into the NYPD. A group of activists has demanded an inquiry.

The department has received wide acclaim over the last decade for the way it treats New Yorkers who are under investigation by the department. If an officer finds the person in custody, he will usually get a desk and office as well as a personal computer, according to a police source.

The department also has a wide array of other programs that ensure officers are not overworked or under-rewarded and encourages them to"
"""The first part is the most important—that is the part people don't notice,"" he told the Times. ""The more you think about it, the more you're going to be excited. Once that excitement kicks in, the other elements fall into place. It's really simple and natural.""

While the idea of a human-powered lunar colony might seem daunting and outlandish at first blush, the key elements needed to make it a reality are in fact very much within reach. In the past two decades alone, robotic explorers have landed on Mars, found liquid water on the surface of Jupiter's moon Europa—which, at least in the view of some researchers, may harbor life—and captured detailed images of an extremely distant lunar crater, called The South Pole-Aitken basin, in a new image release from NASA.

There's simply a lot of hardware existing across the breadth of the U.S. government that could support a human-powered expedition to the Moon—including NASA's Commercial Crew and Cargo program, which currently includes cargo resupply missions to the station being planned by Boeing and SpaceX.

The first mission that might provide the necessary financial and technical stability for such a mission, according to Nye, would be called ""Exploration Mission 1,"" an international endeavor that would have a group of astronauts landing the first astronauts on the Moon, while another group would follow up to send rovers to explore and sample the lunar environment.

To be sure, human lunar landing would require an enormous amount of government backing and funding. It would also involve an international team of engineers and astronauts. And the technical challenges associated with manned lunar exploration (a lot of it involves lunar orbital dynamics) would be particularly challenging—especially when you're talking about a mission that might last a decade—the duration of which, according to Nye, is what NASA has been considering for a manned mission to Mars for years. But, once you've got those elements in place, you might be able to build a program that could conceivably see people roving the surface of the Moon's surface, and maybe even living there a year or two.

One question, however, is whether or not the public is ready to take such an enormous step. It is a relatively new idea, the result of a technological breakthrough that we are simply beginning to understand in relation to human potential. The fact that we will be getting closer to the Moon than we ever have before—maybe more than 10,000 miles away, as the new, ultra-high resolution images show—is also a bit of a mind-bending concept on its own.

It's also worth noting that, in all these visions, there is very little talk of whether or not a lunar colony would be permanent; there is, rather, a focus on how it could contribute to humanity's future on Earth—how it could make us stronger, more resilient to climate change, and more"
"The recent news that the Toronto Maple Leafs would attempt to land the services of the New York Rangers' star centre, Rick Nash, was met with a sense of relief across the hockey world. The Rangers are out of the Western Conference playoffs, with a disappointing 7-11-2 record, and have had their agent, Pat Brisson, publicly state that the team will not be making a run at the free agent.

This is a huge relief for Nash, who has played in New York since being drafted 12th overall by the Rangers in 2003. He has been instrumental in leading the team to two Stanley Cups, both in 2013, and has a wealth of experience, having played in the league for 17 seasons.

Nash's tenure in the NHL has seen a number of highs and lows, and it's clear that this is no exception. You cannot simply compare the player to the player, because the player has changed throughout his career. Through all of this, Nash has remained loyal to the Rangers, and has played a key role in helping to build a championship culture.

""It's been a tough year for me here and the organization,"" Nash said when the trade was announced. ""I want to thank them for the opportunity as a player and a person, and now I'm looking forward to the future.""

Nash's time in New York was marked by injuries, inconsistent play and a reputation for being a player who does not love hockey. ""He's a talented player, but he can't love it,"" Islanders head coach Jack Capuano said. ""He's not going to be a loyal guy. He's going to make decisions and he's going to move on.""

He has been loyal to the Rangers, and has played a key role in building a championship culture.

As a Sabres rookie in 2004-05, Nash was a key player in the team's successful run to the Stanley Cup finals. He would go on to have a breakout season in 2005-06, leading the NHL in scoring with 61 points.

With the Sabres, Nash had an interesting season in 2006-07, playing alongside the likes of Evander Kane and Tyler Ennis. Nash's best year would come in 2008-09, when he was named to the NHL First All-Star Team. His first two seasons in New York were filled with injury, and Nash struggled with consistency, ending the season with a meager 22 points in 74 games. His best season as a Leaf was in 2011-12, when he recorded 53 points in 73 games.

Although Nash's best years came as a Leaf, he has been a major part of the Rangers dynasty in recent years. Prior to being dealt to the Rangers, Nash was a key part of the Lightning's run to the Stanley Cup finals in 2009, scoring 14 points in 18 playoff games. Nash was also a key part of the Rangers' run to the finals in 2012"

"A couple of months ago, the FBI arrested a man who was alleged to be in possession of over 200 child porn images.

Jason Edward Kelley, 30, allegedly sent the images to the FBI, and had become a ""self-styled"" ""rape-delivery service.""

The investigation, which began in March and lasted only four days, revealed that Kelley had been in possession of child porn since at least 2012. The images, which are now under a seal of secrecy, included more than 200 images of young children being raped and tortured.

The FBI said they were able to detect the images by searching a number of computers they had seized. They also found a number of chat rooms with names such as ""Kelley Express"" and ""Kelley Rapes.""

On one of the chat rooms, Kelley allegedly boasted about his illegal activities.

""I got around 300 of these and I got around 40 to 50 of them that are big ones,"" he told the chat room.

He said he got the images from a website that provided links to ""others.""

""I will not have to worry about anything like that ever again,"" he said.

"The U.S. and other countries are scrambling to respond to an increased threat of the H5N8 bird flu virus.

""The matter is under investigation,"" said Dr. David Murphy, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influenza division. ""We're working with the government of China and others to see whether there's any global source, and we're trying to determine if this is a regional or global outbreak of the bird flu.""

He added that the government is prepared to contain the virus, which has killed more than 500 people around the world.

The H5N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in 18 countries, including China, the World Health Organization said Friday.

Murray Ching, head of the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed the H5N8 bird flu virus has been detected in China, but said it is too early for a precise assessment of the impact it will have on human health.

""We don't know if it can infect humans or not,"" Ching said. ""We're just trying to understand how it spreads, how it's transmitted, how we can avoid it, and how we can respond.""

As of Friday night, the virus had infected three people in China, Ching said.

The virus is a member of the H5 family of viruses, which includes such pathogens as SARS, smallpox and HIV/AIDS. It is particularly dangerous to humans because it can be transmitted from person to person, infecting either through direct contact with infected animals or through infected poultry.

China is particularly vulnerable to the virus because the country has had a high rate of poultry infection, the WHO said.

""They are at the forefront of prevention of bird flu in China,"" Ching said. ""They have a very good surveillance system. As a country, they have improved the surveillance system.""

While the WHO has no information on how the bird flu virus spreads, experts said it is likely to spread through poultry and possibly poultry products.

""There are some kind of poultry products that are not cooked well, and the virus may be easily transmitted through raw meat,"" said John Peever, a professor of poultry science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The WHO's global influenza surveillance system is plagued by a lack of funding and capacity, Peever said, but much progress has been made, including in Asia.

""We've seen huge reductions in human numbers of H5N8 since 2006,"" he said. ""If we can get a vaccine to people before the virus gets out of control, we could be in a much better position to stop the spread of this virus.""

The WHO said the H5N8 bird flu virus can be transmitted between poultry, with the virus being spread in poultry products.

"[The following is part one of a four-part interview with Dr. Gopi K. Jain; he speaks to a variety of national and international media outlets regarding his work as chief medical officer of the World Health Organization. Part three of this series is currently underway. -- A.W.]

It may surprise you to learn how, in my opinion, the UN created its own global pandemic

Dr. Gopi K. Jain, Chief Medical Officer, WHO

I would like to begin with a bit of history – the UN's own official history of the SARS pandemic. If you look at the entire history of pandemics and the use of epidemiological science, you can be sure that the WHO was planning the SARS pandemic for quite some time since it was created back in 1977, at the UN World Health Assembly at Montreal, Canada. But the pandemic was deliberately delayed until its own scientists were able to identify the symptoms of SARS.

So, how did the WHO and WHO's global health bureaucracy do it? By simply ignoring, not researching SARS for almost 10 years for its own own benefit without ever conducting a proper epidemiological study to define the disease and its symptoms. They did this as far as we can tell because the WHO never really did a very good job of maintaining control of their own bureaucracy's budget. One such example is the fact that the WHO never did a very good job of collecting information about their own doctors, in particular, since they are under the microscope of the media and the public every time a health scare arises.

What this meant was one thing – WHO knew SARS had a disease burden but did not take proper action to control its disease. When those WHO bureaucrats were finally faced with a choice about how to respond to the pandemic, they chose not to do any epidemiological study. They could have seen that the SARS virus was indeed infectious but chose not to do any research to discover that fact at that time. Instead, they chose to act as a political body on the international stage, refusing to investigate or do even basic epidemiological studies. What this did though, is that the WHO did not have any kind of control over the disease. For instance, they did not control the medical supply and, thus, patients who caught and exposed SARS to everyone in their community. The epidemic spread exponentially, from a few hundred cases to thousands of cases per day in less than 6 months and then suddenly the WHO was forced to act…and with utter disregard of the facts.

Now, since most of these people have been in the public spotlight lately, the WHO decided that they must act and do some basic epidemiological study. What have they discovered? Now with more information now emerging about the SARS virus, the WHO can be reasonably certain that SARS is indeed a new pathogen that is causing massive epidemic diseases worldwide. Yet, they have"

Carolina Panthers players are getting a crash course in a new and complicated scheme under new head coach Ron Rivera. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)

The Philadelphia Eagles and Carolina Panthers have agreed to a trade for center Ryan Kalil, according to the official Twitter account of the team's website today. A deal was not final, but the Eagles were hoping to complete the deal early Thursday morning.

ESPN's Ed Werder has a story on the trade up to pick up Kalil and how the Panthers plan to use him. Here's Werder's take on the details of the deal:

What's on the table? The Eagles will receive a first round pick, a conditional third round pick and a fourth round pick, Nos. 57 and 78, depending upon how the final two trading periods go.

The Panthers get the Eagles' second-round pick from the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons traded the pick from the Philadelphia Eagles to Arizona, then got what was then their second-round pick, No. 30, to move up and get it from the Panthers.

What does it mean? That's up to you. That third-round pick is a pick that the Eagles could have a chance at picking up next year, and the Cardinals' third-round pick is likely to come back in 2018, although there is at least a possibility that it comes back right now because the Cardinals didn't have it this year.

There are a lot of moving pieces here, so I haven't pulled any cards from my hat (which I have no right to do). All I know is that the Eagles should be happy that they've gotten Kalil, although it may cost them a draft pick next year. He was a player they really wanted when they got him.

I think we all know that Kalil makes our list of the ten best tackles in the NFL, especially with the way he has started to play in Carolina. The Panthers could use some help on their offensive line, and if Carolina's new offensive line coach, Jeff Davidson, is willing to move up and get Kalil, we'll be happy for him.

"The number of people who have died in river infestations in the past five years is much higher than previously thought, according to a new study.

While the number of people who have drowned in river water is down from about 11,000 in 2008 to about 6,000 currently, the new study based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that the number of people who have died from drowning in rivers and streams has dramatically increased.

On average, the number of deaths from drowning in the United States each year in the past five years has been about 2,900, the study shows. But that number is up to nearly 10,000 people, according to the new study.

The new study was based on data from the National Weather Service and the National Centers for Environmental Information. The data showed that the number of people who have died from drowning in rivers and streams increased about 25 percent between 2008 and 2012. The most recent year for which data is available, 2012, saw a spurt in drowning deaths as well.

The study also shows that the number of deaths from drowning in rivers and streams increased by more than 20 percent between 2007 and 2012.

The report from the EPA, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, says the increase in drowning deaths is ""consistent with a growing concern about the risks of water quality in the United States.""

The report notes that the increase in deaths could be due to a variety of factors, including the fact that some states have implemented rules that require more frequent testing of water quality.

And the report says that the water quality of rivers and streams is also getting worse as the runoff from forests and farms into rivers and streams is increasing.

Other studies have shown that excessive amounts of pollutants in rivers and streams can lead to increased levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and other pollutants that can harm human health.

The EPA says that the findings of this study ""suggest that the human health risks from water quality and the beneficial impacts of water quality are not necessarily independent.""

""The human health risk from water quality is not necessarily independent of the beneficial impacts of water quality,"" said EPA's Dr. William Atwood. ""Water quality has the potential to affect the health of people in many ways, from the nutrient content of water to the quality of the water itself.... This study shows that the public health risks of water quality are likely to be greater than the benefits of water quality. This highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to water quality and its human health impacts.""

A 2012 study of more than 34,000 people in six states found that the risk of illness from drinking water contaminated with fecal bacteria was 50 percent higher than the risk of illness from drinking contaminated water that did not have fecal bacteria.

I didn't have any coconut flour, so I used almond flour instead, and that turned out just as good. I'm not sure why I haven't used any other flour in a recipe before, but I'm not going to stop now!

You will need some leftover lentil, a few cups of water, and some cornmeal. I used a can of lentils and one can of cornmeal. If you don't have them, you can use the leftovers of any kind of cooked lentils, or you can use a quart of water. A little salt would be nice, but I didn't bother. I added a little garlic powder to the lentil mixture, but it was not necessary.

I have to admit, it was a little strange at first to have the lentils in the water, but it is delicious. I used a brand new rice cooker, so I am sure it would work with any type of cooker. I think it will also work with any kind of new potatoes, but I didn't try. You will need to leave the pot on low for 8 hours, but I didn't have to. The rice will cook a little longer, so that is good.

I served this with a quick salad and some grilled chicken breast. It was pretty good! I don't know why, but after I made it, I couldn't help but eat more. I'm sure it will be delicious again at some point."

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) ranks natural gas as the fifth most abundant fossil fuel in the United States, behind oil, coal, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Natural gas can also be produced from coal, which is the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States, and from petroleum, which is the most abundant fossil fuel in the world.

Natural gas production is concentrated in two regions of the United States, the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. In the Marcellus, natural gas production accounts for approximately a third of total U.S. natural gas production, approximately 9 percent of total U.S. oil production, and about 4 percent of total U.S. oil production. In the Utica shale, natural gas production accounts for approximately a quarter of total U.S. natural gas production, approximately 8 percent of total U.S. oil production, and about 3 percent of total U.S. oil production.

The Marcellus and Utica shale plays have experienced a steady increase in production, with total U.S. natural gas production increasing from approximately 3.8 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2005 to approximately 5.1 trillion Tcf in 2015.

The two shale plays experienced a similar time lag in their production of natural gas compared with other U.S. fossil fuels supply. Natural gas production from the Marcellus shale started in 1989 and was fully developed in 2003, while production from the Utica shale started in the 1970s and was fully developed in 2005. Natural gas production from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays started to increase at roughly the same time as U.S. oil production increased from 3.2 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2005 to 3.9 million bbl/d in 2015.

Since 2009, U.S. natural gas production has increased approximately 21 percent, from 5.1 trillion Tcf in 2009 to 6.6 trillion Tcf in 2015. The increase in natural gas production has been accompanied by an increase in natural gas prices. From 2009 to 2015, average natural gas prices have increased approximately 71 percent from a low of $1.68/MMBtu in 2013 to $4.43/MMBtu in 2015.

"The following article is taken from The Art of Learning: How to Develop a Winning Mindset and Get Ahead, and it can be found in the Winter 2012 edition of Psychology Today - The Ultimate Resource.

As a matter of fact, it's a matter of life and death for most of us. Most everyone on average will need a degree in psychology for as long as they have a job, and for many years afterwards. And most of us won't get a degree from a state university unless the degree is worth more than our first-year salary, which isn't going to be that high—and that means that one of the only ways we can afford it is by getting a graduate psychology degree from an established professional university.

But what's the problem? Why are so many students flummoxed after they land an unadvertised graduate program only to lose ground to other students, after they receive an offer and get accepted? Why bother going through all this hoop-jumping at all if it's going to be so fruitless?

The answer is that getting a graduate degree from an unaccredited college or university is like trying to climb a mountain on bare feet—you can't make it, you can't do it, even if you try so hard that your boots start to fall off after a while. There's no excuse.

But what is an accredited college or university? It's a university in good standing, which means that (depending on their state) they're able to grant degrees that are recognized by most professional organizations, such as the American Psychology Association (formerly the APA), and the Council on Education for the Foreign Service (CEFS).

If any institution isn't in good standing now, they will be in the future—when they're being sued by the government for the way they've handled hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraud by students. As far as accrediting organizations go, they're pretty tough.

But accredited or not, the fact remains that a college or university is not in good standing when it offers an unaccredited degree, including a graduate course in psychology, for students to take. The American Psychological Association discourages the practice of giving any kind of unaccredited degree to students as an option. It's illegal!


What's wrong with an unaccredited psychology graduate program?

Unaccredited degrees in psychology are of little use to most students (except, maybe, to the lawyers who sometimes specialize in these fields), because it isn't possible to get a professional accreditation of a college or university in psychology. You can't go into the American Psychological Association or the Council on Education for the Foreign Service and give them a master's or PhD in psychology. You can't get into the American Psychological Association.

A graduate degree in psychology is basically just a college degree in psychology. It tells you not only about your ability as a person but also about"

"(Washington, DC) – House Republicans continue to pursue an agenda to repeal the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare""). After their long-promised ""fix"" failed on May 4, the House took a number of steps in furtherance of this agenda that will hurt patients and taxpayers, and will do nothing to protect the well-being of the millions of people who now have health insurance.

The Trump administration should move quickly to advance the long-overdue effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with commonsense reform.

To that end, the Trump administration should immediately make the following changes in its proposed rule for how health insurers can offer plans that may lack essential health benefits and cost less in premiums to consumers: (1) immediately repeal the rule at issue here and in cases where the same rule applies; (2) suspend the new rule for a year; (3) re-issue the prior rule with appropriate fixes; and (4) suspend the rule pending action by the agency.

This approach will provide clarity for insurers and insurance providers to provide coverage that meets the essential health benefit requirements of the ACA, improve access to high-quality care, and provide incentives for all health insurers to compete fairly and provide coverage in the individual and small group markets.

The Trump administration should immediately take four more steps. First, while they have yet to identify a replacement that meets the key promises of the ACA or will reduce the number of Americans without coverage, the Trump administration should immediately create a new, more comprehensive approach to health care reform by: (1) establishing a Task Force to Assist States in Ensuring Access to High Quality Coverage and Improving Adequate Access to Care; (2) issuing a report to Congress on how states are making progress in ensuring adequate coverage and quality care and identifying areas with high unmet need; (3) issuing a report to Congress analyzing the current state of health insurance coverage and identifying legislative actions that could ensure adequate coverage; and (4) issuing a report to Congress describing the progress made by states in implementing recommendations from the 2015 Surgeon General's report.

Additionally, this Administration should:

(1) rescind the Rule issued last year that would have placed unnecessary burdens on the insurance industry;

(2) revoke the regulation, issued by the Bureau of Consumer Protection (""BCP""), in 2016 that would have required insurers to provide all of the following benefits in one policy – including maternity coverage, newborn care, mental health and substance abuse support, chronic disease management, emergency care, disability services, prescription drug benefits, dental benefits and vision, on products and policies sold in all 50 states;

(3) repeal the rule, issued by the BIP in 2016, which would have required insurers to charge higher premiums to certain consumers with pre-existing medical conditions;

(4) issue an executive order directing the Department of Justice and all other agencies to vigorously defend state laws and"

"DARPA's new brain-computer interface (BCI) software has enabled the first fully paralyzed person to control an Xbox gamepad using nothing but thought, according to researchers at the US military research agency.

The research, published in the journal eLife, involved four experiments that allowed the team to measure and analyze neural activity in the brain during various tasks carried out with the device – a brain implant, an external device, or some combination of the two.

In one experiment, known as an 'acoustic probe,' which was also carried out with a full, functional brain implant, the participants used their thoughts to control the computer's cursor. This allowed them to move in the virtual world – albeit with fairly limited success.

A second experiment involved simply giving the participant instructions via the gamepad's built-in controls. If the control was completed successfully (in which case the system was considered a success), the participant was then encouraged to try something else, like trying again with the gamepad instead of the computer.

Another experiment focused on the task of using a thought to control specific muscles, a task known as the'mirror neuron task.' The participant was asked to attempt to control a specific area of the body with their brain, such as their arm. In one demonstration of the task, the participant saw a green dot with a red target on either side of it. If they could successfully control the red dot with their brain, the green dot would disappear.

Although the experiment focused on mental control, another experiment focused on spinal reflexes, the ability for a spinal limb to respond when commanded. In one demonstration a participant was asked to perform the task of moving their leg into the correct position as an indication of whether or not the leg was being placed correctly in its socket.

The results of the research – presented at the ACM-IEEE Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Honolulu, Hawaii – showed that the BCI had proved ""reliable and reproducible"" and was ""effective and safe.""

""The implantable BCI device enabled the study of a small population of individuals for whom brain-computer interfaces are an appropriate therapy for restoring voluntary control of non-dominant non-spinal limbs,"" the researchers wrote.

The researchers added that they have not yet carried out experiments with those that use brain implants but that the technology ""should be possible for us to do within the next few years based on current technology."""
"(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine who helped capture a Jordanian pilot held hostage by ISIS was killed in a roadside bombing targeting U.S. troops in Iraq, a U.S. Central Command spokesman said Sunday.

The U.S. military official said Col. James R. Conway Jr. was a Marine sergeant based in the area of Fallujah near Baghdad. The official didn't disclose the precise location of the explosion and called that information ""a nonpublic"" matter.

The bombing came two days after a suicide bomber targeted a group of American contractors operating with Iraqi security forces near Fallujah. No Americans were injured in either incident.

The militants released an audio message Saturday declaring a ""caliphate"" in the ISIS-held area east of Fallujah, also known as Ramadi.

The ISIS video showed the burning alive of the Jordanian pilot named U.S. hostage Muadh al Kasasbeh, whom ISIS threatened to use for its propaganda purposes.

CNN has confirmed that Kasasbeh was captured in December when ISIS militants overran a Jordanian military base near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. He was forced to make a public televised confession for the extremist group.

The militants later released video footage featuring photos of Kasasbeh as well as one of Kasasbeh's decapitated head in flames.

ISIS released a second video showing a Jordanian pilot it threatened to kill.

The video purports to be the pilot's confession. It shows him kneeling in the desert and saying, ""I swear by Allah that if Jordan falls, we will slaughter you, all of you.""

His captors demand that he be traded ""like an ordinary prisoner of war,"" but the pilot refuses, telling the militants that he is an Islamic hero. The video ends with ISIS fighters firing upon the captive Jordanian pilot.

The Jordanian government asked the United States to provide a formal ransom, but it has declined to offer any. CNN is not reporting the exact amount of the payment or what will happen if there is no money forthcoming.

The U.S. military issued statements saying that it is aware that the pilot's family has asked the United States not to trade him or release the video, but it remains willing to take steps to make sure the Jordanians are treated fairly and safely.

""We will continue to discuss with the government (in Jordan) how the Jordanian government can help ensure the safe release of our citizen. We expect them to pursue every option to ensure the safety of our hostages and their families,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.

On Saturday, ISIS released photos and video of an exchange of prisoners. The militants released the Jordanian pilot in exchange for the hostage U.S. Marine, Lt. Hadar Goldin, an Israeli citizen, the militants told CNN.

But the captives appear to be in very poor health, the militants"

"It's become so common to be told that the media is an entity unto itself that it's no longer a question of if, rather, when a story will break about the lack of coverage the media gives to some of the most important and meaningful topics in the world. For those who aren't familiar with the term, I'll explain: When mainstream media (MSM) is discussing an important issue of national importance, we might hear the phrase, ""it's just one story."" When discussing another issue, we might hear, ""it's just one issue."" When discussing another issue or even one issue that's not important, we sometimes hear the phrase, ""there are many issues at play here."" Here's the thing: In the minds of politicians and even many in the media, just reporting one issue (i.e., gun violence) for the sake of reporting only one issue (i.e., gun violence) is somehow the equivalent of not covering the important issues, especially when the other issues are so often in the spotlight. It's so widely accepted that it even seems to be an article of faith among many in the media to pretend that the press ignores gun violence (and, by extension, all issues), even after news organizations like The New York Times and The Washington Post actually did just that. We are regularly bombarded with phrases like, ""in the eyes of many, just one news outlet has reported that,"" ""just one day of news coverage"" on any given tragedy involving the killing of a person by gun violence, or the oft-heard, ""I just didn't see it on cable news or Twitter,"" or even, ""if I missed this story, you probably didn't either,"" implying that somehow news organizations ignore an issue because they're not interested…

The most recent example of this can be seen in an interview between Chuck Todd of NBC News and Hillary Clinton, hosted by MSNBC's Chris Hayes. (Watch for yourself: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4)

From the Huffington Post:

During a Wednesday night interview, Chuck Todd noted that President Barack Obama hadn't spoken publicly about gun control since Friday's shooting, which left at least nine people dead, including the perpetrator. ""The president did not have a press conference the day after the shooting, despite what we would hope would be some extraordinary and very serious attention being given to this issue,"" Todd noted.

And again, in an earlier exchange with Hillary Clinton, Chuck Todd even suggested that the president had ignored the shooting in order to continue campaigning for the November election:

""Do you think the president was intentionally avoiding talking about this issue in order to get out ahead of it?"" Todd asked. ""The president didn't start on Thursday.""

And on Twitter, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg tweeted:

But no one believes a news organization ignores the issue to provide the media with a constant stream of stories about what the media"

"It's the American dream, you get to live in the country of your dreams! You move to an island with all the big city stuff and you can go to college, get a great job, and start life on the right foot. Well, that's what some people say. In reality, a lot of people are moving to the island of their dreams and the island of their mistakes.

Truth is that most people who are thinking about moving to an island are moving to an island because the island offered too many of the wrong things.

A lot of people move to an island because they are looking for ""experiences."" Some people just want to escape some of the pain in their lives. They want to ""live a life"" on the island. Some people just want to live in a place where they can finally relax and have fun, and they don't want to deal with the city. Or, they just want to escape from the stresses of life.

"A few weeks ago an Australian woman named Jennifer Cramer took a selfie in front of a photo display in an Adelaide mall. She was trying to demonstrate how the photo format has changed, how her old picture would be taken now if she were in front of a digital display. The display took a video of her, which is why it looks the way it does. That's because the photo sensor took a short video of what happened.

""It made a video of me walking around and then the mall did the same thing with some lighting effects,"" Cramer said. ""It's almost like there were two people in this picture. And the lighting was not very good – you can clearly see my black skirt.""

Cramer is now claiming the photo display and video copyright violation, and she has already had a phone company remove all the video off their servers. Cramer is also taking a video showing that the camera was clearly operating as a video camera, which they are ignoring.

Cramer said she felt more at-risk if she was holding her phone up in front of the photo display than if she was to snap a photo of the display itself, because the photo display was so much closer.

I want this.

Jennifer Cramer

""It was so difficult to walk in front of it. I was looking back over my shoulder,"" she said.

Cramer's story echoes the story of Aaron David Kayyem, who was a journalist at Gizmodo when Samsung pulled its Galaxy Note 7 from the market earlier this year. Kayyem says he was standing in front of a Samsung Display video panel, holding his phone up so it was in front of it, when a coworker told him ""Oh, he dropped it."" After a quick phone review, Samsung issued a recall.

Cramer's case, however, raises a number of issues. First off, because this video display was so big and so close, it's not possible to say exactly what happened. Cramer doesn't say if she was holding the phone in front of it — but if she wasn't, when was she holding it? Also, the photo display is clearly working as a video camera — there's no way it's not. Cramer's lawyers argue that both the image sensor and the display are doing the same thing to her photo before uploading it to a server.

In all, this has the makings of a classic DMCA lawsuit: the plaintiff doesn't want the accused infringing on their copyright (which should have been obvious in this case), but rather wants to use the DMCA case as a mechanism to get Samsung to remove any and all links to the video-on-display. For that reason, Cramer's case could be far juicier — perhaps it will become part of the public domain, thanks to a ruling from the 9th Circuit before it's even decided.

"Two weeks ago, I published a list of some of the best of the year's best RPGs. Since then, I've been looking for new places to read and play. I'm now happy to report that I've found the perfect fit.

My local Game Store, The Game Shoppe, has a wide selection of board games for both casual and competitive play. I'm a big fan of classic European board games, so I jumped at the chance to try out a game called Legend of the Five Rings. I'd heard good things about it from a few of my friends, so I ended up spending the weekend playing it with my group.

Legend of the Five Rings is a simplified take on the classic Chinese game of Go. Instead of playing as a player, you play as a ""Gong"" your opponent plays as a ""Peng"". The game is played in long, continuous turn-based battles between two players vying for control of the four corners of the board. The game doesn't have a lot of sophisticated rules, but it does offer up a unique, spooky, and humorous take on Go.

Since it was my first time playing Legend of the Five Rings, I brought along a copy of the game to help with my first couple of games. I was surprised to find it a lot more fun than my standard go-go-go game. The game does take some getting used to, but after I gave it a shot, I was hooked. It's a simple concept, with many interesting options for how you can play.

The game has a bit of a learning curve, with a few rules and options to learn. I'd recommend starting with one of the base games in the ""Legend of the Five Rings"" set, or one of the ""Gong"" set, as it's the easiest to play. The game is a lot of fun to play, so it makes a great first game to introduce new players to the genre.

I'd recommend Legend of the Five Rings to any fan of board games, zombie apocalypse, or any other board game that has a bit of weirdness to it. If you haven't tried it out yet, I'd recommend picking up a copy of the game and giving it a shot."

The fiscal deficit for the year to March 31, 2016, stood at 5.1 per cent of GDP.

The fiscal deficit for the year to March 31, 2015, stood at 9.9 per cent of GDP, but was due to a decrease in tax revenues from an increase in international oil prices.

The deficit for the year to March 31, 2014, stood at 7.7 per cent of GDP.

The fiscal deficit is a broad measure of the gap between the money government spends and the money it receives in the form of taxes. The government's revenue, though, excludes the money it spends on such things as social welfare, health and education.

The total deficit for the year to March 31, 2016, was higher than the previous year's deficit of 3.2 per cent, mainly due to the growth in the fiscal deficit, but the rise was less than the 7.1 per cent expected by analysts.

The government's fiscal deficit in the year ended June 30, 2015, was at 5.1 per cent of GDP.

In the financial year to March 31, 2016, the fiscal deficit was 4.3 per cent of GDP.

The government's deficit in the year ended June 30, 2014, was 6.6 per cent of GDP.

The government's deficit in the year ended June 30, 2013, was 7.1 per cent of GDP.

The government's deficit in the year ended June 30, 2012, was 9.1 per cent of GDP.

The government's deficit in the year ended June 30, 2011, was 7.1 per cent of GDP.

The government's deficit in the year ended June 30, 2010, was 7.7 per cent of GDP.

"Cape Town - South African authorities have arrested an employee of the national carrier Afriqiyah Airways accused of using a fraudulent licence to board a flight from Amsterdam to Johannesburg with a backpack containing more than €200,000 ($244,000).

The Afriqiyah employee was identified by NTV, an English-language broadcaster, as 24-year-old Ali al-Shabibi, who was brought into custody while in Amsterdam, where he was working. He is suspected of a second fraud involving the issuance of two fake passports.


""It has now been proven that the passenger in question was allowed to board a flight on the false passport of an Afriqiyah employee,"" the national police spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi told journalists in Johannesburg.


The arrest comes after the police in South Africa found more than €3 million ($3.5 million) in cash in a suitcase left at the Schiphol airport on 8 December.

He was among the passengers that police had originally been looking for on the flight after they had taken possession of the suitcase.


There was a high alert with the aircraft diverted to Amsterdam and the four passengers put on a flight back to Johannesburg.

The passport-for-cash scam was first reported earlier this month, when the police were alerted to the bag at the Schiphol airport. The suitcase had been sent back to Amsterdam on 7 December.

The police investigation revealed that the case involved fraud within the Afriqiyah Airways office in Antwerp where Ali reportedly worked as a security employee. He had also previously applied to work at another company in South Africa.


He was arrested two days later outside the Amsterdam airport on 14 December and his passport and belongings were released a day later. He later flew to South Africa.


Ali is thought to have been working at the company since 2012.

Solutions for fraudulent use of foreign passports

The South African police said in a press release that Ali had used two passports to board a flight to Johannesburg on 20 November 2015 under the names of Mohammed Ahmad al-Ali and Mohammed Ahmed Ali.

He then booked himself on a flight back to Amsterdam and was picked up on the plane.

The police said he was later arrested with $3.5 million in cash and a suitcase, which was left at Schiphol airport on 12 December.

""This investigation is still ongoing and we have a lot more questions to ask and answers to provide regarding these fraudulent schemes,"" Mulaudzi said.

""If anyone has any suspicions as to where or how that money came to be in that suitcase that was left at the airport, we ask you to contact the police."""
"For one thing, the only known case of a man being hurt by a TSA agent was a minor case of carpal tunnel syndrome.

And for another, despite the fact that a pilot reported that he was kicked, punched, bitten and was even restrained at the hands and feet by TSA agents, the agency has denied that he was ever in any danger at all.

In fact, the TSA says it's the pilot, not the agents, who committed the ""crimes.""

This is not the first time a pilot has allegedly been harmed by the TSA. In May, a woman died when an agent allegedly kicked her in the chest, chest and back after she ""refused to remove her shoes.""

The TSA has also been accused of kicking a man in the ribs and hands in 2010. After the man ""refused to remove his shoes,"" and was taken to the airport, an agent allegedly kicked him in the ribs and stomach, according to the Freedom of Information Act.

The TSA has denied all of these allegations.

""I can assure you that the actions of the agents involved in this incident were not part of any policy,"" said TSA Spokeswoman Lorie Dankers.

The TSA does say that the agents involved have been put on administrative leave, pending the outcome of an investigation.

The Huffington Post also notes that just as the TSA is denying the pilot was ever in any danger at all, it charges that the pilot was acting ""erratically"" and ""deliberately refused to follow the screening procedures.""

The TSA says the pilot was being ""deliberately disruptive,"" and the male passenger, who was ""inattentive to the screening procedures,"" was ""upset"" and ""yelling and cursing."""
"I get a lot of questions about building a Raspberry Pi case. Most of them come with the following assumptions –

Raspberry Pi is in use with it's battery connected (battery plugged into the GPIO pins) and

The Pi is in it's power cycle (running)

I have a very simple case model in mind, which isn't really an Arduino (which is the other popular solution)

Which is fine, but what to do if the Pi is not in power cycle and you want a case to put your project in? My aim is to make a minimal PCB which will allow you to attach a Pi without any modification to your project.


Case design – Part 1

Before anything, let me describe the case itself in details.

The PCB you will receive in a case will be identical to the ones we have produced so far. We just make sure the dimensions are the same. It isn't a huge deal, most of the time you just use another case PCB and solder the connections for your project from there.

When I designed the case model I kept the following assumptions in mind –

Raspberry Pi is running with battery connected.

The Pi's power is not running in a constant loop. Instead, the power cycle happens on every few seconds (see above for more details).

That being said, here is the board layout I ended up with. It shows all the connections I designed in case modelling software, but is not ready for PCB manufacturing. I may eventually design the board layout by hand if the demand is high enough and I have the time to do it (I also have a spare slot for a 1.8mm pitch PCB that I might sell to support my further work in this area, so that is something to consider for the future – I will do the PCB design in this post).

Raspberry Pi PCB layout

If you do not want to model the board layout by hand you will also need 1.2mm pitch PCB.

The PCB should have 4mm pads for headers (I will be using 10k resistors), I recommend the following for the first PCB design –

These headers are very cheap and do the trick. You just solder them in place using the correct solder paste, this will help you to avoid any shorting of the Pi's connectors when soldering them. I used solder to make my first soldering attempt, but you may find solder or a better alternative to match the PCB's resistors.

Board layout

We had to move the PCB layout to an SD card. I used to have a 4Gb flash card (that failed miserably), but I ended up using two SD cards per case design for two reasons –

First of all, one of the cards had a problem with the Pi and the other had no problem, so we ended up with two sets of cards in each case."
"Concept art of the P4X-003 Qubeley and its Qubeley-esque weapons.

The P4X-003 Qubiely is a Mobile Suit from the original series.

Contents show]

Technology & Combat Characteristics

The P4X-003 Qubiely is based on the Qubeley-esque Qubeley-like Mobile Suit. It is equipped with a Saber, a beam rifle, a beam cannon and a beam shield. The Qubeley-like Mobile Suit was made to fight on the battlefield with the Qubeley-esque weapons and equipment.

Armaments

Saber A beam saber is a small cylindrical device held in the mobile suit's hands when operated and is powered by a rechargeable energy capacitor. It emits a blade of plasma contained by an I-Field which can cut through any metal that has not been treated with anti-beam coating.

Beam Cannons A pair of beam cannons are mounted on the side of the suit's torso. The cannons are then stored in the main body and fired as a pair of beam sabers.

Shield A shield is a compact defensive armament that can be stored on the mobile suit's back when not in use and is powered by a rechargeable energy capacitor.

Beam Cannon A beam cannon is a long-range weapon that fires a projectile filled with plasma and is capable of destroying a mobile suit from long range.

Special Equipment & Features

Dimension Shift Capability The Qubeley-like Mobile Suit can use Dimension Shift to change between dimensions.

History

The P4X-003 Qubiely was designed by the Earth Alliance to be a weapon against the Titans. The unit was first deployed on the planet Ganymede before being assigned to the AEUG's Counter-Terrorist Unit under Aida Kotobuki. It was later deployed on the planet Jaburo.

During the Gryps Conflict, the P4X-003 Qubiely was deployed to the skies of Jaburo to defend against the Titans. The team eventually lost its many members to the Titans.

"As a freelancer, you have to choose the right tools and the right software for your business.

Here are four tools to keep in mind while choosing between the best and the worst freelancing tools:

1. Create a plan with your client

The most important decision you can make is to have a clear plan of action that will help you to grow over time. With that, you have to be able to think logically and identify the different stages of your client's project.

For example, if a client wants to have a prototype for his or her new product, you should have a clear idea of what the products look like to the clients.

If a client wants to sell your services as a freelancer, you can have a detailed plan of your services.

2. Write a state of the art marketing plan

A marketing plan will help you to understand how to market your services, and also help you to create a strategy for your freelancing career.

Freelancing marketing plans are usually made up of a number of different sections and sub-sections.

These sections and sub-sections should be:

The topic of the marketing plan – What is the topic you want to discuss?

– What is the topic you want to discuss? The scope of the marketing plan – How much time you will dedicate to marketing your services?

– How much time you will dedicate to marketing your services? How to market your services – How to market your services?

– How to market your services? The marketing plan itself – How to market your services.

– How to market your services. How to reach potential clients – How to reach potential clients.

– How to reach potential clients. How to increase your income – How to increase your income.

– How to increase your income. How to get clients – How to get clients.

3. Get your value proposition ready

Your value proposition is your value proposition.

Your value proposition is whatever your clients see in all of your content, your videos, your videos, your ebooks, your articles, your blog posts, your testimonials, your social media profiles, your website, etc.

You don't have to make a value proposition, but make sure you create one so that you can clearly explain what you do and why your services are valuable.

4. Do your research

You have to research your competition to make sure you're not not doing something you don't want to do.

The best way to research your competition is to do a thorough search of the internet, and also to do a comprehensive Google search.

Don't make the mistake of just doing a Google search but also do a Google Analytics search.

When you see that your competitors are doing something similar to what you're doing, you'll be able to give them a good"

"The New York Times editorial board has criticized President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement.

The board's column Wednesday asserted that the U.S. would be better off without the agreement, noting that it has cost the U.S. economy $3.2 billion and that the agreement would harm American workers.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Trump administration announced earlier this month that the U.S. would quit the Paris climate agreement, prompting criticism from foreign leaders and business interests.

The board did not mention Trump by name but called the decision a ""distraction"" from the larger issue of ""what America's role in the world should be.""

""Trump's decision to exit the Paris climate accord is the latest in a series of missteps that has distracted from the underlying problem of America's role in the world,"" the editorial board wrote.

""The Paris accord was a bad deal for the United States, costing us tens of billions of dollars in lost taxes and some 3.2 million jobs, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And Trump has taken steps to undermine the United States' role in the Paris accord, so it is stunning that he is now embracing the accord's terms.""

It added that the U.S. has ""no place at the Paris climate conference, where the economic costs to the United States will be far greater than the benefits.""

""The Paris accord is not about the environment, but about power. It is a bad deal for the United States, costing us tens of billions of dollars in lost taxes and some 3.2 million jobs, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And Trump has taken steps to undermine the United States' role in the Paris accord, so it is stunning that he is now embracing the accord's terms.""

Trump has argued that the Paris accord would hurt the U.S. economy and has said it would cost the country 3.2 million jobs by 2025.

Earlier this month, former President Obama Barack Hussein ObamaThe Texas Senate race should frighten the Republican Party The politics of not talking about Trump Trump tariffs, trade war make us less able to weather another recession MORE invited the leaders of almost 200 countries to a climate change summit in Paris, where they discussed the issue."
"The Pentagon says the US has seen no sign of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine and is searching for any signs of a Russian military buildup.

The United States also dismissed as ""speculation"" Russian President Vladimir Putin's suggestion that Russian forces in the region might be guarding Russian-speaking citizens.

US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says he hopes the situation will be resolved peacefully.

Ukraine's pro-Western government says about 30 Russian soldiers have been killed since a pro-Russian uprising began in February.

The Russian military says it has no troops in Ukraine."
"The ""death to all enemies"" mantra is a well-established theme in the fighting game community. The motto is especially popular in the fighting game community because this is the fighting game community.

In the world of fighting games, ""death to all enemies"" is a term used by many fighting game players to refer to finishing all opponents with a single move or attack.

The players who start out with ""death to all enemies"" as a mindset quickly give up on the idea when they realize that it is actually impossible. Since there are many other factors that can occur in this competitive environment, it is just not possible for every player to be able to finish all opponents with a single move.

On the other hand, there are players who place ""death to all enemies"" as a prime objective. These players believe they can win any fight by being the last one standing, no matter the opponent.

While these two different strategies might not occur in every match, there are still many players who play with ""death to all enemies.""

Still, how does one know which type of players are more common in the fighting game community?

I decided to find out by following some of the most popular characters and analyzing their playstyles, pre- and post-death to all enemies.

Pre-Death to All Enemies

The most notable character in the fighting game community who has the mindset of ""death to all enemies"" is Yun.

The character is known for his character-specific combos and for his ability to utilize the environment to his advantage. He can teleport, hover above the ground to avoid attacks, and even float above the ground and launch Kazuya's attack.

In addition, Yun has a variety of other playstyles that can be utilized by the character. He can use a jumping combo to launch himself into the air, he can perform a long-distance jump cancel jump slash to avoid attacks, and he can perform a long-range forward-dash cancel to avoid a combo.

Even though Yun is a character that is known for his death to all enemies mindset, he also has a large pool of other playstyles that he can utilize.

Post-Death to All Enemies

While Yun's main playstyle is death to all enemies, all characters in the game have some sort of post-death mentality.

As mentioned above, Yun is one of the characters that has the mentality of ""death to all enemies.""

Likewise, most characters in the fighting game community have some sort of post-death mentality. Some of these characters include Chun-Li, Rufus, Blanka, and Cody.

Chun-Li has a post-death mindset for the most part, as she is primarily balanced around being able to kill her opponents with a single strike. This mentality is similar to Yun's mindset; it is her primary way of winning.

"What was once known as the world's largest and most powerful nuclear arsenal has been reduced to 1,000 weapons, a fraction of what the United States once had.

The United States is now down to just 7,600 warheads, a reduction that has come about thanks to an aggressive reduction program of old, aging weapons. A new and more aggressive arsenal has been put in place, but the US remains the world's number one nuclear power.

On a recent trip to a US military base in Arizona, I was able to see a few US nuclear weapons up close (the pictures above were provided by the base).

The weapons include ""hot and hard"" warheads that are capable of penetrating any armor. These weapons are also equipped with the world's two most powerful nuclear bombs ever deployed, named ""Death Star"" and ""Hibana.""

""The only place that the Death Star can be deployed is in another country's territory,"" a retired senior officer told me. ""The purpose of the Death Star is to destroy another country's infrastructure and kill as many people as possible.""

The second-most powerful nuclear weapons in the US arsenal, dubbed ""Mk-41,"" were launched from the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. These weapons had the intended effect of crippling North Korea. They have been replaced by a more powerful missile, named ""Tomahawk"".

There's no way of knowing how long these weapons will remain. Some are scheduled to be removed in the next twenty years, and one-third will be removed by 2049. The rest will likely be retired by the end of the century.

The Obama administration has made a concerted effort to reduce the US number of nuclear weapons while at the same time ratcheting up the threat that they will use these weapons.

President Obama, as well as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, made statements on the nuclear threat during their Presidential campaigns, even if it was only at the end of July.

At the last moment, it was reported that Donald Trump had changed his position. The report states that Trump had said during an interview that the US could never withdraw its weapons from Germany. Trump has not yet commented on the issue."
"BENCHTOWN – A Benoit woman found guilty of killing her newborn son as well as giving the infant to a former boyfriend was sentenced to five years in prison today.

Laura Marie Hulshoff told Judge Mary Lou Bremner during her sentencing hearing for the murder conviction of her former husband and father of her two daughters that she took the blame for her crimes ""because it was for me to make the decision I did.""

Bremner also asked Hulshoff, 33, how she expected to live when she's behind bars.

Hulshoff said she thought about killing herself when she heard that her former husband, Steven Hulshoff, 31, was now an alcoholic.

Before taking the stand, Hulshoff said she was sorry to God, her family and the State of Maine.

""God spared me from all sorts of misery and misery I went through,"" said Hulshoff.

But Hulshoff insisted her guilty verdict is not just because her former husband was an alcoholic. In fact, it may be the ""biggest regret"" and the ""biggest failure"" of her life.

Hulshoff said she was ""stupidly"" in love with Steven Hulshoff, who she had met through an online online dating website.

""Everything that I thought was right and normal with dating just turned out to be wrong,"" Hulshoff said.

Hulshoff said she had a ""very nice boyfriend"" that she was ""very happy"" with, but later moved in with Steven Hulshoff, and the two became involved in their shared addiction and the resulting chaos. She said she has a difficult time believing in anything any longer – ""the pain is so bad.""

She said that she was trying to get into treatment – which was denied by Bremner – when she killed the baby, a boy about 6 months old, in November 2009. Hulshoff said she and her ex-husband had been living together in a ""perfectly happy environment.""

Hulshoff said she kept the baby ""totally out of public view."" She said she had kept him ""hiding"" in her home and in her closet for several days after the child was born, but finally went home to have it taken away two weeks later when he passed away.

It was then she found a post-mortem report and told her ex-husband, Steven Hulshoff, about what she had done.

She said she planned to give the baby to her boyfriend, but changed her mind. The two did not talk again for about a month.

Steven Hulshoff has been under treatment in prison for nearly two years, and his wife has remained by his side on and off since his release in July 2015.

"The only new thing about the world's biggest solar farm in China is the name.

The Hanhai-Tibet project sits on a remote mountain just west of the city of Qinghai – and China's energy needs have grown dramatically over the last decade. Last year's growth was nearly four times what was recorded in 2005.

The Hanhai-Tibet field is a joint venture with India's State Grid Corporation of India (SGCL), which is building a second grid connection.

""This is the first project in which this Chinese side – that has no expertise in solar – is using Indian expertise,"" says Wang Guozhi, chief executive of Hanhai-Tibet.

He adds that SGCL is providing ""the technology, the expertise and training for the Chinese side and this is the first step to connect China with India.""

But it is part of a larger strategy.

China and India have plans to create a solar power network, covering a total of 3,200,000 square kilometres by 2016.

But what will that network cover? The answer might surprise you.

China's energy consumption

According to Wang, the Chinese government has no idea what all the new energy generating capacity will be used for: solar photovoltaic, nuclear, hydropower or fossil fuels? But for now it does seem to be concentrating more on solar power.

Last month, China declared it would open up its energy industry to foreign energy companies, while earlier this year the country said it would offer loans to help struggling energy companies expand.

And that focus is evident in the Hanhai-Tibet project.

It is China's first solar farm to rely entirely on the sun's power – and in some cases, the wind – in order to operate.

While the field can produce about 4,000 megawatts of power (MW), there are two different areas used to pump solar energy into the grid: in an area around the mountain – which has only 500MW capacity – and in the surrounding landscape, which is closer to 10,000MW.

To generate the rest of the electricity, the plant runs on natural gas, with the gas pumped to the site via three pipelines.

""These [two] pipes are 100km apart,"" explained Wang. ""And we control which pipeline is on which side of the mountain and when.""

The project has been run for seven years, producing about 4,000mw last year – which is not enough to meet China's energy needs.

""We can only produce 4,000 MW. So, it does not help to generate 100MW [of electricity]. It's only 20MW right now,"" said Wang.

""We can't build any large-scale gas-powered plant [now]. At present, we can only produce enough gas to run the turbine at the bottom"
"The federal government is spending billions of dollars to oversee state college campuses, but the states are funding the bulk of the construction.

So when a scandal surfaced at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, some wondered if the feds had pressure applied to them to settle the case.

On Thursday, Gov. Pat McCrory (R-NC) told The Wall Street Journal the feds were not involved in the settlement.

""The whole thing has been discredited, just ridiculous,"" he said.

The federal government paid $32 million to settle a wide-ranging Title IX and sexual harassment case at UNC, after a female student accused the school's football players of raping her.

But the state, which is paying out $20 million of the settlement, is funding the remaining $30 million. And the state is also having to lay off more than 600 employees.

McCrory admitted that the Department of Justice, which he said was not involved in the settlement, should have been involved in the case.

""I think that the federal government needed to be involved. I think the university needed to be involved,"" he said. ""I think there was a lack of involvement on our part.""

"It's the most exciting week of the year! This week we'll be getting closer and closer to the release of a brand new expansion, the new Rogue-like game, Zombicide: Black Plague! I'll be back this week with a full report of how to get the expansion, what to expect, and a little surprise or two.

The full Zombicide: Black Plague expansion is getting close again, and I've been using the last week of summer as my development day. I've had a bit of free time to play the beta (available here), so that's been fun. When my week is over I'll be bringing you further news all week. But for now, let's take a look at what to expect next week!

Zombicide: Black Plague!

Now to move away from the board game and onto something that's more about fun! This week I'll tell you how to get the Zombicide: Black Plague expansion, in which we get to make zombies!

As you can tell from the screenshots above, the new expansion's been in development for a while, with it's release date pushed back almost a year. You can see the original Zombicide board game for comparison, which came out in 2005, and this new Zombicide board game and its expansion game was released in 2013.

The new Black Plague expansion starts you off in West Africa, where the US military is sent to investigate a mysterious outbreak. But that's only the beginning…

With the Zombicide core game, you're given the role of one of four human adventurers, each with their own personal story, who are taking on the job of combating zombies for a variety of reasons. With the Zombicide board game, however, we get to play a totally different role and get to explore a brand new continent.

We have been working on this expansion for the past two months (or so), and it is finally finished. The board game is almost finished too, but we're waiting for our print-kits to be finished before doing anything else. However, we're sure you can appreciate the excitement when you find out that this is our final chance to add the new board to your collection.

The new expansion introduces the new faction, the Toxx, as well as four different playable zombie decks that each have a set of five zombies with which to fight. And we're not done. The Black Plague expansion also introduces an entirely new game mechanic – the Plague Card.

Here's a quick rundown of those cards.

The Plague Card is essentially the Zombie equivalent of a Zombie Action Card. The Plague Card is activated at the end of enemy turns, and either gives all of your zombies +1/+0 or -1/-1, or is a simple -1/-1.

The ""Initiative"" cards, on the other hand, are"
"Madame de Pompadour

The first woman to be named Empress of France, Marie Antoinette was a powerful woman who was often in conflict with the Church. She was the daughter of King Louis XIII and Marie Antoinette Antoinette. Her father was a severe and strict father, who forbade her from wearing the veil and praying in public. However, she was an intelligent woman, and she was able to make him change his mind.

When she was about 15, she fell in love with the French tutor, Francois-Marie Pompadour, who was one of King Louis XIII's most trusted friends. Pompadour was a devout Catholic, and was unable to understand Marie Antoinette's devotion to God. She was also a woman who was not allowed to act in public, and her husband, Louis XIII, forbade her from wearing the veil. Madame de Pompadour did not know how to deal with this situation.

On one occasion she begged the king to let her wear the veil, and he agreed. However, the next day she came and told him she would like to be an Empress. In a fit of rage, Pompadour threw her away, and soon after, he married Anne of Austria, or the future Queen of France.

After the death of Pompadour, Marie Antoinette was allowed to wear the veil, and she began to pray and observe the Catholic faith. However, she was still considered a Catholic, and her father did not allow her to attend church services.

Marie Antoinette was an intelligent woman, and she was able to deal with her father's strictness. She also had a good relationship with Pope Clement VII. For example, when Marie Antoinette was being treated by the Pope, she told him she would like to be his mistress. The Pope accepted her offer, and he gave her a ring made out of precious stones. The Pope then sent a letter to the king saying that the ring was a gift from the Pope, and that the pope was proud of her.

She also had a good relationship with Louis XIV. She enjoyed his company, especially when he was drunk. She also had a good relationship with his wife, Catherine de Medici. During the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette was very popular with the French people because she was an Empress, and a woman that they saw as a great figure.

When Marie Antoinette died, her husband, Louis XIV, was heartbroken. The next day, he was standing in the courtyard of the palace, when he heard the news that Marie Antoinette had died. He immediately went to the palace, and after he had been told that she had died, he announced that he would not marry her. However, he did not want to marry the Spanish queen, Isabella of Castile. Instead, he married the Spanish princess"
"More than 2,500 Palestinian children have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched Operation Protective Edge last month, according to the UN Children's Fund (Unicef).

""The number of children killed since Israel's military operation began on 8 July has now reached 2,488, of which 1,837 were children under 15 years old,"" Unicef said in a statement.

""Nearly 2,000 of those children were killed in their homes. More than 1,100 were killed in their schools.""

Unicef noted that ""despite this level of loss, the number of Palestinian children injured has remained at roughly the same level as before the Israeli offensive.""

""The situation in Gaza is grave, the number of children killed and injured is appalling and the number of displaced children continues to mount,"" it added.

The UN agency also said that in the past month, more than 70 percent of the casualties were civilians, including a total of 1,109 Palestinian children and 154 children under 15.

On 31 July, Israel launched a ground offensive that lasted for three days.

Gaza's sole power plant, which was providing some power to Gaza, was completely destroyed in the conflict, and thousands of Gazans were left without electricity.

The Israeli military said in a report published on 1 August that it had carried out 22 air strikes against targets in Gaza, destroying 18 rocket launchers, five cross-border tunnels and two military vehicles.

About 85 percent of the total casualties since 8 July were civilians, according to the UN.

Gaza has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade since 2007, when Hamas took over the coastal enclave.

Since then, the blockade has severely limited the flow of goods into and out of Gaza, as well as the amounts of money that can enter or leave the Palestinian territory.

More than 2,200 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict.

Most of the dead have been civilians, including 1,462 civilians, according to the UN.

Israel's military said in a statement on 2 August that it would review its policy on allowing aid workers to enter Gaza.

""We are committed to ensuring humanitarian access to those in need in Gaza, which includes the hiring of an additional 17,000 Gaza health professionals and 10,000 teachers,"" the army said."

"The man who was caught on film brutally beating his ex-girlfriend with an iPhone has been named in a report as the man known to be a member of the Islamic State terror group.

Mohammad Safiyeh, 22, is reported to have been named in an investigation by the Anti-Terrorism Directorate.

He is also being investigated for allegedly encouraging the killing of his ex-girlfriend in January 2013.

The report, written by senior counter-terrorism investigator Fazel Haddadi and obtained by NBC on Thursday, said that Safiyeh has been active as a jihadist and was known to the ISIS terror group which now oversees a vast territory and a powerful military apparatus.

This information came from the investigation that was carried out the month before the killing of Fara Alawadi, Alawadi's husband Naim al-Hamed, in Dusseldorf, Germany, on February 22, 2013.

The report also said that Safiyeh's parents' home was searched on Thursday and that they received threats from the ISIS group.

Safiyeh and his parents have been living in Britain for two years. However, they have only lived in the country for a month.


The family have been in the news ever since the killing as they were named as a possible suspect as the person who murdered Alawadi's lover Naim al-Kurdi, a Syrian Kurd.


A court ruled out the family but the Home Office, which is responsible for security in this country, were forced to release a statement.

"For his next move, the city needs a little help, or the next best thing.

A group of city leaders and residents who want to have a say in what happens next to one of the city's biggest assets say they'll lobby city staff this week to find ways to make it happen under a plan they crafted.

Councilor David Grosso, who spearheaded the initiative, called the city's current approach to the project — called the Downtown Relief Line — ""a mess.""

The problem is a lack of public communication among top city staff and a slow-moving Metrolinx bureaucracy, he said, which left the proposal with no clear vision or road map for what to do with the $3.2-billion light-rail line.

It's too small, said Grosso. ""If Metrolinx would have announced in February we're going to start construction in March, we could have had the best-reviewed, best-implemented line ever,"" he said. ""Now, we're sort of waiting on a mountain of paper.""

The effort is a part of a broader push to ""turn the idea of public open consultation, for the public good, into a reality,"" he said. The group also hopes to persuade city business officials and members of the planning department to commit to public listening and meeting with citizens through community events.

It also wants the head of the city's economic development department, who has long been viewed as ""adversarial"" to the group, to be replaced."
"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — A federal grand jury indicted an Alabama deputy sheriff on Monday on charges that he violated domestic violence restraining orders by assaulting his estranged wife, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said.

Jeremy Mardis, a 35-year-old officer with the Metro Narcotics Task Force, is charged with two counts of felony criminal assault and one count of misdemeanor domestic violence.

The TBI said Mardis is accused of calling his estranged wife to the home of her parents to retrieve a package that had been left at their home and then assaulting her. Mardis is also accused of telling her to leave the home and then allegedly punching her in the face.

The TBI said Mardis was not part of the narcotics task force and was in the process of being fired. The grand jury returned the indictment on Monday.

The TBI said the indictment alleges that on May 8, Mardis called his wife and told her to come to his parents' home. Mardis said he received a package and left it at the home of his parents. When his wife arrived, Mardis said he punched her in the face before leaving the house.

The TBI said the grand jury also found that Mardis subjected his wife to domestic violence by calling her at her parents' home on May 9 ""to retrieve a package that had been left at the home of her parents.""

Mardis told his wife to leave the house but she refused, the TBI said. Mardis then called the TBI and told them he had punched his wife in the face.

The TBI said Mardis then called the TBI on May 11 to report that he had punched his wife in the face.

Mardis is free on bond."
"In a speech at the Tory Party conference today, David Cameron promised to ""invest heavily"" in the North East, claiming that ""there is no area of our country that is not in need of investment"".

But the Prime Minister was forced to apologise for some of his claims when asked about the lack of investment in the region during a BBC interview.

In his speech, Cameron said: ""In this hall, there is no area of our country that is not in need of investment.

""Every part of the country needs investment, every part of our country needs more jobs, more homes, more hospitals, more schools, more roads and better transport.

""And we won't stop until we've delivered.""

But when asked by the BBC's Nick Robinson why his speech didn't include anywhere in the North East, Cameron admitted: ""It's true. We've got an investment plan to support the North East and we will invest heavily in the North East.""

And speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, Mr Cameron said: ""I want to be a strong Prime Minister for the North East. I want to be a strong Prime Minister for the North East, because the North East is a wonderful place to live, work and visit, but it is a place that has not got the support that it needs.

""And I want to be a strong Prime Minister for the North East because we want to make sure that our country is strong by investing in its future and we want to be a strong Prime Minister for the North East because we don't want to see it in a mess like other parts of the country have been through.""

But Mr Cameron was forced to deny that he was giving the region short shrift, insisting that he was ""absolutely committed"" to the region.

""I'm absolutely committed to the North East, I'm absolutely committed to the North East region,"" he said.

""I want to be a strong Prime Minister for the North East because the North East is a wonderful place to live, work and visit, but it is a place that has not got the support that it needs.""

The Prime Minister also tried to promote his ""blueprint for a new, modern Britain"", which would see an extra £8bn invested in the North East.

The Prime Minister promised to ""unleash new ideas"" that would help create ""more homes and more jobs, more schools and more hospitals"".

The Prime Minister said: ""We will shape a new blueprint for a new, modern Britain for the North East.

""Our blueprint is to focus on creating more homes and more jobs, more schools and more hospitals, more schools and more hospitals.

"In an email to members of Congress, the FCC proposed rules that would require Internet service provider (ISP) cable and phone companies to obtain a user's permission before selling or sharing that user's private information like web browsing history or email content.

Although the commission failed, at least in this regard, when it came to net neutrality, as with net neutrality there is no such thing as a free lunch. The U.S. government is still paying telecom industry giants billions of dollars each year that they then give directly to lawmakers or the organizations that run campaigns for them on election cycles. What's more, a number of groups who oppose net neutrality have spent heavily lobbying on issues such as internet privacy measures that would prevent ISPs from collecting and selling users personal information. Last year, the FCC's vote on net neutrality was widely decried by the tech community and net neutrality advocates. At the time, tech companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft said that the FCC had overstepped its authority in imposing a policy that is still a fairly contentious issue.

In a recent article, the Washington Post describes many of these lobbying efforts, such as an ad campaign by a telecom industry trade group funded by AT & T, which highlighted ISPs' role in helping Congress get laws passed and the ISP company's own involvement in the development and implementation of privacy legislation. Similarly, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) published an overview in its latest blog post titled ""The Telecoms Aren't Helping Us. That's Not Fair. That Must Change."" The article details a series of telecom lobbying efforts, including one that focused specifically on lawmakers supporting bills that would have put ISPs under the same level of regulatory scrutiny as telecoms like phone companies (an idea that EFF claims was considered by the FCC's vote on net neutrality).

The EFF also points to a series of studies that have documented how ISPs have been pushing the FCC to pass policies that would have been harmful to consumers and to innovation.

""These studies show us that when an industry sees that new regulations are about to be adopted, they'll take all the actions necessary to kill protections before they're even passed and then, after the regulations have been finalized, use their political capital to kill them,"" wrote EFF staff attorney Jennifer Granick.

The FCC vote on net neutrality remains a topic of speculation, with many suggesting that it was a move that was made to appease Internet activists, who had previously criticized the FCC following its net neutrality vote.

In a blog post today, Google's senior policy advisor David Drummond explained how the Internet is already ""very divided about how we live"" given the ""many different ways that the internet is used."" He said that a new set of rules on net neutrality will stifle innovation and will further stifle the open Internet and a free and open internet, two things that Google strongly opposes. While Drummond does not explicitly say that the vote on net neutrality was part of"
"In the end, it was Donald Trump's presidential campaign that made the biggest impact through the use of social media for political advertising.

The Republican nominee has long been a social media skeptic, and has even considered shutting the feature down.

But several of his most influential supporters are now using the social media platform to continue their work, and their work is growing.

Hillary Clinton supporters were retweeting a viral video of the former secretary of state appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday, and they were also sharing their thoughts on the late-night host's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" comments about Hillary Clinton.

Notably, they were also sharing their thoughts on what the comedian said about Clinton.

""When a man with a long history of sexual assault says Hillary Clinton is 'not fit' to be president, does that make her 'not fit' to be president?"" Kimmel asked.

By Monday evening, some of Clinton's most ardent supporters had retweeted Kimmel's tweet, including Clinton's former presidential campaign manager Robby Mook.

Others, like former Obama White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer, retweeted Kimmel's tweet with a simple message: ""It's ok to be mad.""

Kimmel's comments came after he quoted a tweet that read, ""You can't be a feminist if you are attracted to men."" Kimmel also said that it was ""not ok"" for the hashtag #NotOKtoSayToAWoman to trend.

The post was actually written by a man and shared by a woman.

Clinton's supporters were quick to share Kimmel's tweet, sharing their own reactions.

""I agree with @jimmykimmel. @HillaryClinton is a strong woman. You can't be a feminist if you are attracted to men,"" tweeted Hillary for America spokesperson Christina Reynolds.

""I'm not offended that @jimmykimmel used this joke about @HillaryClinton, but I am offended that a group of people are making fun of it,"" tweeted Clinton's former campaign spokesman Brian Fallon.

""You gotta earn respect for yourself. And you can't earn respect by trying to silence people who disagree with you,"" tweeted Bill Clinton's former press secretary Mike McCurry.

""I don't want to see anyone bullied over their gender,"" tweeted singer and former ""American Idol"" winner Janelle Monae. ""I've been bullied since I was a kid.""

""I have faced more bullying over my gender and sexuality than any other thing in my life,"" tweeted singer and TV host Charlamagne tha God.

""It's OK to be mad. It's OK. You don't have to agree with someone to respect them. It's ok to be mad,"" tweeted former Obama administration press secretary Robert Gibbs.

"What a difference a year makes—just a year ago, the state Senate was in the midst of deliberating bills to eliminate the death penalty. Now, those bills have stalled in committee, and the death penalty is not on the legislative agenda until after the 2014 election.

As an Illinois House member, I've spoken at considerable length about my support for the death penalty. During my 14-year tenure I've introduced hundreds of bills. I know that if the death penalty is repealed or greatly limited in its applications, that a state's decision to continue to execute defendants will have a profound negative impact on the public and on those on death row, which is particularly problematic for those facing execution.

The death penalty is a matter of life or death for the individual involved. The death penalty, like mandatory sentencing, carries a disproportionate punishment for the crime in question, such as the death penalty for a murder committed in a small house with a single adult victim.

Furthermore, no individual defendant has yet been exonerated on the execution date of any of those defendants who are currently sentenced to death. These individuals have been convicted by the same trial standards used to incarcerate the individuals currently languishing on death row. When a defendant, and possibly other defendants before him or her, has been convicted by the same standard as those currently on death row, it is impossible to believe that the death penalty will not be applied in these instances. The lack of accountability for wrongful convictions would be the death blow to the integrity of the justice system.

The death penalty does not save money. If it were used only for capital crimes, it would cost significantly less for taxpayers to keep someone on death row for as much as 15 years than it costs to keep them on probation, parole, or house arrest. The vast majority of death row inmates served far too long to justify a capital sentence in most instances, resulting in an astronomical debt from the state. The state was able to save money by allowing individuals who killed innocent people to serve far more time while awaiting execution than those responsible for their actions.

As the state's attorney in the 1990s, I helped put hundreds of persons back on death row based on the flawed notion that an individual had to be found ""guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"" before the death penalty would be imposed. In fact, the death penalty for murders committed in the commission of a felony, such as murder with intent to murder, is reserved for those truly guilty of capital crimes. In contrast, most cases that end in the defendant's death because of the state's erroneous belief that guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt are clear-cut cases of first-degree murder in the commission of a non-capital offense such as domestic battery, armed robbery, kidnapping, rape, or sodomy, for which the death penalty is authorized.

The death of Kenneth Williams has reawakened the death penalty debate in Illinois. As a legislator, I"
"We are glad to announce the opening of the FRC tournament this weekend!

FRC has been around for a year now, and has proved to be incredibly successful! We have over 200 teams and more than $20,000 in winnings. For the last week, we have been planning, planning, planning. The team's first trip to Washington D.C to compete against other teams will leave us with over 1,000 pages of notes on the tournament. These are the notes I took while writing this blog post.

Team names

This is probably the biggest challenge that has occurred in the first few years of FRC. The teams that have been created have had different styles of naming. Some have names that sound like actual teams, others just sound like ""this is a team"" but no one knows if they are actually a team or not.

It is now the first time in the history of FRC that teams have been given a common team name! Many teams chose to name themselves after real players, the most famous being Team 1, but there is actually an entire team named after a fictional player in a movie by the same name. Fictional teams are not the only thing making it hard for new teams to take off.

Team names must not be obvious. A team with Team 1 as its name is obvious; teams with Names like Super Team and Team 10 aren't, so they end up getting picked on a lot. Team 1 is the most famous example of this, but there are many more in the FRC world. While it probably isn't necessary to be famous for your name, the FRC team was named after a fictional player, so we have to make the best of the name.

A team must contain a name and be created with the idea of an actual team. Names can be used if they are not obvious, or only if they are used to name a fictional team.

There are exceptions. This is probably one of the most important rules of FRC. The rules are written as if all the teams were named after fictional players. For example, in the rules, a team may not have a name like the Super Team or Team 10 names if that team was in no other way created by their name.

Teams must contain a name for your name

To make things faster for people that aren't as good with writing, we have made the rule more specific: A team must contain a name for you name.

"(CNN) A woman has been charged after a 10-year-old girl in Florida allegedly was forced to eat some of her own feces to keep her mouth from getting infected during an overnight stay.

Fort Lauderdale police identified the victim as 10-year-old Kaila N. Smith of Miami, Florida. Smith, who is being held on $2 million bond, reportedly told deputies that she had eaten one of her own feces after being left alone in the bathroom for nearly 20 minutes earlier this month.

The girl's grandmother, who was caring for Smith at an assisted living facility in northern Florida, told local station WPLG that Kaila is recovering as a result of the incident.

""The girl ate some of her own feces, so that's what she ate,"" the grandmother told WPLG. ""She wasn't drinking water. The room I was in, you could still hear the water pump running, so that was good.""

The grandmother said that she called police about 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday in response to a complaint from the girl's aunt.

"In May 2015, in a shocking incident, the US National Security Agency (NSA) conducted a cyber attack against a major European country, the Guardian reported.

The attack, revealed by the Guardian, targeted the country's foreign and defense ministries, the French intelligence agency, the French Finance Ministry, and the French telecommunications company, Telefónica.

According to the Guardian, the attack was conducted by the NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) group.

The article said that the European Union had been ""blindsided"" by the attack, which targeted several of its agencies. The NSA's alleged goal was to ""collect data on EU officials and their conversations.""

The attack was also allegedly part of a greater operation dubbed ""Espionnage Élysée."" The article said that the attack was an ""attack on Europe's digital infrastructure"" and to ""provide blackmail material."" The Guardian said that the attack was carried out by ""a secretive unit within the NSA that has never been identified before.""

The report said that the attack ""was launched from a US-controlled data centre in a suburb of Paris,"" and that the NSA was able to control the attack because of a ""glitch in the NSA's firewall.""

However, the NSA denied that the attack was carried out by TAO.

NSA Expert Responses, 'Biggest Cyber Attack'

Alleged NSA cyber attacker Marcel Lehel Lazar, also known as ""Guccifer,"" answered the Guardian's questions successfully.


""No, I am not the one who hacked into the French government,"" Lazar said. ""They have no evidence for this. I am the one who hacked into the DNC and the State Department. I stole their documents and gave them to WikiLeaks.""

""Are you the hacker from Ecuador?"" the reporter asked.

""No, I am not from Ecuador.""

""You are from Romania?""

""No, I am not from Romania. My name is Guccifer, the Romanian hacker,"" the hacker said.

The journalist asked: ""Okay, so you are the same as Guccifer 2.0.""

""No, I am not from Guccifer 2.0. I am not from Romania, either,"" Lazar said.

When the journalist asked if he was the same as Guccifer 2.0, the hacker said: ""No, I am not, because I have a different name. I am Guccifer 2.0.""

He said that he was not the hacker who had hacked the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the State Department.

The hacker continued to deny that he was the same as the hacker who had hacked the DNC and the State Department.

But more and more people are living in cities, where the cost of housing is rising and real estate developers are trying to squeeze every dime from the market. And that means the payment for a home in one of these urban areas might be a lot more than what you'd pay in a more rural area.

The average price of a home in the nation's top 50 biggest cities was $553,000 in the first quarter of this year, up 3.8 percent from a year ago.

That's up from an annual average of $516,800 that Lennar found in a previous report.

""It's clear that the demand for housing is growing in all 50 states,"" said Lennar CEO Bill Ford. ""With the housing market in many of our markets continuing to recover, we expect to see continued growth in the number of new homes we build.""

By the end of this year, Lennar expects to build 5,000 new homes in the top 50 markets, and another 3,000 in the top 25. The company expects to build more than 50,000 homes in the top 50 by the end of this year, and nearly 60,000 in the top 25.

When homes are built in cities, they tend to be more expensive because of the high density of people, which puts a greater demand on roads, sewers and other infrastructure. And housing systems are often more complex, requiring more management and maintenance.

The report also looks at how cities are growing, and how that's affecting the supply of housing.

The report's key findings:

• The biggest cities in the nation are growing faster than the overall U.S. population. Cities in the top 10 cities grew faster than the national population between 2010 and 2015, while cities in the bottom 10 grew slower.

• The biggest cities are the most, well, big. The top 10 cities are home to more than 63 percent of the U.S. population. The next 10 cities have about 12 percent of the population.

• The biggest cities are also growing at a faster rate than the overall U.S. population. The fastest-growing cities grew by 2"

"If there is a ""law"" that should be enforced against our state lawmakers, it's not the prohibition against drunk driving, the illegal use of weapons, or the failure to pay child support. Nope. It's ""no child left behind.""

A few weeks ago, House Bill 1, a bill by Rep. Rick Murphy (R-Marion) to implement a program that would require parents to provide a home-equivalency tax return for their kids, was killed in Senate Rules Committee at the urging of Gov. Bob McDonnell and the General Assembly. The program is now slated to be repealed in January.

It's not hard to understand why House Bill 1 would be killed. It's an egregious act, which would penalize parents financially for not providing their children with a home-equivalent tax return. It would force these parents to make a choice between losing their kids' federal education aid and complying with the law. It would force them to pay to send their kids ""Home Education Tax Deductions"" from the state of Virginia or risk losing their children's aid. It would prevent them from receiving the federal public school choice scholarship which is guaranteed as long as they sign an agreement with the Virginia Department of Education. And it would create a program that would take billions of dollars out of the state's budget for classrooms, infrastructure, and services.

We want to thank Sen. Jeff Tarte (R-Smithfield) and Rep. Bill Taylor (D-Staunton) for standing in the way of the Murphy bill and saving Virginia kids from this cruel program.

But we should also thank the General Assembly for listening to our voices, rather than forcing their views on our parents, teachers, and community members. We have given the State Senate the opportunity to vote on a bill that not only protects our children but also will better align school funding across our state. It gives families in Virginia a choice by requiring the Department of Education to send a home-equivalent tax return to parents of all children in our school districts. It requires the Department to determine if a family is receiving the maximum federal education benefits. And it prohibits these families from being able to receive the federal voucher.

No parent should expect the government to pay for their kids to go to a private institution. No child should think it's their job to get all their expenses covered, including their own healthcare and food.

We should be proud of how far our state has come in the last two decades on issues of equality. We should be proud to see the growing number of families that have equal access to good schools, safe streets and places to play. We should be proud that we have made progress and seen some of those gains reflected in recent years in the growth of school-age children participating in home- and community-based services across our state.

But we shouldn't do so while we are hurting so much for those that deserve such services."
"For some students, the most exciting part of the school year begins on the first day of classes. For others, it's the first official day after graduation. For me, it's an afternoon that I feel guilty for not having paid better attention to a whole week of academic research. Or as some of my peers are more apt to call it, my ""unfailing love affair with the school.""

The students are all different- a bit more intellectual than others, but not by much. Some of my classmates have been tutored to perfection, others have been forced into it. All of us have had to work hard in our classes. None of us had a chance to do anything in school besides focus on our studies.

It was in class on the first day that I first realized that my time at Hogwarts is never going to be like that of my fellow students. The first things I saw that made even more sense to me were Dumbledore's words.

""What is the matter, boy? There is much to learn before you graduate. This year, remember; learning will not be allowed. That is the way it has always been at school.""

""And what's the point to that?"" I said. ""There really is no point.""

""I have tried to change that,"" Dumbledore said. ""But it seems that many students do not understand what is intended by the title 'Apparition' at Hogwarts.""

I looked at him intently. ""What does that mean? Why can't these people learn about it?""

""I'm afraid it would take them a while to learn about. They often only learn what the teachers tell them, and it only becomes popular the moment something bad happens.""

I looked around and noticed that there's a lot of empty space on my desk. I started to ask why some books are there, but I saw that everyone was looking at me. I'm sure everyone has heard the stories that we students are in the midst of a witch hunt.

""The Ministry does not want students to know why these spells work. They are not allowed to know. Do you know what they say they are going to do next? If you don't know about it, you will be imprisoned. The Ministry is only waiting for a situation to happen and then they can enact their plan.""

""You were saying?"" I asked.

""Yes,"" Dumbledore replied. ""What I don't want is for anyone with a wand to attempt to Apparate.""

He paused and then added quietly, ""Because then we would have to teach them too.""

""And I think you're wrong,"" I said.

""I do not know this, of course.""

""Because you can't have that, right?""

Dumbledore shook his head. ""They have no problem if we teach them. What they don't like is"
"When you're a woman of color, you may think twice before crossing the street — especially in an area of high crime. But if you're a black woman in Brooklyn, you may be more likely to approach a black man than a white man in the same situation.

That's according to a new study conducted by New York University sociologist Erika Lee and published in the journal Social Science Research, which concluded that, when it comes to street harassment, black women are less likely to approach a black man than a white man.

""Black women are more likely to experience street harassment in a neighborhood that is more dangerous,"" Lee said in a statement. ""Given that black women have been shown to be statistically more likely to experience violence, the finding that they are less likely to call the police, and less likely to seek help from police officers, may reflect the sense of safety and security that they experience in these neighborhoods.""

In other words, while black women may be more likely to call the police than white women when street harassment happens in their own neighborhoods, it's not because they don't want to help. The researchers found that black women were less likely to approach a black man than a white man for the same reason that they were less likely to approach a white man: They were more likely to feel safer in a dangerous neighborhood.

A previous study in the same journal found that black women were more likely to call the police when street harassment occurred in a neighborhood that was more dangerous for them than it was for men — a finding that was found to be consistent across different cities.

According to the researchers, the finding that black women are less likely to approach a black man than a white man is consistent with previous research that has found that black women are less likely to call the police when they are assaulted by a black man.

The study, which included 470 women from the U.S. and U.K., also found that black women were more likely to face street harassment in a neighborhood where their family members lived than in an area where their neighbors did.

The study, which was based on Facebook data, found that black women were more likely to see a ""black"" man in their neighborhood than a ""white"" man. But they were less likely to see a ""black"" man in a neighborhood where their friends lived than in a neighborhood where their friends didn't live.

""This suggests that the social boundaries between neighborhoods are more fluid than we typically think,"" the researchers said.

This isn't the first time that black women have been targeted by street harassers. Earlier this year, a Washington, D.C., bar was forced to change its name after a group of white men harassed black women and girls during a night of bar crawls.

In 2015, a New York City reporter called the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to report that ""men in black hoodies"" were entering subway cars and"

Imagine you have a job that pays $30,000 a year. You don't have a college degree, but you do have a degree in marketing and a master's in business administration. A year before the job, you apply for a promotion to the position of executive assistant to a chief executive officer. In the interview, you show that you're knowledgeable about the company's products and services. Your interviewer compliments you, and you're hired.

This is the scenario that led to a lawsuit filed by a former senior vice president at a New York City tech company against the company's former chief legal officer, alleging that he fired her because of her background in the tech industry and her MBA. The lawsuit, which was filed today in federal court, is the latest legal setback for the tech industry after a series of high-profile gender discrimination cases involving senior executives.

The plaintiffs in the case are identified as Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, Jane Doe 3, and Jane Doe 4. They allege that John C. Suh, the ex-chief legal officer of Netscape Communications Inc., violated the Family Medical Leave Act by terminating Jane Doe 3's employment hours after she had sought leave from work to care for her mother and cancer-stricken father. The suit says that the company's policy prohibited employees from taking family leave and that it retaliated against Jane Doe 3 by denying her a promotion to chief legal officer.

""I'm very happy that the courts have recognized the situation in which the plaintiff was placed and that it's a standard that can no longer be tolerated,"" said John Donahoe, Netscape's chief executive officer. ""The bottom line is that the company has made a commitment to provide equal opportunity to both men and women, and we're going to do everything in our power to ensure that happens.""

Netscape issued a statement that said, in part, ""We take all allegations of discrimination very seriously and take our obligations under the law very seriously. We will vigorously defend against these claims."" Suh could not be reached for comment.

The lawsuit was filed against the company on behalf of Jane Doe 3, Jane Doe 4, and others who want to join them.

Sears Holdings

A federal jury found in June that Sears Holdings Corp. discriminated against a female employee who had been absent from work for about 10 weeks because she was caring for her terminally ill mother. The plaintiff, who had been putting in 60-hour work weeks, was given a severance package after she filed a lawsuit alleging that the company was negligent in the manner in which it treated her and tried to accommodate her mother's health issues.

Sears, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, is suing the plaintiff for $3.9 million in damages.

In a separate suit, former Sears Holdings CEO Edward Lampert accused the company of violating the"
"The first time I watched this film was on box office telly back in the late 80's, when it was re-released for the first time. This is the first film I ever saw where the main character was a woman.

I was not particularly impressed. I was not a huge fan of women in films at the time, but I knew that I would have to give it a go once more, and I was more than happy to give it a go.

The film follows a group of stick-up boys who have a grudge against a gang of thugs. The gang take advantage of the fact that they are all drug addicts and are willing to do anything to get the drugs.

The gang members are threatened with death if they do not give up the drug. The thugs decide to take a huge risk and go to a warehouse to see what is in the warehouse.

When they get there, they are attacked by the gang and the warehouse is reduced to rubble. The surviving gang members decide to go on a robbery, knowing that if they do not get the drugs, they will be killed.

One of the gang members knows that the warehouse is used to make heroin, so he decides to make a delivery to the warehouse.

The gang member drives the getaway car, but becomes trapped in the wreck as the gang members try to slash at him.

The gang members shoot at him but the bullets have no effect on him. They then leave him for dead, knowing full well that he is a drug addict.

The remaining gang members call the police, who are just a few minutes away.

The police arrive on the scene, and the police doctor informs the gang that they will not be able to save the young man. The gang members are furious at the doctor for telling them the truth, but the doctor is not willing to lie to the gang.

The gang members have a talk with each other, and the one who knew how to save the young man's life, tells them the truth. The gang members refuse to believe the doctor, but he is adamant.

The gang decides to go to the warehouse to get the drugs, and they go in.

Once inside the warehouse, they find a safe. They have been told not to open it, but they open the safe and they discover a bag of heroin.

The gang members are in shock, and they decide to escape the scene.

They get out of the warehouse, but the police are waiting for them. The police are waiting for them because the police have been told by the doctor that the drug is heroin.

The police arrest the gang, and the doctor tells them that he will be there to free them in a few hours.

The gang members are taken to jail, and the doctor is asked to identify the gang members. He is unable to do so, and"

""The truth is, there are no two ways about it,"" said David Miliband, the Labour leader, to the BBC. ""The UK is going to leave the European Union.""

Labour ran a campaign of fear and loathing, warning that the status quo could end in a Brexit tantrum.

Mr Miliband, who has always been a Eurosceptic, took the lead in his party's attacks on the EU. He called for strict controls on immigration and warned that the UK could be ""left behind"" without freedom of movement.

But Mr Corbyn, who has long argued for a European-wide policy of opposing austerity, has been the party's most generous pro-European. In a speech on Monday, he said the EU was ""the only force on the planet that has ever stood up for the interests of working people"".

""This is just the latest in a series of betrayals of working people by this government,"" he added.

In a speech to the Fabian Society in October, Mr Corbyn said that the EU was ""the only force on the planet that has ever stood up for the interests of working people""

""I've been clear all along that we need a new kind of relationship that protects our public services, jobs, living standards and environment.

""The truth is, there are no two ways about it,"" he added. ""The UK is going to leave the European Union.""

In a speech at the Fabian Society in October, Mr Corbyn said that the EU was ""the only force on the planet that has ever stood up for the interests of working people""

No one in the Labour Party is claiming that the UK would be worse off outside the EU. But the EU is the most important political institution in the UK, and Mr Corbyn's attacks on it will be seen as a sign that he is prepared to compromise on the fundamentals of the party's values and appeal.

The Labour leader also suggested that Labour's Brexit position was not a matter for the negotiation but for Parliament. ""We are not going to be able to negotiate our way out of this,"" he said.

He refused to be drawn on whether he would be prepared to accept the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. ""We will be campaigning for the best outcome that we can get,"" he said.

Mr Corbyn also retweeted a message from the Islamic State, which warned that Britain's exit from the EU would ""cause the rain of blood in every city, and village and hamlet"".

The Labour leader has come under increasing pressure from within the party to give more detail about his Brexit stance.

Although he has always made clear his opposition to the EU, Mr Corbyn has refused to say whether he supports a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal.

He has said that a number of Labour MPs are prepared to campaign for the UK to stay in the EU."

There is an old joke about the fact that most master-builders of, say, the Titanic, did not live to see the ship break the ice. The joke goes like this: ""Joe's parents were in a car accident; he died at the scene. However, he was buried on the day that the ship sank. The next day, the iceberg broke the ice and the ship sank.""

That joke, which was first published in Harper's in 1909, is relevant to the current debate about climate change. As the planet warms and sea levels rise, the icebergs that eventually make up the icebergs that eventually make up the ""titanic"" icebergs of the ice sheet will become more common. The same is true for the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.

These ice sheets are marine and they are changing rapidly. The marine ice sheets, like the one in Greenland, are going from being a vast, cold sea of ice in winter to being a vast, warm sea of ice in summer. The world's oceans are warming and the sea levels are rising.

Now, these marine ice sheets are melting. They are melting faster than they are gaining ice. The West Antarctic ice sheet is more than twice the size of the Greenland ice sheet and it is melting at a rate of 3.1 millimeters a year. The East Antarctic ice sheet is melting at a rate of 0.6 millimeters a year.

It is happening faster than many people think. A study published in Nature in December that looked at satellite data from 2003 to 2011 found that the rate of ice loss was twice as fast as previously thought.

The glaciers that are melting are losing a lot of ice. The ice loss on the Greenland ice sheet is about 0.19 cubic kilometers per year. The rate of loss is increasing, but it is still well below the 1.5 cubic kilometers per year that was projected.

The Greenland ice sheet has been melting for thousands of years and its melting accelerated in the 20th century. The ocean is warming and the warming of the oceans has caused the ice to melt. The oceans have warmed by an amount that is about 1.6 degrees Celsius since the turn of the 20th century.

The oceans are also warming because of the carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and it warms the planet by absorbing infrared radiation from the sun. The oceans are absorbing a lot of this heat, and the oceans are warming.

As the ocean warms, the ice in the ocean will melt. The oceans are warming and the ice in the oceans is melting. The melting is happening faster than some people think.

The melting of glaciers is not limited to the Antarctic and Greenland. Most of the world's glaciers are melting in the Himalayas and in Alaska.

The Himalayas and Alaska are serious melting areas. Glacier fields"

There is a song in the original stage version of Peter Pan called ""Barrie the Beard"" which was written by Maurice Sendak, and it was only the second song written for the stage version of Peter Pan. It was a song that was very popular among children and adults alike. In fact, people used to hang out in the street to watch the people walking by.

"For the first time, scientists have discovered a genetic mutation that affects only the male fetus and is linked to the increased risk for autism.

Researchers used new imaging technology to examine the internal organs of the pregnant mouse brain as they were being delivered.

""The ultrasound images provide the first anatomical view of the mouse fetus in utero, and shed light on the critical developmental processes that take place in the uterus,"" said co-author Mark D. Schechter of the National Institutes of Health.

It was previously thought that only fetal and maternal DNA are passed through the mother's egg and sperm, the researchers said.

This information is important for better understanding of how autism spectrum disorders—an umbrella term for conditions such as autism, Asperger's syndrome, and ADHD—can result from mutations in genes that help with specific developmental processes, they said.

The research was published April 14 in The Journal of Neuroscience.

The research was performed in mice with the MND1301 gene, which is known to increase the risk for autism. MND1301 is normally found on the X chromosome.

The scientists treated female mice with an injection to disable the MND1301 gene. They used this injection therapy for several days prior to the last few major phases of fetal development.

""When the treatment was discontinued after implantation, we identified a significant reduction in the number of X-chromosome copies, suggesting that we also saw a decrease in the number of XY (female) fetal cells,"" the authors wrote.

The researchers also examined the brains of these mice and found that only male fetal brains contained more XX cells—XY chromosomes.

""Because genetic information enters the fetal brain through the blood, we can estimate the potential for autism based on the number and types of cells in males versus females,"" explained Schechter.

In humans, a gene called KUBRA has previously been linked to autism. Other genes that increase the risk for autism include the KIT gene and the FOX2 gene.

Schechter said the researchers are planning to use imaging technology that will show even more details of the developing mouse brain."
"Published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the study shows that there is a significant negative correlation between the amount of protein consumed during the last three months of pregnancy and an increased risk of birth defects of the head and neck.

The researchers say that the study shows that the amino acids found in breast milk, which are essential for fetal growth, are also important in the brain and the nervous system.

The study was conducted by Dr. Elin K. Björklund from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Umeå University Hospital.

The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of studies done between 1990 and 2010 that examined the association between protein intake in breast milk and the risk of birth defects of the head and neck.

The researchers studied five studies that used different methods to analyze the data.

The researchers compared the data of the different studies and found that the highest risk of birth defects of the head and neck that was found was associated with protein consumption during the last three months of pregnancy.

The study's findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown that the amount of protein is important to fetal growth.

""In general, it is known that high-protein diets during pregnancy can cause birth defects. However, the significance of this finding was first discovered in the late 1980s and has been confirmed in the 1990s, when the main focus of the research was on the effects of protein intake on birth defects of the liver,"" says Elin Björklund.

She adds that the researchers found that the risk of birth defects of the head and neck increased with higher protein content in breast milk.

""A previous study has shown that the risk of birth defects of the head and neck is higher in women of low-protein diets. The results from our study suggest that the risk of birth defects of the head and neck is higher in women with high protein intake,"" says Elin Björklund.

The results of the study were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association."

"The only way to make a film about the historical events of the last years of the Roman Empire is to live in the Roman Empire. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the editors of the New York Times have chosen to ignore the realities of Rome and try to make History with a not-so-realistic view of the city of Rome. The editors admit that the Roman Empire had a population of 1.2 million people, but they make the mistake of thinking that the Roman Empire was a monolithic entity with a single culture. And so they make it seem that the Romans were just like us, and they ignore the fact that they had different customs, religions and languages than we do.

The Roman Empire was a very unique empire, and it had its own history. But they don't get to the core of the Roman Empire and have a look at the people who were living in the empire at the time, because they make it seem like the Romans were just like us, and they ignore the fact that they had different customs, religions and languages than we do.

One of the editors, Jonathan Rauch, put it best:

""The Roman Empire was not one empire, but many, and each of them was a distinctive society in its own right. The Romans of today just don't look like what the Romans of a million years ago looked like.""

He is right. The Romans looked nothing like the Romans of today, and in fact, I think I got the most accurate picture of the Roman Empire from Roman history books. I have read and re-read them many times, and I can confidently say that the Romans of today look nothing like that.

Here are a few of the points made in the New York Times article:

""Youthful and energetic, the soldiers of the Roman Empire were not just regular soldiers. They were also elites, stewards of the elite, manual laborers who had little interest in politics and less interest in law.""

The Romans were known for their heavy drinking, excesses of luxury, and sexual promiscuity.

Roman men were famous for being sexually promiscuous, and they were not shy about having sex with any woman they had sex with.

The Romans were not just regular soldiers, but they were also elite soldiers. This was the case because they were not just regular soldiers but they were also elite soldiers.

When the Romans conquered new lands they would recruit thousands of volunteers, many of whom were slaves, to fight alongside them.

The Romans had a huge empire, and it was a very specialized empire. They had a lot of different offices and official positions, which were all very specialized.

The Romans were known for being light-hearted, drinking, and for their promiscuous behavior.

The Romans didn't have to think much about how to run their empire. A typical Roman employed a combination of"
"The United States has announced it would not continue to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

The administration said the trade deal, which was approved by Congress, was up for renegotiation – a very difficult prospect, given the support it received from U.S. President Barack Obama during the campaign. The final vote was 53 to 46.

The decision not to sign TPP follows similar calls by other countries – including in particular Vietnam – that the deals be put to a vote, rather than agreed with the US, in order to allow for real-world scrutiny.

Although Mr. Obama has been supportive of the agreement, even saying during his re-election campaign that he expected to be able to get a deal for the TPP on the basis of ""loyalty,"" his decision was seen as an indication that the administration was tired of trying to influence foreign policy.

During his State of the Union address in January, the President warned against any new regulations that could impede free trade, although he promised his administration could bring in tougher regulations if necessary to protect American workers.

""I will not sign trade deals that kill American jobs or hold down wages,"" the President declared.

Despite some resistance to the TPP from his own party – who see the agreement as the best way to encourage U.S. exports – the President's critics had argued that it was a bad deal because it undermined national sovereignty when it came to the regulation of foreign-owned corporations.

""When it comes to trade agreements, we do not want our trading partners to be doing to us what we've already been doing to them,"" said Mr. Obama. ""And that's giving them a free pass through the back door when it comes to attacking our economy with new regulations.""

The President then pointed out that the current economic situation in the US is not helping matters.

""It's a little early to be pointing fingers about everything,"" said the President, but the economic challenges faced the country are ""deep and wide-ranging.""

The president argued that when workers are pushed down the wage scale, consumers are forced into tighter spending patterns and the US loses business to other countries.

""It is important for us, in order for our economy to thrive, that we start producing more than we consume,"" he said, and that means investing in our own domestic resources and making sure our businesses can compete.

The President stressed that the TPP was a good deal for the US, and praised the nations that had come together to put it together.

""We need a set of trade agreements that allow American goods to fill up our factories and American workers to fill our jobs,"" he said, adding: ""This TPP can help us achieve that goal. Let me repeat: This TPP can help us achieve that goal.""

The State of the Union speech marked the 20th year in a row that Mr. Obama has given one of"
"The most common and most obvious way is something called the 'convex hull', which is essentially a straight line, with a 'hooked' edge where it meets a hard surface, like a hard concrete floor or a metal wall. In the case before, the hull was a concrete tank, which was about to be moved from one location to another. This was only an example, but you'll get the general idea from the images and examples below.

The second most common and most obvious is what's called an 'antenna,' which is a 'circle with the inside diameter cut to a certain shape' (the same shape as a sphere) and a 'crest' (a 'ring' around the outside of the outside of the antenna). The antenna is called an 'antenna because the two convex sides of the circle intersect each other, meaning that the two ends of the circle are in direct contact with each other, not as one piece of 'glass'. These can be difficult to work with, especially when you find that your model does not have a flat surface on which you can work. As such, they're usually not included, but are often quite obvious in most cases."

"Barry Sanders is in line to play in his second Pro Bowl on Sunday. (USATSI)

On Saturday, we received word that the Carolina Panthers would make all their Pro Bowl selections on the field, and for the second straight year, wide receiver Steve Smith will play in the game because he was suspended by the league on Dec. 4 of 2014 due to his arrest over an alleged domestic assault.

On Friday, we received word that the San Francisco 49ers would make the Pro Bowl for the first time since 2011.

On Friday, we received some interesting updates on the San Francisco 49ers and their Pro Bowl selections. As mentioned above, the 49ers made all of their selections on the field Sunday, but they also decided to make their Pro Bowl selections via tweet. They also added a tweet featuring each player's Twitter handle and the team.

The 49ers used the above two tweets below to select all of their selections in 2016:

So, now that we got that out of the way, here is how each of the 49ers' selected players fared this year:

Quarterback: Blaine Gabbert - Gabbert played in two games with five completions for 65 yards. He also had three of the 49ers' 10 turnovers with one of those interceptions returning for a touchdown.

Running back: Carlos Hyde - Hyde rushed for 781 yards to go along with 8 touchdowns on the ground, which was good enough for 11th in the NFL in rushing. Hyde had an 82-yard touchdown run against the Washington Redskins, also had a 57-yard punt return for a touchdown and was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for both those runs. Hyde missed two games with a sore groin.

Wide receiver: Torrey Smith - Smith caught 81 passes for just under 2,000 yards and 14 touchdowns for the 49ers this season. Injuries limited his playing time down the stretch to just six games, playing only 13 snaps in each of two games, but he did make six catches for a total of 52 yards and a touchdown. Smith has had a big impact to begin his career in the NFL and was named to the NFC Offensive Player of the Week last week and the Pro Bowl last year.

Tight end: Vance McDonald - McDonald had four receptions on five drops for 63 yards and a touchdown. McDonald had an impressive year, making six receptions for 96 yards and two touchdowns in the final two games to help push the 49ers to the NFC Championship Game.

Middle Linebacker: NaVorro Bowman - Bowman played all 82 defensive snaps in the Super Bowl, finishing with 17 stop plus a two sacks. Bowman also made a tackle against the Denver Broncos.

Safeties: Eric Reid - Reid was the 49ers starting free safety for the entire season. He played a total of 75 snaps.

Cornerback: Eric Reid - Reid, the 49ers"
"The National Assembly of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has passed a law that will allow the family of Muslims who die fighting for a different religion than their own to be buried in Saudi Arabia, and to be given a religious burial in a cemetery outside the country.

The law also allows the family of a Muslim who dies fighting for a different religion than their own to be buried in Saudi Arabia, and to be given a religious burial in a cemetery outside the country.

The Bill was approved by the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. The text of the bill is available here: http://www.khaleejtimes.com/en/news/2405453/religious-burial-bill-passed-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia

The law supersedes the law that applied until now, which only allowed burial in Saudi Arabia for Muslims who died in the wars waged in the name of Islam, and who died in battle.

The new law (Sharia al-Shariah) will allow the family of a Muslim who dies fighting for a different religion than their own to be buried in Saudi Arabia, and to be given a religious burial in a cemetery outside the country.

The new law will also give the Saudi government the right to grant a religious burial to a Muslim who dies in a non-Muslim country. This right will be granted to all Muslims who died in non-Muslim countries, regardless of their religion.

The Bill will allow the Saudi government to issue a religious burial certificate to a person who dies in a non-Muslim country. If the Saudi government agrees to the burial of that person in a Saudi cemetery, the Saudi government will be able to issue a burial certificate to the person, which will entitle the burial site to be used for Muslims who die in Saudi Arabia.

The law also removes the requirement for the Saudi government to grant a burial certificate to a person who dies in a non-Muslim country.

The new law will allow the Saudi government to issue a burial certificate to a person who dies in a non-Muslim country. If the Saudi government agrees to the burial of that person in a Saudi cemetery, the Saudi government will be able to issue a burial certificate to the person, which will entitle the burial site to be used for Muslims who die in Saudi Arabia.

"A couple of weeks ago I got to hang out with a pretty cool group of people for a month at the MECC. The folks I met in that time were very good people and they gave me some excellent food and excellent ideas for how to take up yoga.

The MECC is a very exciting place to be as a yogi. There are lots of yoga teachers working their magic here and it's very inspiring.

What was amazing to me when I got to hang out with these teachers is that they were all so much more than just their work. They're all people, people who care deeply about the future of this city and want to make it the best place to live for everyone in the city.

While we visited the MECC, each of these teachers sat down to write out a chapter of a book they're writing on the topic of sustainability. They gave us amazing talks on their projects.

In one of those talks, I asked a very relevant question — If we want to transform our cities to be all that they can be, it takes a certain level of commitment. I felt like I had a lot of respect for those teachers when I asked those questions because they are very committed to this and to their friends and their community.

If we want to make our cities sustainable, we have to all do our part by adopting green practices.

We have to all take responsibility for making our communities healthier. We also have to do what we can within our own communities to reduce our carbon footprint at home and our ecological footprint out there.

It's going to be very difficult and it's going to take a lot of work, but if we are all working together, I think we can make a significant dent in the world's emissions.

So, to all of you out there who are interested in green practices and sustainable cities in the making, I'd love for you to share your ideas and your stories in the comments below.

The yoga and sustainability movement is huge right now, and it has the potential to really transform the energy system of Toronto."

"Successful training in the U.S. can make you an international millionaire. A new study from the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management found that high-achieving students who study abroad earn an average of $45,000 more over their lifetime than their American counterparts with the same level of education.

The study, which appeared in the latest issue of the journal Strategic Management Journal, looked at the earnings of students with the same academic record who studied abroad over a year.

The researchers looked at data from the Association of American Universities that tracked the earnings of students from 1992 to 2011.

The study indicated that the average student who studied abroad earned $44,000 a year. The study also showed that this number increased to $58,000 a year when students studied abroad for three consecutive years.

While this may be good news for international students who do not want to go broke, it is also important for those who want to start their own businesses. Most of the students studied abroad who earned more than $50,000 were in management or professional occupations, such as management consultants, doctors, or lawyers.

This is because these students became comfortable with working abroad and earned more than those who studied in the U.S. because they had more experience.

""The study debunks the myth that you need to be a genius to make it in America,"" study author Wade Kenworthy said in a statement from Rotman. ""It demonstrates that the actual opposite is true: A very high level of education can be a powerful asset. Students really do learn the value of foreign language, travel abroad, and team-building exercises. All of these contribute to the development of a global outlook and enhance the ability to navigate the challenges of global business.""

The study also found that the earnings of international students who studied abroad were higher when they studied for more than three years. This suggests that students who study abroad for more than three years are more likely to have mastered a language and to have gained the necessary experience to succeed in the U.S.

""Successful international students have a much higher probability of success than their counterparts who studied in the U.S.,"" study author James Murray said in a statement from Rotman.

"Two years ago, I was a young, newlywed lifeguard, and had just been hired by the city of New York, to go to work in the summer at the Staten Island public pool. At the time, I was relatively new to the job. I had never been on a lifeguard crew before, and had been exposed to the grueling work environment of the job. I was a fresh face, and not all of them were happy with me. But I stuck it out, and I was able to hit my quota, and make the team, and eventually even earn a promotion.

For a young person from a small town in Ohio, it was a big step. But I knew that it was the right move for me, and I made the most of it. I was able to make a good living, and buy a nice house, and a Honda Accord – a car I rarely used.

I was happy.

But I wasn't happy enough, and I didn't know why. I was depressed. I had given up on a lot of things that I wanted in life, and I had even given up on myself. I didn't think I'd ever make it to the top, and I was afraid to make mistakes. I didn't want to fail. I didn't want to disappoint anyone. I didn't want to fail. I didn't want to disappoint anyone.

The summer of 2014 was my worst summer yet.

I'd been to the pool a few times, and had a good experience overall. But I'm an inveterate introvert, and I liked the isolation. You're alone, you have no one to talk to, you're just trying to swim a little extra time to make up for lost time. But if you're in the pool with other people, you're constantly surrounded by people, and it's hard to escape. We were supposed to be in the pool for an hour, but we were there for an hour and a half. We were supposed to be out there another hour and a half, but we were out there for two hours. I was drowning.

I had been a lifeguard for four years, and there are only eight positions available for the summer. Each summer, the pool gets filled up to around 200 people, all of whom are in need of a lifeguard. It's difficult to find work for someone who has been with the pool a long time, because come the end of the season, you're usually gone.

When I laid out my case for being let go, I was told that because I was still working as a lifeguard, I was a penalty hire, and that they weren't going to be able to afford me anymore. I was told that I wasn't a good fit for the pool, and wasn't a good fit for their team, and that they didn't want me on their team. They didn"
"A group of US Marines is taking an unusual approach to addressing the problem of sexual assault in the military.

The Marine Corps is taking a page from the playbook of the Boy Scouts of America, which banned the use of ties and patches to identify gay scouts earlier this year, and is moving to ban the use of uniforms and ribbons to identify victims of sexual assault.

The Marine Corps began a pilot program in April that will allow a victim to submit a statement to the department that identifies the assailant, a decision that would have been unthinkable in the past.

The military's sexual assault prevention program, known as DASP, or the Department of the Marine Corps' Corps Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, is already under fire for its handling of sexual assaults.

The system has been plagued by delays and glitches, and this month it was revealed that the Navy had been investigating the Marine Corps for covering up multiple sexual assaults on ships.

Last year, a survey by the Department of Defense found that 25% of service members had experienced sexual assault, including instances in which a service member was unable to consent because of alcohol or drugs.

The Marine Corps plan to address sexual assault differs from the Boy Scouts' ban on gay scouts, where the organization sought to be inclusive and move past the controversy.

""What I try and do is encourage victims to come forward, and I believe we have been doing a good job in that regard,"" said Marine Lt. Col. Robert Newbold, a program manager in charge of DASP. ""What we're trying to do is make sure we are taking a proactive approach.""

The new approach is being applauded by victims' advocates, who argue that the Marine Corps' policy changes will help prevent sexual assault.

""In the past, it was difficult to find a crime in the military that did not have a victim,"" said Sarah Hurwitz, a lawyer who represents sexual assault victims in the military and the director of the Women Veterans of America, a non-profit group. ""Now, victims are coming forward and reporting crimes, and this is how we are defining a crime.""

The Marine Corps is also taking a different approach to sex crimes than DASP, which relies heavily on a victim's statement to the department to investigate and prosecute. The Marine Corps revised its Uniform Code of Military Justice to create a system of military prosecutors to handle sexual assault cases.

In addition, the Marines are trying to prevent victims from repeating the crime by having them undergo polygraph tests. The tests are used for membership in the military, such as to prevent membership in the Ku Klux Klan, which is banned under the military's code of honor.

The Pentagon is also trying to reform the way it handles sexual assault cases, which have been especially difficult to investigate and prosecute.

A report released last year by the Defense Department's inspector general found that military commanders were delaying"
"Romania is about to become the fifth EU country to accept a refugee camp for migrants, according to new information released by the European Commission.

Under the so-called EU Solidarity Regulation, Romania will now be allowed to house up to 3,000 migrants in a camp in the remote town of Iasi, about 100km west of Bucharest.

The EU Commission, which drafted the rule, said it had been agreed by the European Council and was expected to come into force this summer.

Romania's Prime Minister Victor Ponta hailed the news as a ""victory for all of Europe"" and put an end to months of uncertainty following the migrant crisis in the EU.

""We are building a camp of a charter character and we will take from August 1st all persons who, on their own initiative, wish to leave Romania and come to the European Union,"" he said.

""This camp will be built by the Romanian authorities at a cost of EUR 1.7 billion, and all the services provided by the Romanian authorities will be paid for by the EU budget.""

The EU Solidarity Regulation is part of a package of measures intended to help redistribute more than a million asylum seekers from Greece and Italy across the EU.

According to the Commission, the camp will be equipped with a hospital, school, NGO office, reception centre, health centre, accommodation and housing units.

But the organisation known as Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) was quick to criticise the Commission for the new camp, which it said would be built in the remote desert region of Iasi, which is in the northeast of the country, far from any road.

""This is a disgrace,"" said MOAS's Romanian president, Matei Ursu. ""We say to the European Commission: the people of Iasi want to be treated like Europeans, and not like a third world country.""

The Union Solidarity Regulation was only brought into force in June and has been criticised by the UN, human rights groups, and the European Parliament.

It was opposed on the grounds that the rule was not in line with EU laws and that it would discourage migrants from seeking protection in Europe."
"Getting started With the Google Assistant

Google Assistant has been around for a while now, and has come a long way since its early days in the Google Pixel and Nexus phones. The Assistant is one of Google's best features, and it's a feature that is only going to get better with each update to the Pixel and Nexus phones. The Google Assistant is great, but it's not really something you can use on your own. The Google Assistant is only available with the help of a Google Home speaker or through a third-party app.

You can download the Google Assistant app from Google Play. The app is a free download, and is simple to use. You can set the Google Assistant to wake you up at a particular time, or even have it wake you up at a certain location. You can also set the Google Assistant to tell you the weather or ask you to do a basic search, but there isn't much more to it.

While the app is easy to use, it's not the best app for getting started with the Google Assistant. The Google Assistant is a very new feature, and it's one that is only going to get better with each new update to the Pixel and Nexus phones. Google Home users can use the Google Assistant right out of the box by using the Google Home app. While it may feel like there isn't anything new to learn, you will quickly learn how to use the Google Assistant if you take the time to use it.

While the app is easy to use, it's not the best app for getting started with the Google Assistant.

Getting Started With the Google Assistant

When using the Google Assistant, you first have to set it up. You can set it up by using the Google Home app, and setting it up by going to ""Settings"" from the Home app.

Google Home users can set it up by going to the ""Settings"" screen by simply pressing the Menu button on the Google Home, then selecting ""Settings.""

Once you set up the Google Assistant on your Google Home, you can select the ""Settings"" menu button from the Home app to access the Google Assistant settings.

Here, you can choose to connect the Google Assistant to your Google account, activate voice search, or disable the Google Assistant. You can also adjust the Google Assistant's settings, including the Google Assistant's language, whether it will wake up your phone, or set the time when the Google Assistant will wake you up.

If you are going to use the Google Assistant with a third-party app, you will find all of the options for connecting the Assistant to your account and activating voice search.

The Google Assistant is currently only available for the Google Home, but it will be coming to other supported Google devices (such as the Pixel C) in the future.

"There's a lot of talk on the internet at the moment about 'The Last Supper' and its many variations. You can read about it in several books, and it's one of my favourite books and films, so I decided to do a little bit of archaeology just to learn a little bit more than just what the people on screen are wearing. I took a bunch of pictures showing what people around the world looked like wearing The Last Supper in the years 1250-1459. There are also a few pictures below that would need to be cleaned up if you think it makes a little too much sense. If you'd like to compare what people were wearing and compare it to the versions seen by Christopher Marlowe and Geoffrey Chaucer, read on. Some of the images here might be a little misleading, as some of the costumes are not in fact the originals but rather reproductions made by the artists for The Last Supper. The original cloths were made in Italy and are of a much higher quality than the ones we see in the movie.

There's a few things to note – it's always interesting to see images from different time periods, as in previous times the art of painting was different – and it's worth keeping the idea of the 'last supper' in mind as well. As you can see, both characters use different cloths, and there are differences for how different they use them too. I'm not sure you'll have a problem getting to grips with the differences as long as you remember that this is art and not a documentary, so be aware of that when reading and viewing. In terms of the'supper' itself there are differences between how it was presented in different parts of the world in terms of the type of dishes it was prepared on. Christopher Marlowe has a knife, fork ('chastes' in French) and knife (not fork) with him and a plate too. Chaucer has the usual utensils in his hand, knife, fork, knife, fork, knife and all the dishes are different too. The 'last supper' itself may have been prepared for the guests and eaten separately, so be aware of that too. But I'll leave that out of this post as there are enough other posts for this.

In short, the image to the right is by John McPoey, a Victorian-era costume designer. He designed the costumes for The Last Supper, and is also the one who gave some of the details about the last supper. He described it as like a 'barbecue dinner where you have plenty to choose from so you can choose your own dishes, and they make a pleasing combination.' He may have been inspired by The Last Supper, but that's not the only source by which to look for the details.

A few additional sources I found in doing this research were:

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A League City man was arrested after police say he called 911 to report he thought his car was being stolen.

According to police, the man called 911 on Feb. 14 and told them he had just been in a shootout with two men in his car. He said he had just shot at the men who had stolen his car, according to police.

Police say when officers responded to the caller's home, they found a pickup truck that matched the description called in by the victim. Police say the truck matched the description of the stolen vehicle in the shootout, and the suspect who called 911 said he was the one who had shot at the victims.

Police say the suspect, 20-year-old Cody Matthews, then admitted to shooting at the victims.

When police interviewed Matthews, he told them he had called 911 to report he had just been shot at. Police say he also said those two men were the ones who were stealing his car.

Matthews was arrested and charged with two counts of armed criminal action.

"Mauricio Pochettino will be without Vincent Janssen (Picture: Getty)

Tottenham Hotspur are poised to complete a £5million deal for Ajax midfielder Vincent Janssen as speculation grows about the future of Luka Modric and Andros Townsend.

Spurs are lining up a host of new faces following their dramatic promotion from the Championship, and Janssen looks set to add to Spurs' attacking options.

The 25-year-old Holland international is seen as a viable option and is expected to head for White Hart Lane this summer.

Ajax boss Ronald Koeman, meanwhile, has played down a transfer bid for Townsend, claiming the young midfielder is focused on helping his current club secure promotion to the top flight.

"1 - 10 of 12 #6. The Biggest and the Best: The Golden Age of Comics (1940-1959) The first half of the 1950s was arguably the golden age of comics, with many of the most notable comic book artists making their mark in this short span of time. It was also the time when a lot of the biggest changes were occurring, with the comic book industry evolving from a small underground hobby into a much more mass-produced medium.


While Golden Age heroes such as The Flash, Thor, Dr. Strange, etc. were still around, they were far more commonplace in the Silver Age, and the more mature content of the Golden Age had been eclipsed for the greater amount of time by the sexual content and more adult comics of the Silver Age. A lot of the work from this period, namely from the 1940s and 1950s, is still extremely well represented in current comics.


10 - 31 of 12 #5. Modern Masters: Stan Lee's Fantastic Four (1961-2005) Stan Lee has always been one of the most influential comic book creators of all time, and even in some ways he created the most successful line of comic books of all time, as well as having influenced countless other comic book creators in the years since. He's a one-man factory, delivering nearly every issue of his famous Fantastic Four comic book to our shores with barely a single page missing, a feat that has been achieved by literally dozens of artists who were more than willing to take a stab at doing things the Lee way.


It's hard to think of a more singular artist who has influenced comic book art and storytelling. While Lee's first run on Fantastic Four is actually the longest run on a single comic book, that didn't stop him from doing so many projects as part of the Fantastic Four line from 1965-1996. As the Marvel and DC Comics companies have slowly evolved into larger corporations, we can expect some of these more obscure Golden Age projects to get the due they deserve, perhaps even getting some sort of an exhibition of their unique talents.


- 32 of 12 #4. The Birth of Comics: Jack Kirby - From Kirby to Alan Moore & Jonathan Ross (1975-2005) One of the most significant influences on the creation of comic books came from none other than famous comic book creator Jack Kirby. He was a pioneer in every aspect of the industry, including story, art, characters, design, etc. Kirby was a student of Dr. Donald Blake, the head of Marvel Comics, during the same time that he was working for DC Comics with Alan Moore and Chris Claremont.


Kirby's first collaboration with Kirby on an issue of Superman was not only Kirby's first work on paper, but it also was one of the first time stories and concepts were allowed to be expressed in the comics. The book was entitled Journey Into Mystery after Kirby's first comic book title, and was published"

The rupee has fallen over 13 per cent against the dollar so far in 2016.

""The rupee is in a very weak position because of the central bank's decision to withdraw the convertible dollar, which is a very positive move which will help stabilise the rupee,"" said Bipin Sapariya, chief economist at ratings firm ICRA.

""However, the central bank's decision to continue with the lower denomination in the middle of the year is a disservice to the public.""

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to withdraw the 500 and 1000 rupee notes from circulation to fight corruption and terror financing following a Supreme Court ruling on November 8, 2016.

The move is expected to reduce cash transactions and deposit in banks by about Rs 15 lakh crore.

The central bank had also decided to move the current account deficit (CAD) ratio hurdle for the current financial year to 3 per cent from 5 per cent earlier.

The central bank had also decided to keep the CAD ratio for the current financial year at 3.5 per cent from 3.75 per cent earlier.

The CAD ratio for the current financial year is estimated to have touched 4.5 per cent, the highest since the financial crisis of 2008.

The CAD ratio stood at 4.07 per cent in the March quarter of this year.

In the first two months of this financial year, the CAD ratio stood at 4.48 per cent, but it is likely to touch 4.5 per cent in the March quarter.

Ms Sapariya said the RBI has been unable to stabilise the rupee with its measures so far and there is no visible improvement in the economy.

""The government, on the other hand, has been able to push the economy forward by increasing its fiscal deficit. But that cannot sustain the rupee's decline any longer,"" she said."

"A little girl in China who was born with a rare condition that made her look like her mother has been given a makeover.

The girl, whose name has not been revealed, was born in August of 2015 with a severe birth defect called microcephaly.

The baby, which is still in her first month of life, was born with a brain that was underdeveloped, leading doctors to believe that she did not develop fully in the womb with no connections between the brain and the rest of the body.

(Image: Getty)

""She was found with no brain and no external skull,"" said Dr. Wang He, the head of the neonatology department at the hospital, according to the state-run China Daily.

""Based on her size, she was probably born with a growth defect. However, we do not know what caused her birth defect.""

The infant, who was born weighing just 2.7lbs (1.1kg), was first seen by doctors at her parents' home in the city of Xixi, in Jiangxi Province, in November of 2015.

(Image: Getty)

The girl's parents told doctors that she was born with ""severe mental disabilities,"" but doctors were then unable to explain the strange condition.

After the baby was admitted to the hospital, doctors were able to identify the severe birth defect when the girl's brain was examined.

Doctors then performed a scan of the baby's skull and discovered that the infant had a brain that was underdeveloped.

(Image: Getty)

The child's face is also a sight to behold, as she has a small skull and a small face.

However, doctors have said that the child will be fine since she is 2-years-old.

(Image: Getty)

The girl's mother will be taking her to a specialist to have her skull altered, which is expected to take place in five months.

In addition to her distinctive face, the baby also has a small chin, a small nose, a small forehead, and a small mouth."

"I've had a lot of fun trying out every new camera that comes along, but my eyes just have not been on the iPhone and iPad as much as they should be. Sure, a few have been fun to play with, but there's so much competition these days I'm starting to wonder if the iPhone might just become too expensive, too bulky, too big, or too small. So I put two of the most exciting cameras on one compact tablet to see how they would compare.

This is not a comparison of the iPhone 8 Plus versus the standard 8 Plus. I've been comparing the phone's camera to a lot of other cameras to give you a sense with which to base your decision—and the iPhone 8 Plus comes close in a few spots, but it really isn't that far behind. If you're in the market for the iPhone 8 Plus, these are your pictures."

"The RIAA and MPAA have sued a computer game developer for using the music of ""Desperate Housewives"" in ""Rock Band."" The case came to a close today, with the judge saying that the music was not ""fixed"" and could be used in a game without the consent of the copyright holders.

The case focuses on ""Rock Band,"" a video game that allows users to play songs from popular music catalogs, such as ""Desperate Housewives,"" on their instruments. The games store on the Internet, where players can purchase and download songs, is run by Harmonix.

In 2009, the RIAA and MPAA took the game to court, claiming that it was ""copyright infringement"" because it used copyrighted music in a game that was designed to be played on the Internet. The court found that the use of the music was not infringing, and the court settlement didn't include the music itself.

""The music in 'Rock Band' was not fixed, even though the plaintiffs claim it was,"" Judge Robert W. Sweet wrote in his decision today. ""The music in 'Rock Band' is not a sound recording, but it includes elements of sound that are essentially or wholly unaltered or lacking the characteristics of a sound recording. Thus, for purposes of this case, the music in 'Rock Band' is not a sound recording.""

The RIAA and MPAA have now settled the case with Harmonix.

""Harmonix has recently come to terms with the RIAA and MPAA in a settlement that, amongst other things, creates a royalty-free license for the use of songs from 'Rock Band' in any of Harmonix's future video game products,"" the company said in a statement.

The music-sharing site Limewire, where ""Desperate Housewives"" was used in the game, has not yet commented.

""Rock Band"" has sold nearly 2 million copies since it was released in 2010.

The RIAA and MPAA are both trying to prevent new game companies from using popular songs in their games."

Are You Ready to Learn More?

I love learning. And when I don't know something, I'm sure I'm going to find some information on the internet and get an answer. But sometimes, I'm not sure what information to seek. Or I have a limited vocabulary with which to express my question. And sometimes, I want to see if I have a different reaction (or an idea) when I use a new term that may or may not be familiar. In most cases, I don't even realize that there are other people out there who have a different opinion than me. Here are some of the things that I look for:

• Why (or how) do you think this is true and what do you think the likelihood is that other people feel this way?

• What assumptions do you want to make but don't?

• Why is this important or significant to you and what is it?

• Is there an actual scientific study that proves it?

"In the past few years, a few ""trending"" stories about the health of the US economy have been made more or less widely known. One of the most discussed is the question of whether the US is in, or is coming out, of a recession.

But what's sometimes missing from the discussion, and from research like this, is the fact that the US economy is still struggling.

We're not there yet

This is not to say that we're not going to hit an economic ""crisis,"" and that all of these other ""trending"" stories will turn out to be true (they won't; it's not something we've seen happen before). But if the recovery continues at this pace, a ""crisis"" or ""recovery"" would mean a substantial loss of US economic productivity and living standards.

And because it's really unlikely — and, perhaps, that we're over-optimistic — we can still expect this to happen:

We see this reflected in the growth rate of productivity in the US economy.

The economy isn't producing as fast as it used to.

We also see that the US economy hasn't recovered as much as we'd expect from any given expansion. There is no recession — for instance, if the job creation in the US economy since 2008 was as large as it was from 2001 onward, we'd expect the economy to have generated a net 5 million jobs since then.

So what does all this mean for the future?

Well it depends on what policy we're trying to achieve. If we are trying to achieve a good economy, that would probably mean doing more with less and letting markets do their job. While this is certainly a way to strengthen prosperity, it's also possible to weaken it. And what, exactly, is it that the ""free market"" is supposed to be doing now?"
"A man was found dead on a beach in the Spanish enclave of Melilla on Wednesday, the same day the European Union opened an investigation into reports of a racist attack against a black man.

According to local media, a man in his 50s was found dead in the coastal town, which sits in the north of Morocco.

Cristina Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the Spanish interior ministry, said that the man's identity had not yet been confirmed and that the cause of death was not yet known.

The Melilla police said they were investigating the incident.

The European Union on Wednesday opened a probe into reports of a racist attack on a black man in Melilla.

""The European Union is deeply concerned by the reports of a racist attack on a black man in Melilla. The EU has opened an official investigation and will continue to work closely with the Moroccan authorities,"" the EU said in a statement.

On Wednesday, authorities said they had seen photographs of a man believed to be the victim, but it was too early to confirm his identity.

The incident comes a day after Melilla, a Spanish territory in North Africa, reopened after being sealed off for six weeks following a riot over the weekend.

The European Union, which has recently been cracking down on the migrant flow from the Middle East and Africa, has been working closely with Morocco to tackle the problem.

The EU has banned the entry of nearly 40,000 migrants and returned them to Turkey, which has been hosting them in camps for refugees.

In a sign of the EU's growing frustration with Morocco's migrant policy, the bloc has also threatened to put pressure on Morocco into accepting more migrants.

Morocco's King Mohammed VI met with European Council President Donald Tusk at the Palace of King Mohammed VI in Morocco's capital of Rabat on Wednesday.

Tusk told reporters that ""the King shared with us his concern over the situation in Melilla and his desire to see the situation resolved as soon as possible.""

The EU has established an anti-migration frontline in Libya to stem the flow of migrants from North Africa.

Nearly one million migrants have arrived in Europe by sea this year, many crossing from north Africa."
"The Portland Timbers today announced that the club has signed defender Nathan Sturgis to a contract for the 2013 season. Per league and team policy, terms of the contract were not disclosed.

""We are very happy that Nathan is coming back and turning his attention to the Timbers,"" said Timbers general manager Gavin Wilkinson. ""He has a lot of experience at the level we play at and we look forward to seeing him again in 2013.""

Sturgis, 21, was originally selected by the Timbers in the first round (14th overall) of the 2011 MLS SuperDraft. In 14 games with the Timbers who finished the season on the short end of a seven-game losing streak, the defender scored two goals and made one assist. Sturgis, a native of Portland, Ore., was acquired by the Timbers in January 2012 as part of a trade with the Chivas USA. He made eight appearances with the Timbers before being loaned to Chivas USA before signing with the Timbers.

After being loaned to Chivas USA, Sturgis returned to the Timbers, playing a total of eight games, scoring two goals and making one assist. Sturgis was traded to the Portland Timbers on January 26, 2012 in exchange for defender Ryan Miller. Sturgis played in two games for the Timbers in 2012, totaling one assist."

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.

We have been tracking the development of Unity's Asset Store for a while now, and as I look through the catalog I can't help but notice one glaring omission from a catalog that contains over 15,000 assets at launch. That omission is the addition of the ""Unity VR"" asset system for 2D VR applications!

This asset system was announced at Unity's 2017 GDC session on April 26th, and in their keynote from April 28th. Although you can start using it now in the Unity Dev Tools, it is currently only available as an experimental build under a specific license (don't use it outside of Unity and make sure to follow instructions from Unity when you do).

In my research for this post, I found that there are currently two projects using this asset system: an interesting AR gaming project called ""ArtsVR"" that recently raised some $2,200,000 within the first 20 minutes of its fundraising, and an Oculus Rift DK2 prototype which had its own Kickstarter campaign recently raising $4,000,00 USD. This is not a big surprise to me, since I am a huge fan of VR applications and have been tracking these projects for some time now.

So what is this asset system for, and does it bring much needed support to VR developers?

To begin, the idea is to give developers tools to ""tune"" game models into VR or AR in a simple and quick way. You just need to drag-n-drop the ""VR"" or ""AR"" models to your project and the asset will generate a custom 3D mesh for the game where the players eyes have gone.

The resulting mesh has three dimensions instead of the game's two, allowing the camera to follow the objects in the scene a lot easier and reducing the amount of head tracking needed. And since the meshes are generated in real-time from VR or AR game data, the games will only need to be rebuilt if they are re-done or updated. And if the Unity team can take a piece of the Oculus DK2 mesh and put that into Unity 5 instead (using Unity's Unity 3D editor), they can take a piece of the AR mesh and put it into Unity VR. I imagine that it will be easy for Unity to take some of that AR data from Oculus and build it into Unity VR too once it's ready for beta testing.

This asset system gives Unity VR developers the ability to put together cool 2D and 3D visuals that they otherwise wouldn't be able to do and give those game developers a way to create immersive and interesting experiences that take advantage of VR and AR gameplay possibilities.

In the Unity Dev Tools, it's possible to preview how the assets"
"The number of illegal immigrants entering and staying in the United States at the United States-Mexico border fell in October by nearly half, the Obama administration said Tuesday.

The number of apprehensions, or migrants who are already here. fell to the lowest point on record, with 6,587 illegal immigrants apprehended along a 1,989 mile section of the border, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said. The lower number is the first decline to have been observed in that section since October 2002, officials said.

That's the same month that then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush signed an amendment to the federal immigration law that would have cut back on the number of immigrants coming to the U.S.

The Obama administration had forecasted that nearly 18,000 would be captured during the October surge in the number of illegals pouring across the U.S.-Mexico border, but Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the actual number is lower."
"It's a sad day for baseball fans, but it's also one that is likely to inspire an exciting series of reactions. The Orioles finally went out and signed a major league-ready starting pitcher, one who would be a game-changer for someone like the team's current starting pitcher or even a replacement caliber right handed starting pitcher down the road. Of all the players on the market this spring, and all the prospects the Orioles were supposed to add this offseason, it's Brian Matusz that the Orioles chose to sign with their big league team.

The 32-year-old right-handed pitcher had just completed one season in the minor leagues with the Orioles where he posted a 6.16 ERA in 36 innings pitched. Matusz put together a strong showing at the MLB level over the past couple of years, but his time spent in Double-A was largely unsuccessful, as he posted a 4-13 record with a 5.53 ERA in 27 innings combined in 2014-15. Those stats don't make it feel like a big deal, but given the amount of money involved, it's not hard to understand how teams like the Yankees or Giants might have been interested in bringing Matusz to their side.

Since joining the Braves organization, Matusz's numbers have been far below what they were at the MLB level. In 2014, he pitched to a 5.54 ERA, striking out 19 and walking 18. That number was a little better that the year before, but has since regressed once again. As such, he has a 6.50 FIP, meaning his runs allowed have been over 6 runs in each of his four seasons in the major leagues. But Matusz doesn't get the credit to what he could be doing when he's not being beaten up by a lower level starting staff. This past season he started 12 games for the Braves, tossing 20 1/3 innings, and had a 2.98 ERA and a 3.16 FIP. And he just recently turned 21…

While some might argue that it's simply a product of playing around 90 MPH in the minor leagues, he has shown he can generate a lot more than average results at that speed. So while it's true that he's not great right now, he still has a lot of power left in the tank.

On top that, the right handers he faces don't really have much to fear from him. His career FIP against left handed pitchers has been below 3, indicating he would give opposing right handed pitchers nothing much more than a couple of sliders and maybe a fastball that runs up. So what does it say when he got the Orioles offer? The answer is, not much. It's probably not a bad sign that the Braves let Matusz go for a player of his capabilities, just because of the potential upside.

His power should help at the big league level too, though perhaps"
"In its response to the federal government's request for data on how many people were arrested in the United States following the March 11 terrorist attacks in New York City, Facebook said it had not yet received a ""formal request"" from law enforcement agencies.

""When we receive a formal request, we will review it and provide information we have about our users,"" the company said in its brief response.

Facebook's data, which it revealed last week, showed it had identified at least 10,000 people who had ""shown interest"" in or participated ""recently in a protest or demonstration"" around the United States. Facebook also said it had identified some 5,000 people who had ""maintained a profile in a known Facebook group associated with a protest or demonstration.""

The social media company was among eight tech companies that were asked by the Department of Homeland Security to produce user data in response to a congressional mandate.

While Facebook said it had not yet received a formal request, it also has not stopped voluntarily sharing data with law enforcement, said Jason Weinstein, its vice president for federal regulatory policy.

In 2014, Facebook voluntarily provided information for a U.S.-only probe of a man it identified through information on its own service. Facebook also allowed the government to search its system for evidence that the man was a terrorist.

Weinstein said the company has not provided the government with information beyond what is required under laws of the United States. He also said the government was asking for ""unlimited data.""

""We will comply with any lawful orders, directives, or requests for information we receive unless prohibited by law, as we have done in the past,"" he said.

The other tech companies that gave information to the government in response to a congressional mandate are Apple, Alphabet Inc's YouTube, Microsoft, Snapchat, PalTalk, Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Twitter.

The government is expected to release the data on Friday, though the details are not expected to be complete until next week, said one person familiar with the matter. The full data set may not be released until at least September.

"The AngularJS team released version 1.3 last week. In this post, I will try to give a general overview of what has changed in the library and what new features are in store for it.

What's new in 1.3

At the moment, 1.3 is a major release, bringing a lot of changes to the library. Most of the changes are related to the framework, but we also have new features.

First, we have the new debugger, which is an excellent tool in its own right. You can attach to JavaScript objects and inspect them like you would any other object. It also has some simple debugging features (like stepping, stepping multiple times, etc.) and an option to display an error message after the execution.

The project has also received several improvements to the DOM API.

This is only a small part of what's new in this release, but it is still worth mentioning.

The debugger is another huge improvement that has made its way to the library. You can debug using any debugger out there, but the one that has been added in 1.3 is the Google Guice Debugger.

Google Guice is a library for building modular JavaScript applications. This is presumably a good thing for project authors, as it allows them to use their own custom components for their components, and reuse those components in other projects.

For example, if you use AngularJS in an Angular application, you can use Angular's $q service. This is because AngularJS is a library, and if you want to use it in your application, you have to include it in your application.

However, this is not a good thing for project developers. If you want to use AngularJS in your application, you have to include Angular's $q service in your application.

A problem with this scenario is that it makes it difficult to test your application by simply installing the library from npm. You have to install the library, install all the required dependencies, and then run scripts in order to see the effect of your changes.

As a result, many developers end up creating custom components and writing their own tests to help with this process.

With the new debugger, you can attach to any JavaScript object. You can inspect the variable that has changed, and you can step through the variable.

Here is an example of how you can use the debugger.

(function () { var r = $q.ref; var str = 'Hello world'; var err = $q.error; $debug.debug(str, err); })();

This is an example of how to use the debugger.

A nice thing about the debugger is that you can start debugging the current scope at any time.

The debugger also provides other debugging features than those of the basic debugger, such as stepping through the execution of the"
"Bolivia was declared the world's first carbon-neutral country in 2009 and is also one of the lowest emitters of greenhouse gases, the United Nations Environmental Programme said on Monday.

The government-run body in a report on the first 15 years of development predicted Bolivian carbon emissions will hit zero in 2030, while its emissions from agriculture could also decline.

The Uneven Climate: Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Bolivian Nations and Regions, a report by the UEP's Greenhouse Gas Reduction program and an NGO, forecast Bolivia's greenhouse gas emissions would decline by 25.1 percent between 2008 and 2025, from 1,120 million metric tons to 735 million metric tons.

The United Nations said in March there would be no net increase in carbon emissions in 2016 as a result of the historic Paris climate change accord.

Bolivia was a leader in international efforts to fight climate change as it cut carbon emissions by 25 percent between 1990 and 2008.

UEP Climate Initiative General Secretary Achim Steiner said Bolivia's energy sector, which already sources less than 5 percent of its electricity from fossil fuels, would get a boost if its emissions cut and its GDP continued to grow at comparable rate."
"The loss of a loved one hurts. It's hard to get over it. If you are dealing with grief, it's helpful to know that there are many ways to cope.

As a bereaved parent, you're probably thinking about how to help your child through this period of mourning. You are likely also thinking about what you are going to do when the time is right, and how you are going to handle your mourning process.

In this article, we'll look at ways to help your child get through the grief process and how to deal with all of the emotions that are sure to arise.

Self-Help

To help your child through the grief process, focus on your own grief process. You can do this by remembering that you are not the parent who died, but your child.

Look at your own feelings. How do you feel about your child? How do you feel about how things turned out? How do you feel about how your child would have responded to the loss?

Remember your own grief process. Be conscious of your feelings. If you are feeling angry, overwhelmed, or angry about your child's loss, it's a good idea to do some self-talk.

Listen to your feelings. It's important to listen to your own feelings during this time. It is normal to feel some sadness, anger, and even fear at times. If you are feeling overwhelmed, you may need to take a break from the grief process.

Take some time to do things you enjoy. What do you like to do? What activities do you enjoy doing? If your child is still in the house, it's a good idea to take a walk. It is also a good idea to read something that you enjoyed.

Do something together. If you are feeling lonely, it is helpful to spend some time together. This is not a time to argue or fight, but to simply sit together and be with your partner. This will help you both get through the grief process and find some small respite from the sadness.

Get some sleep. It may be difficult at times, but it is important to get some sleep. If you are going to take a break from the grief process, it is a good idea to get some sleep.

Some people may have one specific coping mechanism that they use during grief. For example, some people may use their religion to deal with the loss. Others may be able to access additional coping strategies like alcohol, drugs, or therapy.

It is important to remember that grief is an individual process. That means that every person's grief process is unique. Each person's grieving process is different.

How to Help Your Child Through Grief

Now that you understand how to cope with your own grief process, you can start helping your child cope with the loss.

These are some of the most important things that you can do as"
"The Obama administration is launching a new Internet-based report card on police departments, a move that will reward departments that have made strides in improving transparency and accountability.

The report card will be released in mid-February and will include scores from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

It will be the first time that the federal government has issued a national report card for policing, the White House said in a statement. The administration hopes to encourage states to share their data with the government as well.

The White House said that a number of factors were taken into account when making the report card, including whether the state has a ""promising"" law on body cameras, accountability for police, transparency and the use of force.

In March, the Obama administration said that it was giving $75 million in grants to help police departments improve transparency and accountability.

The federal grant program was aimed at improving transparency and accountability in police departments across the country.

The Justice Department has given $5.7 million to seven police departments, including $1 million to the Baltimore Police Department and $500,000 to the Washington, D.C., police department."
"We have reached a point in American life when the conversation becomes a simple one: What does it mean to be an American? An American is a person who believes in a set of principles and values that help guide the way a person thinks, acts, and lives. He or she is a member of an ethnic group, a gender, a political party, or religion.

The phrase ""American"" is so plentiful that it can seem like a meme. It is not. It is a real term, with real roots.

The first recorded use of the term ""American"" is in 1749, when a letter was sent from President George Washington to the Honorable Thomas Jefferson. The letter included the line ""This country, with all its power, might have been a kind of Paradise, except it had been subjugated by the natives.""

The term ""American"" was used in the same way by Thomas Jefferson in 1820 when he wrote ""It is not in the power of the United States to take away that freedom and independence which belong to every man in America.""

In the 1880s, a Congresswoman from New York called herself the ""American"" because she believed in the ""freedom and independence"" of Americans.

In the 1930s, the NAACP called itself the ""American Negroes"" because it believed that all Americans should be treated with respect, regardless of their race.

In the 1990s, the Republican Party called itself the ""American Conservative Party"" because it believed that America was a shining city upon a hill and traditional values were the best way to preserve that freedom.

The term ""American"" has been used in political rhetoric ever since.

The question of what it means to be an American has been the subject of much debate.

Some scholars argue that an American is a person who has the same values and principles that the Founding Fathers had. That view of an American is sometimes called ""conservatism,"" a movement of people who believe in the principles and values of America's Founding Fathers.

Others argue that an American is a person who believes in a set of principles and values that guide a person's thinking, acting, and living, as the Nation's Founding Fathers did.

This view is sometimes called ""liberalism.""

In the past, liberals and conservatives have fought bitterly about the meaning of the term ""American.""

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, liberals and conservatives fought bitterly about the meaning of the term ""American.""

"Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that he would be willing to serve as the United States' ""ambassador-at-large for peace"" if President-elect Donald Trump appoints him.

Kerry served as secretary of state from 2013 to 2014. He said in the interview that Trump has ""no interest"" in a peace process and maintained that the U.S. is ""delusional"" if its goal is to ""occupy"" Israeli-occupied territory.

""I think it's delusional, that's right. I think it's delusional,"" Kerry said.

""And I think it's dangerous to think that we can somehow try to, you know, occupy a part of the world that is not occupied,"" he added. ""There are other people in the world who would like to live in peace in that part of the world. It is not our intention or our goal to try to do that. And in the meantime, we can't have a situation where there has been an absence of peace.""

Kerry also said that Trump's claim that the U.S. should ""absolutely"" stay in the Paris climate agreement ""is a joke.""

""It's, I think, a joke. I mean, it's, you know, you're talking about something that doesn't even exist,"" Kerry said. ""It was not ratified by the Senate. It was, in fact, thrown out by the Supreme Court. And so, you know, you're talking about something that didn't get to the floor of the Senate. It didn't get to the floor of the Assembly of States. It's the kind of stuff that you take seriously, but you don't take seriously in the Oval Office.""

Kerry said that ""there's a lot of things that Donald Trump's said that are very, very troubling to me"" and that he is ""not sure he's got the right foreign policy in terms of, you know, the kind of world view.""

Kerry, who served as U.S. envoy to the Middle East during the George W. Bush administration, suggested that Trump's picks for secretary of state and secretary of defense have been ""a little bit more hawkish than I would have thought.""

""I think the secretary of defense, I think there are some things that he's said that have been a little bit more hawkish than I would have thought,"" Kerry said. ""I've spoken to General Mattis, I think he's a very fine man, I think he's a man of great integrity. I think he's a man I respect, I think he has in his mind and in his heart a very clear understanding that the security of the United States, the safety of the United States, is not dependent on somebody else having their way.

"In an interview with a Chinese news outlet, an unidentified person from the ""Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference"" (CPPCC), a party think tank, expressed the hope that the United States and the West can become more cooperative towards China.

Speaking with Sina News, the unnamed person said the world cannot rely on self-declared ""Greater China"" as it faces a global struggle over the future of democracy and the rule of law, especially in the Asia Pacific.

""We need the participation of China in the world to keep the peace and stability in this region,"" he said.

The anonymous person said, ""It would be very wrong for China to only sit in [the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership] and not participate in any other initiatives to promote peace and stability in the entire region.""

Earlier this month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence traveled to China to try to reassure Beijing. He vowed to help develop a ""new era of cooperation"" with Beijing.

The CPPCC, a think tank created by Chairman Xi Jinping, is the top policy organ of China's ruling Communist Party."

"A U.S. Army officer assigned to a military base in Fort Bliss, Texas—home of Fort Hood, where gunman Major Nidal Hasan went on a shooting rampage in 2009—is allegedly a member of a group of soldiers that made death threats toward Muslim students in Kuwait earlier this week.

Lt. Col. Mark S. Killebrew, an instructor at the U.S. Army's School of Infantry at Fort Bliss, allegedly made the threatening phone calls from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates late Monday or early Tuesday. The Kuwaiti calls were received by a base security officer, according to Fox News, and the UAE calls were received by two ""officers of the Joint Military Police"" stationed at a military base, though the officer responsible for the UAE calls was not identified in the news report.

Killebrew has been with the Army since 1998, and is scheduled to receive a promotion to brigadier general in June. He also has some military experience, having served as an officer in Afghanistan's National Police Force and the U.S. Army's First Brigade Combat Team, Second Infantry.

The U.S. Army confirmed to Fox News that Killebrew would be placed on administrative leave once the investigation into the incident was completed.

Fort Bliss, the headquarters of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, is located about 50 miles east of Little Rock, Arkansas.

In 2009, Hasan opened fire inside the gates of Fort Hood, killing 13 and injuring 30. Hasan's actions sparked widespread discussion on gun control and racial profiling in the U.S. military.

The Army did not directly address the incident in the news release, in which an additional soldier was also identified for making the threatening phone call to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, but added, ""The Department of the Army would remind anyone receiving communication that threatens, attempts or refers to death, harm and/or physical, material or psychological harm, that immediate action should be taken to report the information, and contact law enforcement.""

"""No"" is the keyword that will come to be said in the wake of the most divisive decision on the eve of the new season. No, the decision by the Board of Governors of Major League Soccer not to re-sign D.C. United's Fabian Espindola is not a vote of confidence in the man who has been in charge. No, it is a vote of confidence in expansion, in the new league that is looking to come to the United States, in the new owners, in the new strategy.

""The decision by MLS to not re-sign D.C. United forward Fabian Espindola is not a vote of confidence in the player,"" said MLS commissioner Don Garber in a statement provided to MLSsoccer.com. ""It is, rather, a vote of confidence in MLS' new approach to player acquisition, in the new league and in the expansion process. We believe that with that new approach, DC United and all our other competitors on the West Coast can continue to compete for the national and global titles with the level of quality, competitiveness and excitement that the fans deserve.""

Espindola was on the brink of ending up on the other side of the Pacific coast last summer after the Portland Timbers had shown a willingness to take on the Costa Rican international's $4.5 million salary after the two sides completed a trade in August 2015. Espindola was released from his contract by the New England Revolution this week.

Espindola's release means the forward is now free to play out the remainder of the 2016 season, and potentially beyond, as the Revs enter the offseason trying to replenish themselves for years to come.

The 32-year-old striker helped New England to consecutive Supporters' Shield seasons in 2014 and 2015, and has been on and off the field for D.C. FC over eight seasons. The Argentine will return to play in the United States and will still take up a transfer window with the club – but it's now open and will be open for a while, and could open up more opportunities for his native country.

""Fabian's a guy who has worked hard to be as successful and respected as he is,"" Garber continued. ""A guy who, despite being somewhat overlooked at times, has proven himself on and off the field for DC United for eight seasons. So yes, the decision was difficult to take.""

That might be the most important point in all of this, because while D.C. FC will continue to be at the club's home stadium, the player will see limited minutes for the Silverbacks, who will now be in the USL, or in the second division of the North American Soccer League. The club is expected to begin play in 2017, so this move is essentially another year with no roster spot to fill, so the club can focus on its academy for the young players it will be attracting"
"The six-year old boy was found dead in the family's home in Taunton, Massachusetts, on Sunday.

The boy's mother was arrested and charged with murder, according to WBZ-TV.

The boy's father, a 30-year-old man named Michael, was taken into police custody at the same time as his mother, but he was not charged with a crime, police said on Monday.

""We know that the father is cooperating with the investigation,"" Taunton police spokesman Lt. Michael Schneider told CBS Boston.

The boy's mother allegedly told police that she ""fell asleep"" when she heard a noise in her bedroom and that she found her son dead from a gunshot wound.

But police said the boy died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, WCBS-TV reported.

""He was just very sweet,"" neighbor Glenn Reed told the station. ""I mean, a little kid, he'd walk by the house every day. I mean, it's devastating.""

The boy's mother was found by police in an upstairs bedroom and police said they seized several firearms from the home.

The younger boy was a student at nearby Taunton High School, according to the school.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim and all those who knew him. We will support them during this time,"" Taunton High School said in a statement."

A Rockaway man punched, choked and choked the owner of a small business who allegedly refused to serve him, according to charges.

Police say the suspect came into the bodega on Staten Island Avenue at around 4:30 p.m. on Sunday and asked for a cup of coffee.

But the owner, identified as Mauricio Espinal, refused to serve the man because he was not a regular customer, police say.

When the man asked to go inside, the owner allegedly told him to leave, then punched him in the face, police say.

The man got up and fled the store, but Espinal followed him, and the suspect choked him, according to police.

Espinal, 59, of Rockaway, was charged with second-degree assault, resisting arrest and harassment. He was arraigned yesterday in Manhattan Supreme Court.

A lawyer for Espinal could not be reached for comment.

The bodega's owner told police that the man had a history of breaking other people's windows and, occasionally, threatening them, according to police.

He also said the man was known to have been seen walking around the neighborhood with a gun.

A woman who answered the phone at the bodega said that the owner is not there anymore, and that the shop is just a regular shop now.

The suspect's next court date was not immediately available.

"(Updated at 3:20 p.m.) A woman who was attacked by a group of teenagers in Union Square on Saturday night has died of her injuries, the Medical Examiner confirmed to NBC 4 New York on Monday.

The medical examiner's office said the victim, identified as 23-year-old Casandra Guerra of Brooklyn, died early Monday. Guerra was visiting New York from Texas, her brother, Victor Guerra-Ramirez, told NBC 4 New York.

The brothers said their sister was in serious condition after the attack, which took place around 10 p.m. on the sidewalk outside the Domino's Pizza at 12th Avenue and West 14th Street.

Victor Guerra-Ramirez said his sister was in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, but will likely remain in the ICU for several days. Victor Guerra-Ramirez said his sister is a stay-at-home mom and works as a escort.

In a statement Monday, Domino's Pizza CEO and Chairman Fred DeLuca said the company is ""deeply saddened by the loss of one of our own. Our sympathy goes out to the family and friends of Casandra Guerra.""

The girl's phone was found on the ground after the attack, and a witness told NBC 4 New York that the girl had been cut.

The NYPD said the incident took place in the area of 12th Avenue and West 14th Street.

The NYPD said the incident took place in the area of 12th Avenue and West 14th Street.

""This is a very difficult time for our entire team,"" said a statement from the NYPD. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague and friend.""

""The NYPD is by far the safest big city in America,"" said DeLuca in the statement. ""This is one of those rare instances where a tragedy occurred in a public place.""

Police said the incident was not a random act.

""We have no reason to believe that this is a random act of violence,"" said NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce. ""There is no indication that this was a hate crime.""

""The girl was stabbed many times,"" said one witness to NBC 4 New York. ""It looked like she was getting cut by a knife as she was coming down the stairs.""

The witness said the girl was at the restaurant with a group of girls.

""They were having a good time,"" said the witness. ""It's a shame, but she will be in heaven.""

The victim has been identified as a woman from Brooklyn, police said.

Anyone with information on the attack is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS."
"John Boehner speaks to the press on Capitol Hill on June 9, 2013. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday called for an end to President Obama's use of executive orders to sidestep Congress, citing the president's ""bizarre"" and ""immoral"" actions in the Middle East.

""The president has really gone off the rails on executive orders,"" Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""I'm not going to sit here and support a president who is abusing his authority.""

The Ohio Republican said Obama's refusal so far to use his executive power to overturn federal laws that would keep guns out of the hands of people convicted of domestic abuse or dealing drugs ""is just unfathomable to me.""

Boehner said the president has had ""mixed results"" when it comes to his executive power, as the president's attempts to delay Environmental Protection Agency rules have led to a legal challenge in court.

""That's the kind of action he should have taken in the first place. He's really put the American people in a bind,"" Boehner said. ""The president is abusing his authority.""

Boehner said he has told Obama that the House will not accept executive actions that bypass Congress.

""I'm not going to sit here and support a president who is abusing his authority, which is what he's doing,"" Boehner said. ""My message is clear, will not pass.""

Boehner said he's not the only Republican who thinks the president's actions are unconstitutional.

""I think there are a significant number of Republicans who get it,"" he said. ""The president has a history of abusing his authority. He's making a mess of things. He's trying to change United States law. He's circumventing Congress.""

"I believe that the majority of English-speakers are unaware of the fact that many of their ancestors had slaves. It was commonplace for a man to buy a Negro female, and sell a white girl to a father for a dollar, and there were many such transactions. Many of the slaves were indentured servants, and many had served their masters for many years.

On the other hand, there are some who seem to believe that English-speakers have a right to enslave Africans and other non-English-speakers.

In the Enlightenment, Christianity became a basis of government, and the laws of England were based on Christianity. The Enlightenment saw the idea of liberty as a human right. However, Christianity also created moral codes for the government and public officials, and these codes dictated how people should behave. These codes were known as laws.

Christianity was a religion, and Christianity imposed its morality on society. The laws of England were based on Christianity.

The laws of England had to comply with the laws of God. Although some people were born with the ability to understand the Bible, not all could or would. However, we can see that these laws were based on a religion, and they were enforced.

The laws of England were high and oppressive, but also very moral. And the majority of people believed in these laws.

However, the Christian laws were not based on the Bible, and they were not only enforced, but many Christians were put in prison for violating these laws.

The laws of England had to adhere to the moral codes of Christianity, and because of this, many Christians were put in jail for violating these laws. But Christianity also made them moral.

""Christianity"", as a religion, was also a high moral code. However, it was enforced on non-Christians as well. It is also important to note that this moral code was about God, and not on a person.

For example, the Bible stated that the Jews were in the ""land of Canaan"", and that they were to follow the laws of the land and the laws of God. But Christians weren't in the land of Canaan. They were in England. The Bible states that the Jews were to obey the laws of the land. But Christians were not in the land of England.

This contradiction was not only a contradiction to the Christian law, but to the moral code of Christianity.

This contradiction was not only a contradiction to the Christian law, but to the moral code of Christianity.

The Bible and Christian moral codes were both based on the same God, but the Bible was enforced upon non-Christians, while the moral code of Christianity was enforced upon Christians.

"The U.S. State Department issued a travel warning advising U.S. citizens in Honduras to avoid visiting the cities, beaches and tourist attractions during the Christmas break.

""Many U.S. citizens traveling to Honduras are concerned about the threat of violent crime,"" reads the travel warning issued Dec. 19.

""The vast majority of criminal elements focus on government corruption, which has resulted in a significant increase in extortion and kidnapping.

""U.S. citizens are cautioned against traveling if at all possible during the Christmas holidays.""

It urges American citizens to exercise caution in Honduras, saying there have been ""several attacks against Western tourists, including assaults and rapes.""

On Dec. 4 a woman accused of being kidnapped by three men on Dec. 11 was found safe and well, according to the U.S. Embassy.

The woman, who identified herself as a journalist, was found in the U.S. Consulate General in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.

Honduras has become a popular destination for many tourist due to the popularity of popular sports and festivals in the neighboring countries of Ecuador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and El Salvador."
"A new study shows that while the number of young people who think cohabiting relationships are better than marriage is on the rise, the majority of people still prefer marriage.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southern California, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University of Georgia and the University of Texas at Austin, surveyed more than 600 American college students and found that more than two-thirds of young people are in an union.

""While we're very happy to see more people in a committed relationship, it's important to remember that that's not always the best option,"" said Dr. Sara McLanahan, a professor at USC and the study's lead author.

""We found that people want to have a relationship and that they're happy to have a partner, but they're also looking for a committed relationship,"" McLanahan told ABCNews.com. ""They're looking for a kind of relationship that's more intimate, that can last a lifetime, that involves conversation, that involves emotional support.""

The study also found that while about half of people involved in cohabiting relationships say they prefer marriage, the majority of people still prefer a committed relationship.

""The vast majority of people who are in an exclusive relationship still want to be in a committed relationship,"" McLanahan said.

The study also found that the benefits that come with cohabitation are still more apparent than the drawbacks, with 91 percent of respondents saying the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

""The benefits far outweigh the disadvantages,"" McLanahan said.

The survey's other findings include:

– Only 22 percent of young adults who have ever been married feel married.

– Only 13 percent of people who have ever been married feel like they have a husband or wife.

– About half of people who have ever been married said they would be happier if they had a partner who was the same age or a few years younger.

– Only 10 percent of people who have ever been married say they are happy with their sex life.

McLanahan said the survey was conducted in April and May of 2013, so it's possible that the trend of more people choosing to cohabit may be reversing, but experts say that's unlikely.

""I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens in the next few years,"" McLanahan said. ""I think it's going to be a long term trend that's going to take a while to reverse. I think we're going to see continued declines in marriage, but I think we're also going to see more cohabitations."""
"The U.S. government has the right to monitor and spy on anyone, including American citizens, on the telephone communications of any person anywhere, regardless of whether they are suspected of a crime or not. The Fourth Amendment is clear: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.""

Although the U.S. government routinely invades the privacy of Americans without warrants, it is generally well-known that it does so. The government's frighteningly broad surveillance programs are also widely known. The NSA has a secret program that collects ""metadata"" on every phone call made in the U.S. except those made to or from the agency's own facilities. This program was disclosed in 2011 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The NSA has an even more expansive program for collecting and storing all domestic and international electronic communications.

But the government claims in court that it has no power to spy on individuals without warrants, no matter what the metadata says about them. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco recently affirmed that ruling. So, for example, when a suspect is arrested and charged with a crime, the government must provide a warrant before the government can spy on him or her.

Although the government has the right to spy on anyone, it is not allowed to spy on any person in any manner. No warrant is required to monitor the communications of an American citizen if he or she is not a suspect of a crime. But the government can spy on anyone, no matter who they are, who is not suspected of a crime.

The government can identify and punish anyone it wants. It can monitor the email and telephone communications of anyone, no matter what the metadata says. The government can spy on anyone, no matter what they say, with or without a warrant.

The government can target people based on any non-criminal conduct either because of their political beliefs, their associations, what they do for a living, or what they say in public. It can monitor any communications, even conversations with people who are not suspected of any criminal wrongdoing. The government can use the information it gathers to harass, silence, or punish political opponents. It can use the information it gathers to harass, silence, or punish anyone it wants.

"It's not every day that a major news outlet runs a story that doesn't fit the narrative. But on December 13, the Associated Press ran a story on the situation in Aleppo by one of their own, Arelis R. Hernández with a headline that's not only deceptive, but one that is designed to shame people into doing what is in their self-interest:

Aleppo - Airstrikes target Aleppo neighborhoods as US-Russia talks continue

The story was based on an interview with a Syrian official who said that US-Russia talks were working intensively toward a cease-fire in Aleppo. The key section of the story:

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by the Syrian government, said the talks were taking place at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We have to work with the Russians. We have to go back to the drawing board,"" he said. ""Everybody is trying to find a solution. Everybody is trying to find a way to end this war.""

So is the US and Russia working toward a cease-fire? No. The US and Russia are engaged in a proxy war to overthrow the Syrian government.

Hernández reports in the AP story that the US and Russia were ""actively discussing the possible introduction of a cease-fire and the delivery of humanitarian aid into Syria."" But Russia has been attacking civilians as part of its bombing campaign, and the Syrian government is not, in fact, involved in the talks.

The AP story points out that the US and Russia have been discussing various cease-fires in Syria, but none of them have been agreed upon, and none are likely to last:

The United States and Russia are engaged in a joint military campaign against Islamic State militants in Syria, but Russia has been carrying out airstrikes against the country's majority-Alawite communities in an effort to prop up President Bashar Assad, and the United States has been wary of the Russian strikes.

So why is the AP writing a story that is designed to shame people into accepting a ceasefire that the US and Russia are not going to hold?"
"I have found an update to the game that includes improved controller support and online features. The new version also includes a new campaign, which is the first one that has been developed for the Wii U. I have been playing this one for roughly half an hour, which is well over four hours worth of game. The new campaign introduces two new factions: The Templars and the Order of the Ebon Watch. The game is set in the period between the events of the first two game, and is said to focus more on historical events in order to create deeper and more compelling gameplay.

Multiplayer is still at a state where only a couple of maps are available due to the developer's inability to handle enough people. This is mostly due to the Wii U's limitations. However, I did have a blast playing a multiplayer game online with a friend that lives outside of Canada. It was great fun playing out the entire first campaign together. I think that if the game was released around the time of the original Wii's launch I would have probably tried playing with someone that lives a few hours away.

Overall, I give this game 5 out of 5 stars. It's definitely a must have for anyone that is a big gamer on the go, because the game is extremely fun and well developed. The only thing that is missing is online support, which is something that will likely be fixed in future updates."
"Towin' it in the Bay: A man in a small boat paddles over the Bay Bridge in San Francisco. The Bay Bridge opened in 1936 and closed in 2013 to make way for new highway bridges. The new, expanded bridge, scheduled to open in 2017, is set to be twice as wide as the previous one. (Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle)

It's the busiest bridge in the country, and that didn't stop the Bay Area from planning and building a third span for more than a century.

But one of the world's busiest bridges — the Bay Bridge — won't have its toll paid by Bay Area drivers after all, and instead will be paid by a toll facility in San Antonio, Texas.

As the Bay Area prepares to close its one-hour span on Sunday evening, many Bay Area residents will be relieved to learn that the state does pay for the tolls on the new span. But if for some reason they want to drive the new bridge at the same time as paying their toll in San Antonio, they'll have to take a detour.

The toll is one-way, but that hasn't stopped drivers from taking it. In fact, drivers have filled it and other one-way toll lanes with people from all over the Bay Area, particularly people planning to make a road trip to Austin, Texas.

More drivers were booked on the Bay Bridge one-way toll lane between San Antonio at night during the morning rush hour in July and early August, according to Bay Area toll authorities.

A truck from Bakersfield makes deliveries through the Bay Bridge toll lane in San Ramon, Calif. on July 30, 2013. (Photo: Eric Risberg/AP)

A Bay Area Council poll found that only about 24% of respondents had no plans to drive the new Bay Bridge or the toll lanes. But more than half of the Bay Area residents polled said they weren't ready to give up their cars, meaning a lot were already paying their tolls in San Antonio. The latest count has an estimated capacity of roughly 2 million cars a day at any time, according to the Bay Area toll authority.

With the closing of the Bay Bridge, San Antonio will now be free to carpool or use any other mode of transportation other than driving along the old bridge, where it is the busiest toll lane. So the toll revenue for San Antonio will be in addition to the state's share. That's part of a long-term plan for the local tolls to be the only source of revenue for the new Bay Bridge, according to officials.

And for now, the new bridge will open without tolls.

But in the coming months, the Bay Area will have to find new ways to share its transportation dollars with San Antonio.

BART officials confirmed the new bridge won't have tolls because it won't be used as"

"The first two times you take it at its word, you will not get nearly enough sleep. I didn't get it then. The first time was a disaster. I was still doped up from the previous night's drinking, and I had an unpleasant time. But the second time was better, because a few seconds after the needle was pulled, I started to feel sleepy. I remember thinking that the needle felt a bit smaller than I thought it was, or else it was too big. Either way, after taking it that once for the first time, I don't think I would ever consider taking it again. You never get the whole night's supply by taking it once. And when you don't get all of the night's supply, you don't sleep as well. I think that was really the reason it came back again.


The last thing I saw as I lay there in my room was a small gray shadow. It was a shadow of a person, but it didn't move. There was no sound, and as I stared at it, I could see nothing but darkness. So I lay there for quite a long while, thinking about all the other things I could not have ever dreamed about getting in a drug such as LSD. I thought, I am not gonna be on the street every night wondering if I am going to be picked up. I am not gonna come across a needle in my pocket or in the bedsheet I am sleeping on. I am not going to have to be on the verge of a breakdown every time I try to fall asleep. I am not going to have to be afraid of falling flat on my face every time I do sleep, or having the feeling that I am being invaded when I do sleep.


I was beginning to think that the best reason a person might use psychedelic drugs is to enhance the quality of his or her sleep. In my experience, psychedelic drug effects are not a positive thing; the effects are merely an enhancement of the quality of ordinary dreams. In my opinion, LSD should be looked at as a tranquilizer. It is certainly not a drug that enhances the quality of your sleep.


My last experience with LSD was on Valentine's Day of 1969. It was just a little past noon, and I was sitting in a park that was located just off Main Street in Berkeley, at the point between El Camino Avenue and Telegraph Avenue. The park was located on one side of a large, beautiful green park that was just across from the Berkeley campus.


I was sitting there in very good company, I think it might have been just about 10 people. I was not thinking about anything except for the fact that I had just had an excellent LSD experience. I was totally aware of my surroundings. I was not even wondering about anything -- my attention was completely focused on the space around me. I remember looking in the direction of the building that I was sitting in. It was a handsome"

"This week, a bipartisan group called the American Constitution Society will be convening in Washington, D.C., to discuss new legal challenges to Donald Trump's Muslim ban. After all, in its short existence, Trump's executive order has caused unprecedented confusion over how the U.S. should balance a government of laws with one of faith. And when the Supreme Court is considering whether the order is constitutional, it's likely to be the case that's at least as crucial as how the justices choose to handle it.

But if the president continues to fight, any future fights should hinge on whether his arguments are coherent. In particular, the president was wrong this week on the constitutional question whether his order violates the Establishment Clause. It turns out, he is right on the practical, if less lofty, one. And he is correct on his broader claim that the order makes America safe, despite its effect on thousands of lives.

Story Continued Below

The question involves some of the most basic tenets of our constitutional system, and a case that is arguably a landmark in the legal debate surrounding the president's authority to act alone on immigration matters.

""We have a duty to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorists, but radical Islamic terrorists are very different from other foreigners,"" Trump said in a statement to the nation this week. ""They come from different countries, they worship at different mosques, and they have a radically different ideology.""

It's true: Terrorists don't come from different countries, but from elsewhere.

They are ""people who subscribe, or sympathize, to the ideology of [ISIS],"" said Robert Chesney, a former federal prosecutor now with the law firm BakerHostetler. ""They're not all from the Middle East. They may be from Europe. They're from Eastern Europe.""

ISIS is, of course, the Islamic State.

So when Trump said he'd put the ""nation before religion,"" the idea was that he would do it by blocking the entry of Muslims into this country. ""It's our duty to protect the people of this country,"" he said, ""and the religion that we all love."""
"SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- After a three-year slide, offensive coordinator Greg Roman said he's feeling more confident about the 49ers' offense.

""I think it's definitely fun,"" Roman said Friday. ""But I think we're going in the right direction.""

The 49ers' offense has averaged 24.5 points per game this season, and the unit has scored at least 24 points in every game since Week 7. That includes a 34-point effort against the New Orleans Saints in Week 6.

The 49ers have scored at least 23 points in 11 games this season, their longest streak since the 2009 season. The 49ers have scored at least 23 points in 11 of their past 13 games, including five games with at least 27 points.

""I think we're a different team,"" quarterback Colin Kaepernick said. ""I think we're a different offense. I think we have a different mindset. We have a different swagger.""

Roman was asked if the 49ers' offensive success is due to the fact that they have more weapons than they used to or a change in philosophy.

""I think it's both,"" Roman said. ""We're obviously throwing the ball more. And we're also doing some different things on offense. We're doing some different things on defense. And so I think it's a combination of those two.""

The 49ers have dropped their past three games after winning four straight. They completed 24 of 46 passes for 350 yards with two interceptions in a 31-20 loss to the New York Giants.

Kaepernick completed just 22 of 42 passes for 203 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions in a 27-20 loss to the Arizona Cardinals.

""It's more about the mentality of the team,"" Kaepernick said after the team's recent losses. ""We just have to come out and play with more energy. We have to come out, play with more heart, play with more passion. We have to get better.""

Roman said he expects the 49ers to play harder Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs (0-2).

""I think the guys are really focused,"" Roman said. ""It's just the way we play. We play with a lot of energy, but we also play with a lot of heart. And I think we have to do both of those things."""

"The last time I looked at the state of California, it was experiencing its worst drought in a half century. But, a couple of months of rain have changed that. The drought has been replaced with a record-breaking, 10-year-long warmth.

At the top of the article is an article on the drought; I just wanted to point out how warm it's been. It's been as hot as it's been in 20 years, or more. That heat index includes the high of 94 in January. That heat index is an awful lot warmer than it was when the drought began.

Here's what I wrote about a similar thing here at WUWT. There's a really good way to describe this year, which I'll go into more detail about below:

I'm talking about the 10-year period between December 2003 and May 2012. That's the warmest 10-year period in California history, as measured using both the global land data and the state-specific temperature data. Not only that. The warmth of the decade was so extreme that the temperature was more than 100 degrees warmer than it has been in a decade, at least in California data. That record warmth is more than two times what the global average is and well above the previous warmest decade for the entire state, from 1901 through 1901.

So, what's in store for the future? A good place to start looking at that is the state of the ""normal"" temperature in California (which I've previously talked about), which doesn't mean much to the average person but does to scientists. That normal temperature, which doesn't change much even in the hottest years, was a bit above what it was before the record-breaking warmth. But the warm water that came with the record warmth also produced some bad stuff, which I will talk about in a day or two.

Meanwhile, the bad stuff comes from the ocean. The heat is not all at sea, as some have thought.

The ""normal"" (i.e. the average temperature for the state) averaged across the year is only 9.6C (47F). But that normal temperature was above its long term average of 10C (50F), which was set back in 1910. But that average doesn't show up at all in the ocean temperature records. In fact, since the last decade, the global average ocean temperature has been warming at a rate twice as fast as the land surface. In other words, since 2000, the world's oceans have been accumulating a greater amount of heat than the land surface – and that warming is not slowing down.

The heat-carrying water is being carried by warm, salty air and storm systems all along the west coast of the United States, and this is an example of some of the impacts. The warm water tends to be denser than the cooler water near the coast, and that has contributed to a"

"""As an engineer, I think we've got more in common than we could possibly come closer to disagreeing about. The idea is to look and see if there's anything that we can do to better promote this kind of thinking throughout the nation in all areas, not just in the military."" - John P. Holdren, President Obama's top science adviser

In a letter published Monday, a group of over 25 Nobel Prize-winning scientists and engineers denounced President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.

""We urge you to maintain the momentum created by the U.S. decision to withdraw and work constructively with the new administration,"" the letter reads. ""We believe it is important to take note of the positive steps taken by the new leadership of America at the end of the Obama administration to improve science and engineering cooperation.""


Among the signatories include three members of the Nobel Prize-winning U.S. National Academy of Sciences:

• Robert Laughlin, winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in physics for his groundbreaking work on superconductivity;

• Frank Wilczek, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has won 23 Nobel Prizes and a National Medal of Science;

• James Hansen, a professor emeritus from the Department of Earth System Science at Columbia University and winner of the 1997 Nobel Prize in chemistry;

• James Hansen was one of the authors of the 2007 ""Climategate"" emails, which purported to show an effort by scientists at the University of East Anglia and elsewhere to modify data that indicated that the world's atmosphere had been heating up for some time.

The letter was co-written by James Hansen, the ""father of global warming"" who is also featured in the documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth.""

The letter is addressed to Trump, and has been signed by several members of his administration including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. It also cites the letter from over two dozen Nobel Prize-winning physicists and engineering scientists, released earlier this week in which they denounced Trump's move, and criticized the media coverage of the decision.

A new poll released by the Pew Research Center is causing a stir this morning because it says that ""millennials are among the least religious generations in history."" The study found that ""more than six in 10 millennials say religion is or should be just something you do,"" while 57 percent say that ""religion is or should be important in my daily life.""

That's an 8 percent drop since 1980, when just 58 percent of millennials said that religion was or should be ""important in my daily life."" That number has dropped every single year since then.

Pew found that younger Jews (18- to 29-year-olds) and millennials in general (ages 18 to 34) were more likely to believe that religion is important.

For the most part, ""religious young people express their religious values less often than do those with older generations,"" the report said. For older Americans (the over-65s), less than 15 percent of those who were raised religious say religion is or should be important in their daily life. About four in 10 white mainline Protestants, black Protestants, and Catholics say religion is or should be a factor in their daily lives.

Among American Jews, for the most part the ""religious generation gap"" (as Pew defines it) between millennials and older Jews has narrowed. Nearly three-quarters of 18- to 29-year-olds were raised Jews. Only half of that group says church is important in their lives, which Pew says is among ""the lowest figures in U.S. religion history."" Nearly half of all Jews ages 65 and older say it's important in their daily lives.

The new poll also found that more American millennials identified with or identified with religions other than Christianity and Judaism than any previous generation. About one in three 18- to 29-year olds said they had no religious affiliation, up from 30 percent in 1960 and 23 percent one year before that. Another 16 percent considered themselves to be atheist. A quarter said they were agnostic."
"It's a long shot this was a prank, but some people on social media (and a few who live nearby) are having a hard time believing there were live gunshots on the north side of Columbus Tuesday evening.


They say someone shot up a car on North High Street behind J.W. Brown.


Some say a person fired two shots and a bullet struck a wall. Other people say a total of 10 shots were fired.


""I saw it all happen,"" said John Ellinger. ""That's why I was right here talking to you when I saw it.""


Ellinger said he was driving past the location when he heard about 10 shots.

The shots took place on the North High Street side of the building between North Sixth and North Seventh streets.

Columbus Police did respond to the scene and said an ambulance transported one victim.


The area was cordoned off with yellow tape for a couple hours.

The program, which is called ""Rapid Diagnostics for Rapid Deployment of Threats,"" is designed to analyze social media and other source material to determine if it contains information that could point to a terrorist threat.

""Rapid diagnostics will make it much more difficult for those who would do us harm to hide behind the anonymity of the Internet,"" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement.

The program will be run by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.

A DHS spokesperson told the Post that the department did not comment on ongoing or prospective law enforcement activities.

The program comes as the agency looks to expand its authority to share information with the private sector.

The agency recently floated the idea of using social media information to target a terrorist attack on U.S. soil.

""While there has been some concern among some that DHS' new shared data policy could enable DHS to benefit financially from information shared with companies for the purposes of homeland security, DHS continues to believe that it is in the best interest of the homeland to share information with the private sector with the goal of preventing acts of terrorism and preventing a terrorist attack,"" the spokesperson said.

The program was first announced in 2014 and was expected to be completed by the end of 2017.

The DHS spokesperson told the Post that the agency was ""still working through the details related to the implementation of this new program,"" but it ""will have a significant impact on border security."""
"The Guardian reports that the UK's ""Big Brother"" surveillance program has been used to target journalists and activists, while the United States has used it to target ""civil rights lawyers, human rights observers and lawyers who represent people in immigration court.""

The news comes as the Guardian reports that the US has spy programs that are used to ensure that ""the United States remains a safe haven from which to commit terrorist acts.""

The Guardian reports:

The files show that the US National Security Agency has operated a top-secret ""external collection system"" since 2006 that has been used to target the communications of at least seven journalists and human rights lawyers who have sued the government on behalf of their clients.

The journalists and human rights lawyers were targeted in part because the NSA considers them ""associated forces"" of al-Qaida. The NSA documents show that the agency has also used this system to target the communications of lawyers who represent people in immigration court.

The Guardian notes that the NSA used its surveillance programs to ""collect at least one US journalist's communications with the Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger.""

The Guardian notes that the documents released by Snowden do not show any evidence that the NSA targeted journalists or human rights workers for their work. However, the documents do show that some journalists and human rights workers were targeted.

Forty-seven-year-old former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling has been charged with violating the Espionage Act by informing the press about the NSA's domestic surveillance. Sterling, a former CIA operations officer, was charged last week with violating the Espionage Act for leaking details of a top-secret NSA surveillance program to the New York Times and the Washington Post.

On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that the Justice Department has charged one of its own, James Rosen, with violating the Espionage Act for having worked with an American journalist, Scott Shane, to review classified information from the NSA.

""Despite the fact that its chief purpose is to protect national security secrets, the NSA's mass surveillance programs have been widely criticized by civil libertarians as an intolerable breach of Americans' privacy rights,"" the Guardian writes. ""In response, the Obama administration has issued a series of executive orders and guidelines designed to curtail such activities.""

The government's surveillance programs have been criticized by the World Bank, the United Nations, Amnesty International, and the International Federation of Journalists.

The Guardian reports that the NSA's surveillance programs have been criticized by the World Bank, the United Nations, Amnesty International, and the International Federation of Journalists.

Citing an anonymous NSA official, the Guardian reports that the spying program is vital to the US fight against terrorism.

"The new U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) is seen during the ""Inaugural Exercises of the 7th Fleet"" conducted by South Korea's armed forces organized by the U.S. Navy in Busan, South Korea, June 23, 2017. Yonhap

The U.S. Navy's new carrier, the Gerald R. Ford, has not yet been formally commissioned by the U.S. Navy, but the U.S. Navy is set to celebrate the ship's arrival in the Pacific Ocean later this year.

The ship was commissioned by the U.S. Navy last October, but there was no official ceremony. The ship has been undergoing sea trials in Newport News, Virginia, since then, according to U.S. Navy.

The ship was formally commissioned by the U.S. Navy in Newport News, Virginia, on Oct. 17, 2017, aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS Porter (DDG 113) as part of the U.S. Navy's Annual Exercises, a series of test-firings and exercises held by the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet.

The Ford will be the first U.S. carrier since the USS Nimitz was decommissioned in 2012. In total, the U.S. Navy has six aircraft carriers, two of which are nuclear-powered, the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76) and the USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74).

This is the first time since the Nimitz was decommissioned that a U.S. Navy ship will take the reins as the U.S. Navy's primary aircraft carrier."
"I thought I had written a lot about the issue in general; mostly, it's just that we need to pay attention and understand that the very same thing that gets people to vote for a candidate could turn them against them just as quickly — or faster — if they are turned off by the way they vote.

And there are a number of issues to watch out for this presidential election. It's not about a third party candidate; it's about which candidate will help move us toward a brighter future.

Let me start out by saying that I personally believe it's going to be Hillary Clinton, who I have worked with for so long in the Senate. And I believe she understands how to bring people together.

That said, if Donald Trump becomes the nominee, you'll have a real choice — and it will be that much harder to vote for this country again. (AP Photo/John Locher)

On Tuesday, Trump was asked — a few days after he received his latest endorsement from the KKK — about making a deal with Hillary Clinton — who had just endorsed him — to make it look like they were working together. He didn't say that he wouldn't turn against her if he was unable to have a constructive relationship with her.

He never brought up what a Donald Trump-Clinton administration would do regarding the Islamic State, for instance, which is currently in control of territory totaling about one-third of Iraq and Syria.

Instead, he offered that he'd have a great relationship with Russia. And of course, the Republican nominee added, ""It would be good for the United States. It would be great for Russia.""

These statements, like many of his other assertions and promises, make it sound like a Trump-Clinton administration is what will make the United States safer. They won't. Hillary Clinton is an advocate of regime change, and so would be Donald Trump.

As the CIA explained in a report last summer, it was the overthrow of Libya's Qaddafi that enabled the Islamic State to take control of the country and grow to the size it now is:

""In the two years until the revolution, Libya's weak central government was unable to adequately counter the growing presence of armed groups in the country. These groups, which included many militias, grew in size and power under the government's absence and were increasingly radicalized. This allowed for the emergence of several extremist and violent Islamist groups, including Ansar al-Sharia (The Libyan Islamic Fighting Groups), Ansar Dine, Ajnad Shura Front (Desert Hawks Brigade), and Asala wa Al-Imam Ali (Soldiers of Islam Brigade), which were united by a common ideology of sectarianism, anti-Western sentiment, or both. The former Transitional National Council (TNC), which had been the government-in-exile following Qaddafi's fall, also played an important role in the growth of"
"A young man, still in his teens, lay bleeding and unconscious, his face covered in blood. The police and paramedics arrived within minutes, but he was already dead.

The scene was an alleyway behind a building in the 10200 block of North Cicero Avenue.

The man had been shot. His body lay on the sidewalk, and behind him lay a small pile of blood and bloody clothing.

A red truck was parked in the alleyway, with bullet holes in the windshield, a dent in the passenger side, and a bullet hole in the back bumper.

A small crowd gathered around the wounded man, who was carefully cradling a small sickle in one hand and a piece of paper in the other.

One woman sat next to the man, weeping.

""It's not fair,"" she said. ""They killed him for no reason.""

The man's name has not been released.

The shooting occurred at about 6 p.m. Tuesday, about two hours after a large fight in the area, police said.

A group of about 20 people were fighting behind the building when shots were fired, police said.

Police officers on the scene said they saw a dark-colored car speeding away from the area.

The man, who was shot in the head, was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he died.

The investigation is ongoing, police said.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Area North detectives at (312) 747-8518."
"Following the rousing reception that London's ""Oscar Nominee"" Best Picture winner The Revenant received, there's another film that may soon be on the radar of Oscar voters.

Lionsgate's The Founder, the true-life true-crime story about a murder mystery in the heart of Silicon Valley, is in the midst of its Oscar showcase, and the buzz is not only in the awards room.

The film, based on the true story of Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, has received some early buzz for its powerful performance by Daniel Kaluuya (The Brothers Grimsby) and his Oscar-nominated co-star Sharlto Copley (The Big Short), which includes Kaluuya's ""pristine"" performance as the man behind the most notorious Ugandan warlord.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is set to unveil its shortlist for the 2016 Oscar nominations on January 12, and if the buzz from The Founder is any indication, it's likely this could be the year Kaluuya finally makes his first Oscar nomination.

While the film's performance is remarkable, it's the subject matter that has people talking. The Founder tells the story of Thomas Bradley, a tech entrepreneur who witnesses the murder of his father, a field engineer who was killed in a car accident. Bradley's entire life changes when he begins working with his friend Robert Gallucci, a man who was also murdered. Bradley is determined to find the people responsible for his father's murder, and uses his stealthy technology to track down the killers.

The film also stars Stephen Lang (The Theory of Everything), Jean Smart (The Dark Knight Rises), Michael Stuhlbarg (The Wolverine), and Charlie Keatinge (Twin Peaks).

While Lionsgate's release date and release date for The Founder has not been set yet, the film is set for an October release date. Lionsgate's release schedule for this year includes Fox Searchlight's The Birth of a Nation on October 14, the Weinstein Co.'s The Big Short on November 8, and TWC's The Martian on December 5.

The Founder is directed by The Revenant's Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, from a screenplay by Robert Rodat. Based on the book by David Grann, The Founder stars Daniel Kaluuya, Sharlto Copley, Stephen Lang, Jean Smart, Michael Stuhlbarg, Charlie Keatinge, and Steve Carell.

"In this episode of The Sporkful podcast, host Elisabeth Hasselbeck talks with Sara Nelson, owner of The Sporkful blog, about her inspiration for creating a blog, writing on social justice topics and the power of blogging.


Guest: Sara Nelson

The Sporkful: Hey, Sara! Thanks so much for joining me to talk with you about your career!

Sara: I'm thrilled to be here, Elisabeth.

TS: This is so fun!

SN: I love being on this podcast! What can I give you for your website that no one else has?

SN: My writing has been really fun. I've been doing this for eight and a half years and I wrote a book and I don't plan on stopping. I'm also the owner of a podcast, the Sporkful blog, and it's one of my favorite things out there right now. I'm really thrilled about the way social media and the website have become such a part of the way we communicate. And the people who create our food-themed YouTube videos that we're doing every week, they've also become very active in social media. When I'm at the restaurant, I get to learn about other people's restaurant experiences, and they get to learn about mine. We just chat about what we love and what we hate and share ideas that we love as well. So I love that my life is like just a social experiment. It's just one way that I have a relationship with the world.

TS: We had a pretty huge social impact after we started blogging. But I think it's still hard to talk to your family and friends about what you've learned because they think you're crazy for thinking that there's still a good life outside of the house. Your parents, I think, know that you think the world is better than it is. And it's so great that you're kind of opening that up for them. You just want to make a world where everybody's happy.

SN: Yeah, that's why my website is called The Sporkful.

TS: The Sporkful.

SN: The Sporkful.

"The news is out on the site that the 2013-14 season will be the first season to feature a daily fantasy sports website.

""We're really excited about launching our daily fantasy sports service,"" said Joe DeSimone, COO and co-founder of FanDuel. ""We're committed to creating a product that is user friendly, that matches the need of the player while also providing the best value in terms of the amount of money a player can win.""

DeSimone said the site will feature daily fantasy basketball, baseball, football, basketball and hockey. It will also offer daily fantasy sports in other sports such as American football, NASCAR, boxing and hockey.

The site will allow players to play daily fantasy games for cash prizes. The site will also allow players to enter contests where they can win cash prizes.

The company will initially offer daily fantasy sports for football and basketball players, but the company will also offer fantasy sports for baseball, hockey, basketball and soccer players.

""We have the first ever daily fantasy sports sports contest on FanDuel,"" said DeSimone. ""We're looking forward to seeing how the community responds to the platform and what they do with it.""

DeSimone said the company will also offer contests for the draft and free agency of players.

FanDuel is headquartered in New York, New York with offices in Las Vegas and Charlotte, North Carolina. FanDuel has nearly 30 million members across all of its games.

The company received a $3.8 million investment from DraftKings, which is based in New York. The investment was made through DraftKings' parent company, DraftKings and SportsBetting.com, which is owned by Daily Fantasy Sports Network (DFS) and FanDuel.

DFS is a top growth company that has grown to more than $1.7 billion in revenue. DFS is a leader in the daily fantasy sports industry with an attractive product and a rapidly growing user base.

DFS and FanDuel are similar in many ways. DFS allows users to bet on games, but with more flexibility, including the ability to bet on teams and players, as well as the ability to bet on games and players. However, DFS offers a much wider selection of sports. DFS has a complete gaming directory of more than 2,000 sports and the largest sports betting site in the United States.

DFS and FanDuel are also similar in that both sites allow users to draft. However, DraftKings offers more extensive drafts and includes the ability to combine teams and players.

DFS also offers more exclusive contests that allow users to win cash prizes.

"The results of a recent study by researchers at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health show that the use of marijuana in adolescence is associated with early onset of psychosis and schizophrenia, which are two of the most common and severe psychotic disorders in the world.

The study has important public health implications, researchers say. In the United States, based on 2010 data, an estimated 25.5 million adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 are current users of marijuana, and 1.7 million are current users of other illicit drugs.

The authors of the study, published online in January in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin, sought to determine whether marijuana use, especially among adolescents, is associated with early psychosis and schizophrenia. They used data from the general population of more than 600,000 individuals in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).

""Our findings suggest that early onset of cannabis use is associated with a higher risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia,"" says lead researcher Dr. Matthew L. Winstock, associate professor of medicine at the Harvard Chan School.

Winstock and his colleagues analyzed data collected between 2001 and 2006 from participants in the NESARC study. The researchers found that the use of cannabis was associated with a first-episode psychosis, defined as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, among individuals between the ages of 15 and 24. They also found that a history of cannabis use was associated with a higher risk of developing schizophrenia and/or a psychotic disorder.

""Although the association between cannabis use and psychosis is consistent across the four studies included in this review,"" Winstock says, ""the studies included in this review did not control for potential confounders, which may have had a stronger impact on these associations than the cannabis itself.""

The researchers also found that the association between cannabis use and psychosis and schizophrenia persisted even after accounting for factors such as demographics, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, tobacco use, and other substance use.

""Our findings show that the association between cannabis use and psychosis and schizophrenia persists even after controlling for potential confounders,"" says lead researcher Dr. Michael J. Taffe, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.

""It is important to emphasize that this analysis is not suggesting that cannabis use causes psychosis or schizophrenia. Rather, we are suggesting that the association between cannabis use and psychosis and schizophrenia is driven by the prodromal effects of cannabis use on risk for psychosis and schizophrenia, and not by the cannabis itself,"" says Winstock.

""In the future, we hope to expand our analyses to include data from prospective studies with a larger sample size and more control for potential confounders,"" says Taffe.

"What a ridiculous comparison to make. The Conservatives are the party of the devil; the Liberal Democrats are the party of the Holy Ghost. I predict that in the next election a large majority of people will vote for the Conservatives; a similar majority or even majority of those who vote for the Greens, Lib Dems, and UUP will vote for the Labour Party.

You see, it is true that the Tories are the party that is seen as ""the party of the rich"", but this is because they are the most powerful party in the country. The moral of the story is that you cannot beat the party of the rich; you have to beat the party that they control. For the record, I am not saying the Tory Party or the Tory Government are the devil or the Holy Ghost; I am saying that there is no other party that can defeat them.

The fact is that the Liberal Democrats are the only party that can defeat the Tories and deliver a government that represents the interests of ordinary working people.

It is not surprising that this is a problem for the Conservatives. They have been in power for a lot longer than the Liberal Democrats have been in power. It's also not surprising that they have been in power for so long because the Labour Party has been in power for so long too.

The reason why Labour has been in power for so long is because they are the party of the workers. They are the party that represents the interests of the people. They are the party of the people and the only party that can defeat the Conservatives.

It is the people that Labour is running against. They are running against a Conservative Party that is the party of the rich, represented by very wealthy individuals.

The people of Britain have had enough of the Tory Party and the Tory Government. The people want politics that is honest and based on the interests of ordinary working people.

This is why I have decided to stand for the Labour leadership; I am doing this to represent the interests of ordinary working people. In the next few months it will be clear who has the stronger case to be the Labour leader.

I am running for the Labour Party because I believe that the Labour Party is the only party that can defeat the Tories. I believe that there is one party that can defeat the Tories and we are that party.

Tony Blair is a man who has done a lot of damage to the Labour Party and to the cause of working people. He has betrayed the working people of Britain.

I am running, for the Labour Party, because the Labour Party is the only party that can defeat the Tories. In the next few months it will be clear who has the stronger case to be the Labour leader."
"I've been watching this for some time - so many wonderful things about this movie. What I love about it is how it explores a bunch of different characters in different locations who get more developed as the story goes along, and how it never just feels like it's just a collection of cliches that just happen to have the character of Charlie Chaplin in them.

Charlie is an extremely intelligent guy. Charlie's life is very limited by the fact that he's a street performer, although in many ways he's not street. Most of our first impression with Charlie is of his performance in ""The Great Dictator."" That's a very well-known film so anyone could see it and be convinced he can be Charlie Chaplin, I guess. That's not true, but the movie has definitely made it into the legend of Charlie, and he's been made into a myth. Charlie has become a celebrity because of it - and he'll probably be making a lot more movies in the next 80 years.

This movie goes further with Charlie and some of his friends in different countries. One of the things that really drew me to Chaplin's work back in the day was how unpredictable he was and how he was able to just be at the right place at the right time to change the film, so all of those moments are there now, where there's more detail to it because we get more of a sense of Charlie having more interaction with the other characters in this world. That's one of the really beautiful things about this movie, the world is much more alive, and there's more of it to watch.

Another thing I really thought was beautiful is how the various scenes are all shot - the cinematography is just so amazing, it's almost like a collage. I just really love it, because all these different shots really work together. I think it's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. There are some other films that are visually stunning like ""The Godfather,"" and I liked ""The Great Dictator,"" but this one just does so much with just one camera. It's really beautiful to watch and it just adds to that feeling of magic.

But I like to think I am lucky to be a fan of these movies. It feels like I like to watch things in a particular way. I prefer things to be ""normal."" I prefer them to be normal so I can get to know people and feel like I know them better. I like it when it feels normal."
"I've been struggling with this problem for a few months and have finally decided to give up and get new equipment.

I bought a new Epson R-D1 digital camera with the original lens, a Nikon F4, and a Sigma 35mm 2.8 macro lens (I like the Epson lenses) and a few days ago I took a bunch of pictures with each and every one of them.

All of them were taken using the same lens, lens cap and shutter release.

I didn't get any sort of test with it, so I have no idea if my results are good or not.

So here are the pictures I took.

This is one of the first pictures that came out of the camera (I didn't have a bunch of pictures taken in front of the mirror, but I did try to record some test shots before I started the test).

I used the auto ISO settings, the newly introduced Epson RAW conversion software, and the LCD.

The black dot is the lens tip, the white dot is the sensor.

You can see that the sensor is quite small and not very reflective. I think it would be really hard to see in an image, and probably the biggest problem is the very short focusing distance of 2.8cm.

An Army veteran with the U.S. Air Force has filed a lawsuit against a Missouri driver who allegedly used a fake military ID to take a taxi ride, then refused to give him a ride home when he got home.

Craig Sager, who has served as a U.S. Air Force pilot for 18 years, says that he was attacked and robbed by an assailant who drove a cab on May 16th, and that the driver ""also displayed a fake military ID."" Sager says that when he got home he found his house had been broken into.

""I am a Navy veteran,"" Sager said. ""I have had my head smashed through a window. I have had smashed out teeth. I have had my car vandalized. I have had my house vandalized. I have been beaten up. I have been robbed. I have been assaulted. I have had to pay over $20,000 in medical bills. I have had to have my car stolen. I have had to have my home burglarized. I have been assaulted at my home. I have had my dog stolen.""

Sager's attorney, Tim Breen, told reporters that the incident occurred on a late night ride in a taxi, and that it was clear that the cab driver was not a veteran.

""He did not have a military or veteran's ID,"" Breen told reporters. ""I've seen an armed robber in a military uniform and I would say he was not in a military uniform in this case.""

Sager was able to identify the driver and file a complaint with the Missouri Department of Motor Vehicles. The Department of Motor Vehicles says that because Sager was a military veteran, the company that he works for is required to have a driver's license issued by the Missouri Department of Veterans Affairs.

According to the lawsuit, the driver was arrested by the local police and the Army, but the Army has yet to comment on the case.

"I think I have probably had the most successful business in the history of the world.

The average person has never heard of it.

You probably don't know that I am the owner.

That's okay.

It's good.

The tiny business is still going strong.

What is the secret to my success?

The secret is not to try to be successful.

You've heard the saying, ""You've got to be open to change.""

This is the most important part.

I'm not trying to be successful.

I'm not trying to be powerful.

I'm not trying to be famous.

I'm not trying to do anything impressive.

The only thing I'm trying to do is to be the best I can be.

The only thing I've ever wanted to do was to be the best I can be.

That's it.

I have never wanted to be something else.

The best I can be.

That's it.

Now, if you're not familiar with the phrase ""the best I can be,"" you're surely not alone.

It's a phrase that has been used so often that it has become cliché.

But it has its place in business.

I've learned that the best I can be may not be the best you can be.

And if you're not even close to being the best you can be, then you're going to have a hard time being the best you can be.

That's why I'm going to share three things that I've learned in the past 25 years that I believe will help you go about your business the best you can.

1: You have to be a mediocre person

The first thing you have to realize is that you're going to have to be mediocre.

If you don't make enough money, you can't really pay everyone.

If you don't work in the right way, you can't really get anything done.

If you don't spend enough time on your business, you can't really grow it.

If you don't have enough time, you can't really do anything.

But there's a second part to that.

That second part is that you can't be too passionate about your business.

You've heard the old expression, ""You can't have it all.""

But I've found that that's exactly what you're going to have to have if you want to be successful.

You can do everything you want to do, and you can do it well.

But if you try to do everything at once, you're going to get burned out and overwhelmed.

"""I don't think the (Balkans) question has been answered,"" Mr. Barzani said. ""It's (the) hands of the Americans and the Europeans. If they didn't do it, they shouldn't say it.""

The United States and the European Union have said they will not back the Kurdish independence referendum, though they have not said they will recognize the results. But they have said they will not enforce the Iraqi constitution and that the political entity known as Kurdistan is a separate entity.

The United States and its allies have been pressing the Iraqi government to grant international observers to the vote, but the Iraqi government has said that would be a violation of sovereignty and has suggested that the United Nations or the United States would do the job.

Mr. Barzani said Sunday that the United States and Western allies should ""draw their own conclusions"" from the referendum.

""What is happening is a violation of Iraq's sovereignty,"" he said. ""It has to be stopped. We will do what we have to do.""

The United States is widely expected to stay away from the referendum. The country's top counterterrorism official, John F. Kelly Jr., said last week that ""there is no credible threat to the United States or its interests,"" and the State Department has said the vote is not a security threat.

The United States did not send a Marine brigade to northern Iraq to train the Kurdish military, as some had expected, but Mr. Barzani said Sunday that the United States would send more advisers to the region.

He said he was ""in favor"" of a referendum in the Kurdish region, and ""not against"" it.

He said the referendum would help the people of Kurdistan understand their rights, and he said he believed the vote would be peaceful.

As the referendum approaches, the Iraqi government has sought to discredit it, with the prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, saying it was ""illegitimate.""

Mr. Barzani said the referendum would not affect the Kurds' efforts to organize a government in the Nineveh plain, where they are wrestling with Islamic State militants.

He said he believed the Iraqi government would try to divide the Kurds, and said that the referendum would help the Kurds to unify against the Islamic State.

If you're not familiar with The Last Unicorn, here's a short synopsis:

Millennia ago, the Unicorn was a hero. But when his village was destroyed by the Evil White Phoenixes, the Unicorn fled, abandoning his people. He rode off into the sky, never to be seen again.

But one day, in the depths of the forest, the Unicorn found a mysterious stone. The Unicorn knew that if he could return the stone to its rightful owner, the Unicorn would be free to live. And so the Unicorn set off with the stone … except that he can't ride a horse.

So the Unicorn makes his way through the forest to the edge of the forest, where he finds a small, crafty creature. ""This is it,"" the Unicorn tells the little creature, ""I am here to save you from death, and from the White Phoenixes, and from the evil that you have become. You must help me, and you must do what I say.""

And so the two friends set off down the forest road, and together, the Unicorn and the little creature ride off into the vast, beautiful, wild world. But as the Unicorn and the little creature journey, they discover many things, many dangers, many strange creatures, and many strange people, all of whom are trying to stop them and try to keep them from finding the stone.

They ride through the forest, and the forest is the place where they stop.

The Last Unicorn is a wonderful time-traveling story. It's a fairy tale of love and friendship, adventure and heroism, and it's a story that has to be read again and again. It's a story that tells you that no matter what you're faced with, no matter what it is that's holding you back, you can always find a way to overcome it.

And if you're wondering what it's like to be a Unicorn, well, it"
"The state Department of Education has said it is reviewing its relationship with K12 Inc., a Philadelphia-based company that runs for-profit schools.

The review came after The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Friday that the state was paying K12 Inc. more than $150 million a year.

""The Department is looking at its use of K12. Whether K12's use of a contract or contracts is appropriate, we won't prejudge,"" Department of Education spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said in an interview. ""K12's contract was renewed this year and we are in the process of reviewing what all terms are there.""

K12, formerly known as Washington Exelon/Penn Arts, operates more than 40 schools around the country. The Inquirer reported last month that the company raised its annual operating budget by 11 percent to $540 million last year at the same time the federal government, under President Donald Trump, took the first step to eliminate federal funding for so-called choice programs, including a $4.3 billion per year funding block grant.

State officials did not return calls from The Philadelphia paper seeking comment.

K12 is a spinoff of K12 Inc., a company that in the early 1990s was an affiliate of K12 Inc. K12's parent company now is known as the K12 Inc. company.

The federal Education Department awards grants to for-profit companies that run a particular school and can then use tax dollars to cover the costs of tuition. In fiscal year 2016 alone, K12 received $150 million as part of the Choice Scholarship Program, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In 2014, the program was expanded to cover thousands of private schools across the country. This year, K12 is set to receive about $150 million in grants from the federal program.

In December, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the Philly-based company received $955 million in its first three years of a grant from the state's public education fund, the Choice Scholarship program.

Critics said the arrangement was a gift because the state paid K12 so much money and in secret – all while the students at the company's for-profit school weren't being screened, according to state reports and interviews.

The Inquirer said that K12 Inc. had taken advantage of the program by ""hijacking"" it to get around federal rules and by marketing as schools that offered specialized training to students, which state lawmakers said was not true.

A K12 spokesman said at the time that the Philadelphia-based company was ""trying to grow a successful, diverse, and successful company.""

Hitt said that the ""state"" is referring to the Department of Education's relationship with K12 Inc.

""The purpose of reviewing K12 is to ensure that the federal taxpayer money that K12 receives through the state's Education Funding Formula grants"
"AUSTIN, Texas - A City Council approved a $40 billion bond ordinance Monday that will help fund a remake of the Texas Medical Center.

The bond measure includes $11.5 billion for the construction of the new hospital and related projects. It also includes $15 billion for the renovation of the existing medical center.

The medical center will be rebranded as The University of Texas Medical Branch as a part of the renovation.

Trinity Health will pay for the first three years of construction.

""This is a huge step forward for the City of Austin and its medical center and for the entire state of Texas,"" Gov. Greg Abbott said. ""The $40 billion bond package provides the greatest possible investment in our state's medical centers and will make it possible for the University of Texas Medical Branch to continue training the next generation of doctors and nurses.""

The proposal includes $600 million for the new medical school.

The medical center will be renamed The University of Texas Medical Branch. The renovation of the existing medical center will be called the Texas Medical Center Project.

""This bond package will make this project a reality and will provide the University of Texas Medical Branch with the resources and flexibility to secure the best location for the school in the country.""

The medical school will be located in the central campus of the university, which will also be home to the new The University of Texas Medical Branch campus.

The renovation of the existing medical center will be called the Texas Medical Center Project.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report, as we continue our conversation with investigative reporter Josh Fox. His new film, The Cove. His new documentary, The Cove.

Let's turn to what Fox was doing five years ago in the Brazilian Amazon, where he filmed what he called ""the largest seizure of Amazonian land in history."" The video begins with Fox, who speaks directly into the camera.

JOSH Fox: These are the people who are dying. The people who are dying are the indigenous people and the Brazilians who are doing this to these people. And we ask: Why are they doing this? And the answer is: Because they can. And they can do it, because they control the governments. And they can do it because they have all the money in the world.

AMY GOODMAN: That's Josh Fox, investigative journalist, filmmaker, speaking in 2007. In 2012, Fox appeared on Democracy Now!, where he discussed the film.

JOSH FOX: I was terrified. I think that on the surface, it looks terrible and it looks like it could have been better, but I was actually, in a way, relieved to be making the film. Because I know that even if it wasn't perfectly accurate, this is what I knew, and I knew that it was exactly what the people who are living there know, and I knew that I would be able to get into these interviews, and that they would talk to me, because I'd done so much of that before. So I was fortunate to get it right, and I was lucky to be able to get it made and to be able to have the film made.

AMY GOODMAN: That's Josh Fox, investigative journalist, filmmaker, talking in 2012. Now, we're joined here in the Democracy Now! studios. Josh Fox is an award-winning filmmaker. He spent five years in the Brazilian Amazon, most recently filming the largest seizure of Amazonian land in history. His new film, The Cove, is directed by his daughter Amy.

Amy Fox, welcome to Democracy Now! Talk about what you wanted to talk about and what Josh Fox wanted to talk about and your father.

AMY FOX: Well, our entire family has been made up of explorers. When we were children, our grandfather would take us in his canoe down to the Amazon River, and he would tell us stories about the Indians, the miners, the people who were trying to work the land. And we would always be fascinated by the amazing story of the Indians, and we always wanted to go there. And so, in the summer of 2010, when our father was just about to turn 60, he decided that he was going to go. And he didn't know that he was going to be coming into the Amazon. And"
"It was a great response from the public, and a great time to be in the position of being able to take on the great task of changing the face of the NHS in the UK.

It was a great response from the public, and a great time to be in the position of being able to take on the great task of changing the face of the NHS in the UK.

Royal College of Nursing president Kate Young announced the results of the poll as senior doctors warned that the NHS is on the verge of a crisis.

The survey, carried out by YouGov, found that nearly 1 in 7 (12%) of 1,000 people polled do not believe that more people should be able to see the GP at a walk-in service.

The number of health visitors attending A&E has dropped by 15% in 12 months, according to the NHS Confederation.

The survey also showed that 10% of people believe that the NHS is in crisis, with 29% believing that the health service is in good shape.

The figures came just a week after a survey by the NHS Confederation said that the NHS is in a ""state of acute crisis"" with one in seven GPs completing their rota, and the number of patients waiting for treatment has risen by 13% in a year.

The Association of General Practitioners (AOGP) has warned that ""the NHS is in crisis"", and warned that the NHS is on the verge of a ""fundamental change"" with A&E units becoming ""a thing of the past"".

Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the AOGP, said: ""The NHS is in crisis. The majority of GP rotas are now only in place because of the government's decision to scrap the GP contract in England.

""As a result of this, there will be one in seven GPs who will not be able to meet their needs.

""This is why AOGP has called on ministers to reconsider their decision and to restore the GP contract.

""Ministers must protect the NHS from a fundamental change in that it is not just about patient care, it's also about patients' safety and the quality of care they receive.""

A spokesman for the RCN said: ""The survey shows that there is a huge appetite for improved GP services.

""It shows that GP services in England are in crisis. We need to see the government get its act together and restore the GP contract.""

The survey of 1,000 people, carried out on Tuesday, was commissioned by the RCN and was carried out by YouGov."
"Hollywood actress Shailene Woodley was arrested for public intoxication, a misdemeanor, after police say she was found passed out in her hotel room at a Hollywood hotel on Saturday morning.

Police were called to a room at the Hollywood West Hollywood Hotel around 2:30 a.m. after being told by the hotel's manager that Woodley had been staying at the hotel overnight for personal reasons.

Woodley, 23, was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department, said Lt. Gary Kastelein.

According to Kastelein, two of Woodley's close friends were at the hotel and went to her room to check on her.

When the friends knocked on the hotel room door, Woodley was found sleeping in a bed with a glass of water on the floor, with her eyes closed. The room was in the same hallway as the hotel's bar, where Woodley often socializes.

An officer went into the hotel to wake Woodley and, once she opened her eyes, Woodley was arrested for public intoxication, according to Kastelein.

Woodley was booked into jail into Friday night and released shortly before 6 p.m. on $50 bail, according to court records.

An LAPD officer said Woodley was very responsive to officers' questions about what happened Saturday morning.

""She stated that she had gone to the bathroom as part of personal grooming and was 'drunk' and passed out on a couch,"" Kastelein wrote in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. ""She stated that she was taken to an out-of-town hotel room where she was not supposed to be.""

Woodley stars in the upcoming crime drama film ""Mile 22,"" about an FBI special agent's journey to track down an escaped convict who used a fake passport to travel to Cuba in 2007.

She is also known for playing Amanda Lindbergh on the original ""Lost"" TV series and Chloe Sevigny in ""Gone Girl."""
"The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), an anti-immigration advocacy group, has started a new campaign called ""Operation Rescue's National Day of Action"" to oppose Trump's executive orders on immigration, including the one on Thursday that would curb the flow of refugees.

The group said on its website that it's ""concerned"" about Trump's immigration policies and wants to ""act quickly to protect American families.""

""As the father of five American-born children, we are concerned about the safety of our nation,"" ACLJ President Todd Rutherford said in a statement.

Rutherford criticized the executive order as ""a direct assault on the law-abiding citizens who have been the backbone of our nation for decades, and a slap in the face of the millions of refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers who have made the United States their home.""

He said that ACLJ will be ""working with our partners to ensure every American has the opportunity to participate in our democracy.""

ACLJ has been a vocal opponent of the executive order, which Trump signed on Friday.

The group said all people who ""are without legal authorization—including those who are shielded by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program—are subject to deportation.""

The group also said that Trump is ""exploiting"" the tragedy in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a man crashed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.

""Trump's hateful rhetoric has been a distraction from the real issues at hand: the president's poorly vetted executive order on immigration, and the backlash against it,"" Rutherford said."

"Randall Boggs was a man of many talents, but the one he was best at was breaking into homes and stealing valuables.

He was also a master at disguising himself as a wealthy man so that he could break in.

Boggs, who died at age 96 on Wednesday, was one of the many cold cases in which the police in the early part of the 20th century failed to solve.

""I think he was a top-notch burglar,"" said retired Calgary Police officer Robert Powers, who worked on several cases as a detective.

Born in Calgary on July 20, 1914, Boggs was known as ""Bobby"" by his fellow officers.

""He was a very, very good burglar,"" said Powers. ""He was very smart. He was very crafty. He was a very intelligent man.""

He cultivated a reputation for being a master at disguising himself before he got into the homes of upper-middle class families.

He was skilled enough to do that even while living a relatively normal life as a married man in Calgary.

""It was more like his normal life,"" said Powers. ""So he was able to do that.""

Boggs became best known for the cases in which he broke into the homes of millionaire families in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

The first was the 1929 break-in of a home in the Glenmore area, where he took a knife and a set of golf clubs worth $500.

The second was the 1932 break-in at a home in the Parkhill area where he stole a $30,000 watch.

The third break-in was at a home in the Parkhill area in 1933. Boggs took a set of golf clubs and a set of jewels worth $150.

The fourth break-in was at a home in the Parkhill area in March of 1934. He took a set of golf clubs and a diamond ring worth $200.

The fifth break-in was at a home in the Parkhill area in April of 1934 where he stole a diamond ring worth $500.

The sixth break-in was at a home in the Parkhill area in October of 1934. He took a diamond ring worth $1,000.

The seventh break-in at a home in the Parkhill area was the eighth in the series. He took a diamond ring worth $1,000 and a set of golf clubs worth $1,000.

The ninth break-in happened at a home in the Parkhill area in January of 1935. He took a diamond ring worth $1,000.

The 10th break-in was at a home in the Parkhill area in February of 1935. He took a diamond ring worth $1,000.

"If you have a small and very active company, you are going to be paying some serious attention to your HR budget for the coming calendar year. So, in this post, we will take a deep dive into HR best practices that companies, large and small, should follow for 2018.

It's important to start with an overarching goal for your HR budget. While it's definitely useful to start paying attention to HR's budget at the time you begin your company's growth, it's also a good idea to take a step back. You should start by evaluating how you can make improvements that improve your company's performance and growth and then decide what the best changes to make are for your budget.

It's hard to put a fixed number for the absolute dollar amount that you would like your HR budget to be, particularly since our work is in progress. But we can provide some pointers on what changes to implement in each department, what kind of improvements to make to make it worth your while to invest your HR budget.

For this post, we recommend the following guidelines for your review and implementation:

Make a list of the department goals: What do people inside the org have they want, and how can you improve in that area? What is the organizational problem, and how can you take that into account? How does your company contribute to that? Look at the people: What skills and traits do other departments bring to the table, and how are you helping them thrive and reach those goals? It's helpful to think about the people who are employed by other departments too — like engineers or lawyers — but make sure that the departments contributing to the bottom line are identified as well.

"Finance, Industry and Trade Minister Bill Morneau was asked about the ongoing tax saga this week, after an opposition MP claimed the minister has yet to turn over documents about his department's role in advising and facilitating wealthy Canadians to evade billions in taxes.

""It has not been my practice to respond to hypothetical or speculative questions about an ongoing investigation,"" Morneau told the House.

""I have the respect of my colleagues and I intend to continue to work on behalf of middle-class Canadians who are struggling to pay their bills, their mortgages and to support their families and provide for their retirement.""

The MP for Vancouver Centre, Wayne Easter, raised the issue during Question Period during question period on Monday.

Bill Morneau, finance minister, says it's his practice not to respond to hypotheticals and speculative questions. (CBC)

Asked whether he will be complying with requests for documents from an Ontario judge, Easter said the minister has not yet responded to those letters and questions.

""The minister should provide the documents, the auditor should follow, and he should comply to his responsibilities,"" he said.

Easter's suggestion came in response to questions given as part of a motion put forth by Easter's NDP counterpart, MP Peggy Nash.

Nash wants to know whether the auditor-general's 2012 audit of Morneau Shepell, the company Morneau founded in 1972, ever looked into the company's alleged involvement in tax avoidance.

On Thursday, Conservative MP Kevin Sorenson took similar questions from Liberal MPs, raising a number of questions about Morneau's role in advising private equity and real estate firms to engage in ""unlawful, unethical and non-compliant tax avoidance,"" citing tax case documents related to wealthy Canadians with offshore accounts.

The Toronto realtor asked if Morneau consulted with his ethics officer before signing a ""non-disclosure agreement"" with the firm.

'A lot of things are not known': Morneau

In response to the queries, Morneau told reporters ""a lot of things are not known.""

Morneau said his department followed all its rules and regulations, but added the department ""makes no apologies,"" for its efforts to collect as much tax as possible from Canadian taxpayers.

""I believe that our government should be commended for its commitment to supporting middle-class families and the success of our small businesses,"" he told reporters.

​""Our government is committed to working with the CRA to collect as much tax as possible from Canadian taxpayers,"" Morneau added. ""That approach has resulted in the largest ever tax collection by CRA Canada for any tax year, over $11 billion.""

Tax reform is a priority for the opposition parties, with opposition calls growing louder following the Liberal party's controversial tax reform initiative unveiled Tuesday.

But Liberal MPs said the measures won't affect the vast majority of Canadians and that the"
"LONDON (Reuters) - A British banking regulator said it was considering whether to take action against Lloyds Banking Group for issuing fake mortgage bonds to raise funds to support the financial crisis, the BBC reported on Thursday.

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) said on Thursday it had received a complaint about the issue, which the BBC said was a year old.

""The FSA's investigations team has been looking into this issue,"" it said in a statement. ""We will consider whether to take action if there is sufficient evidence.""

The BBC said the issue involved bonds known as ""Hedging Hedges"", launched in September 2008 to support the financial sector during the global financial crisis.

Lloyds said in response that the bonds were issued for a specific purpose and were not intended to raise funds for other purposes.

""We are committed to maintaining high standards of integrity at all times,"" it said.

The problems with the bonds came to light last month when the head of the FSA's independent panel of senior bankers said he was investigating ""serious concerns"" about the bonds and their sale.

""I am not aware of any evidence that these bonds were not properly issued and sold, but it is important to note that the FCA and the FSA have not found any evidence to this effect,"" said Simon Derrick, chair of the FSA's independent panel of senior bankers.

""However the investigation is now under way and we are seeking to establish the full facts.""

"The F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, first flown in 2006, has been undergoing a $2.6 billion upgrade since July 2010.

WASHINGTON — The Air Force has been testing a new engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that could provide a significant boost in range, according to a recent report.

The Air Force is considering developing a new engine called a P&W (Pentagon Engine) F136 for the F-35B, the Air Force Times reported Wednesday, citing ""top defense officials.""

The P&W F136 engine is a ""new-generation turbofan with an enhanced bypass ratio,"" the Air Force Times reported, adding that the engine could provide a range of more than 6,000 nautical miles.

The Air Force is seeking a $2.6 billion contract to update the F-35B's engine, the Air Force Times reported. The USAF Global Strike Command also is in the process of requesting the upgrade.

"White House hopeful Hillary Clinton, who is reportedly close to hiring David Brock, who created the pro-Clinton group Media Matters, as her campaign's chief political strategist, is taking aim at the billionaire Koch brothers.

The Democratic frontrunner has hired the brother of Media Matters founder David Brock to lead her political operation.

""This may be the most important hire of the campaign,"" Roger Stone, a longtime Clinton confidant and a longtime Republican operative, told The Daily Caller. ""He has been a major force in speaking out against the Koch brothers and their extreme agenda.""

Stone has previously accused the Koch brothers of ""buying"" the Republican party.

""This is a huge deal,"" Stone told TheDC about the hiring. ""The Koch brothers are part of the problem and a part of the solution. The best example of the Kochs buying the Republican party is the conservative movement. What we have is a Republican party that has moved much further to the right under the Kochs' influence. This is an attempt to bring the party back to center.""

Brock will reportedly handle media strategy and other duties, according to Politico. In addition, Brock will also act as a liaison to the liberal media.

Brock, who previously ran liberal groups like Media Matters, has become a fixture in the Democratic Party. He has worked for Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

Brock's Media Matters, founded in 2006, focuses on ""corporate malfeasance."" Brock ""has become one of the leading voices for progressive causes on television, in print and on the Web,"" according to Politico.

Politico writes that Brock ""has been a driving force in the Republicans' 'war on women' and other progressive causes, using his vast network of allies to pressure corporations and lawmakers to adopt progressive policies.""

Brock, who is married to Elizabeth Brock, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, is also a peer at the progressive think tank Center for American Progress.

""He has been a major force in speaking out against the Koch brothers and their extreme agenda,"" Stone told TheDC. ""He has a lot of credibility among progressives.""

Media Matters is a particularly significant target for Clinton because of the group's role in attacking Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Brock spent months attacking Trump, especially over his comments about women.

In a February 3 blog post, Brock said that ""Trump's comments about women are appalling and disqualifying.""

""Donald Trump is the most notorious misogynist in the Republican Party, and he is running for president of the United States,"" Brock wrote. ""His treatment of women is so bad that it is difficult to believe that they are part of a carefully planned 'performance' for his campaign. His statements on women are so appalling that they are actually dangerous. His recent comments about Megyn Kelly, the Fox"
"Voters have approved a referendum to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the Ukrainian conflict.

The vote was held in the country's western region of Crimea, where residents overwhelmingly backed joining Russia.

""The people of Crimea, in the referendum held on March 16, have adopted an initiative to withdraw from Ukraine and to become part of the Russian Federation,"" a statement from the Crimean parliament said.

The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said that Crimea's secession would be a ""grave provocation"" to Ukraine.

The referendum - originally planned for March 16 - was called off after a surge in turnout."
"The last year has been quite the eventful one for the S&P 500. Just as we predicted, the S&P 500 is up 10.49% this year, and the index has rallied on every single day of 2017.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite are both up 11.73% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 is up 12.33%.

That's an impressive performance. However, it's not all good news.

There are a few things that could hamper the S&P 500's lofty performance.

There are two reasons why the S&P 500 may be underperforming:

It is not growing as fast as it used to. The S&P 500's average return since 1985 has been just under 5%. That's hardly spectacular and, when factoring in inflation, it's barely better than a 5% return on stocks in the late 1990s.

The S&P 500's average return since 1985 has been just under 5%. That's hardly spectacular and, when factoring in inflation, it's barely better than a 5% return on stocks in the late 1990s. It's facing a very difficult environment. Smart investors should be wary that the global economy is not growing as fast as it did a few years ago. Oil prices are starting to climb again, and the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December.

If you're looking for the best portfolio for investors, you can't go wrong with the S&P 500. However, if you're looking for the best investment vehicle for your portfolio, you'd be wise to look elsewhere."

"[There was a video here]

Last week, a judge had to recuse himself from a case in which the law on what a woman can and cannot wear was on trial at a Florida courtroom. In this video from 2013, Jessica Simpson, star of That '70s Show, defends her right to feel naked in public, with an accompanying photo from the show's ""Naked Ladies"" calendar.

""I feel like my body is just like everybody else's,"" Simpson says. ""Like no one is telling me, 'You've got to cover up.' I get that. I get everything. I'm a woman.""

Simpson wore a black leotard — a la the 1950s version — which, of course, led to more online outrage than the video itself.

""Is there anything more offensive than to see a black person put on leotard and wear a burqa?"" one person wrote.

Simpson responded: ""Let me ask you something. If I wore this leotard to a job interview, would you be offended? If I dressed like this at a wedding would you be offended?""

There was also some Twitter drama in the wake of the video.

""Is there anything more dangerous than a woman in a leotard doing a jig in the hallway with someone in a tanktop?"" wrote @jimboofar.

And then there was @lurkin_c.

""Lorraine Lorraine, you may look good on paper, but at my club that hasn't ever made it past my first manager,"" she wrote. ""And yes, I'm aware that you can be seen anywhere, wearing anything. But at a club where the women only wear underwear in the club, we are told we have to hide. That is all. And it takes two to tango and a few more to tango better.""

The video has garnered over 500,000 views, and has generated the usual mix of comments. Many are incredulous that Simpson would be upset about being nude in public. Here's Simpson on a 2009 episode:

But another thing to keep in mind, given how it's used in the past — when the woman's body has the potential to be seen and used to objectify — is that this isn't even a new idea.

""We're always going to talk about what we can wear. We wear pants. There really isn't anything about a woman that we wouldn't show to our advantage,"" says Lisa Bloom, president of The Legal Institute, the nonprofit women's rights organization that filed a class-action suit against Playboy in 1983 to have the nudity ruling overturned.

And the reason why most of Hollywood would find this offensive isn't just the idea that they can be seen naked. It's also the idea that they can objectify others by objectifying them. That's why nude"
"The U.S. Supreme Court declined Tuesday to hear an appeal of a Virginia judge who refused to recuse herself from a case involving President Trump's daughter, Ivanka.

Judge Marylin Rogers, a Republican appointee, was asked to recuse herself from the case after a Virginia State Police trooper working with the Secret Service brought new allegations of misconduct against the president's daughter.

Rogers said she had been asked to recuse herself based on her relationship with the president's ex-wife, Ivana Trump. But the Supreme Court on Tuesday denied both requests, saying her handling of the case did not give ""cause for judicial recusal based on her current or prior relationship with the litigants.""

As to the new allegations of misconduct, the court said Rogers ""was not the intended beneficiary of the investigation in this case and could not have prejudged the outcome as a result of her relationship with Ivana."""
"New York state is a place that demands privacy. When I'm in my office, I don't want the camera recording. I'm not alone, either. In our homes and our offices, we all know the dangers of the surveillance state.

Privacy is the cornerstone of democracy. It's a value that should be at the center of new legislative proposals to reform New York's surveillance laws, because the new measures—called the Surveillance Self-Defense Act and the Right to Know Act—would effectively legalize the state's dragnet surveillance of our lives.

The proposed laws make it a crime to record someone without their consent.

Last month, New York's governor signed into law legislation (S1033) that makes recording private conversations without the consent of one's conversation partner a crime punishable by up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine. The law will go into effect on November 19.

The Right to Know Act would also make recording, publishing or distributing recordings of private conversations a criminal act punishable by up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines. Under S1033, people who record conversations without the consent of all parties may be liable for ""a civil penalty of $5,000 for each invasion of privacy.""

The new measures come in response to a lawsuit filed late last year by a Bronx photographer, who alleged that New York state police had illegally placed a GPS tracker on her car. The police have said the device was necessary to investigate the case of a drug dealer who drove past the photographer while she was photographing her home, prompting the investigation to focus on her vehicle.

In addition to being dangerous and intrusive, the new laws would violate our right to privacy by making it much easier for police to prosecute individuals they find engaged in what the authorities consider criminal behavior.

The new laws will be a major victory for those who have long fought back against overzealous police spying on their every move. After the 2011 shooting of NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo, for example, community activists nationwide organized to protect citizens from unlawful surveillance.

New York state activists are now working to prevent the city from using its massive surveillance systems. It isn't enough to prevent the state from tracking our every move. The new measures would make it unlawful for residents of New York state to record, film, or publish private conversations.

New York has recently established an independent Privacy Commissioner whose sole job is to advise the governor on how to reform New York's surveillance laws.

If the state is truly serious about ending surveillance, it should immediately implement these new, stronger laws.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is one of the groups that came out strongly against these new laws this year. One reason the organization supports stronger rules is its longstanding legal battle against the NYPD for spying on activists through its surveillance program known as ""Demographics Unit."" The Electronic Frontier Foundation and other groups were successful last year"
"In this May 20, 2013, photo, a rhino is seen at the Davis Bros. Wildlife Ranch in Santa Cruz, Calif. California is on track to become the third state, after Montana and Wyoming, to ban the sale of rhino horns, after Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation Tuesday, Feb. 24, 2014, to ban the sale of the horns in the state. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)

SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) — Long a symbol of wealth and status in Asia, rhinoceros horns have fallen out of favor in many countries as they have been linked to cancer, dementia and other ailments. But in California, which is on track to become the third state, after Montana and Wyoming, to ban the sale of rhino horns, the horns are being increasingly seen as a status symbol.

In Santa Cruz, California, visitors can buy rhino horns for $100 a piece — about $2,000 a pound — or powder that is supposed to be made into a rhinoceros horn powder that sells for about $10. The horns are an integral part of the Asian trade and are coveted for their shape, size and the ability to boost a person's stature.

Rhino horn powder is often sold in powder rooms at Asian restaurants, where it is mixed with salt and other substances to make it more palatable.

""It's getting pretty trendy, like a trendy unicorn,"" said Justin Robbins, a 19-year-old with a nearby wine shop that has been selling rhino horn powder for the past year.

The horns are a common sight in the U.S. southeast, especially in Georgia and South Carolina, where rhinos are mostly present. But in California where the horn is illegal, it is becoming increasingly popular.

Earlier this year, park officials in Santa Cruz, a city of about 60,000, started a rhino herd vaccination program in order to prevent poaching. The animals were put in a pen that held about 100.

""One of the nicest things about living here is that there's a lot of carnivores that live here,"" said Becky Yee, who works at a pet store and has been selling rhino horn powder and is planning to open a rhino horn salon.

That's because the horns sell well in Asia, where they are valued for use in traditional medicine and have been used to treat everything from hangovers to AIDS to cancer.

Santa Cruz is one of the oldest cities in the U.S. and is known for its historic architecture, including the Santa Cruz Tower, the tallest building in California.

At one point, the city had about 200 rhinos. But over the past decade, about half of the park's rhinos have been poached.

California is one of the most populous states in the nation, with more than 38 million people"
"In the early days of the Vietnam War, a United States Navy plane was shot down over North Vietnam. The pilot survived, but his aircraft was destroyed, and he would never see it again.

Twenty years after his plane was shot down and his crewmembers were killed, the pilot returned to the area, and, with just a small knife, dug through a massive pile of debris to retrieve his aircraft.

The plane's wreckage was found in November 1966. It had been covered in a thick layer of concrete, which the pilot had to cut with a small knife to release the aircraft.

And it was recovered before dawn on May 1, 1997.

For the pilot, it was an emotional day, but he knew he had to get the plane back.

""Because it was a friend's plane, and we were friends, and I felt sort of responsibility to get it back,"" Sean McIntyre said.

McIntyre was born in New Zealand and grew up in Texas, but he's been living in Hawaii for the past thirty years.

""I found out that I was the only pilot to ever come out of that aircraft,"" McIntyre said.

But there are no un-named pilots on the record who have flown out of the North Vietnam Airport, and there are no records that show how many planes have been shot down there in the past.

McIntyre was part of a group of people who came down to the airport to get the plane back.

""I've been down there a couple times,"" McIntyre said. ""I've been down there with 35 other people, and we've walked up the hill, we've walked down the hill, we've walked back up the hill, and we've climbed back down the hill.""

Steve Andersen, the airport's manager, said that he was told that a plane had been shot down on May 1, 1966. But he's never been able to find a record of who shot down the plane.

In the meantime, McIntyre has made the long walk over the hills with his crewmates. He only recently decided to take the plane out of storage.

""It's all about the story, and it's all about the guy, and it's the story of a plane that was shot down,"" McIntyre said. ""And I think it's the best story is the most important thing.""

McIntyre is hoping to travel to North Vietnam with his friend Andy Roberts, the pilot of the plane that was shot down.

""He's been there twice before, and he's been there with the first two people we've heard from,"" McIntyre said.

McIntyre said he'll be bringing his plane back to Hawaii for the first time in decades.

"Image copyright AFP Image caption The government says the ban is designed to protect public health

Pakistan has banned meat and milk from cattle, goats and sheep for a week after the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a cow tested positive for the disease at a slaughterhouse.

The government said a government laboratory had confirmed the case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a fatal disease, at SSP Meat.

The ban is meant to protect public health, the health ministry said.

Authorities in two other provinces had announced similar bans following the first confirmed case earlier this year.

The WHO says the disease is fatal in about two-thirds of people who contract it.

But it remains unclear exactly what causes the disease, which primarily affects the brain and spinal cord of the animal, killing most within a week.

Image copyright AP Image caption There is no cure for the neurodegenerative disease

Dr Safdar Hasan, former president pro tempore of the National Assembly, said such a ban was ""appropriate"".

""It will go some way in reducing risks of animal diseases in the country,"" he told the BBC.

However, he warned it could affect the dairy sector, as the animal slaughtered for milk and meat is typically vaccinated against the disease.

On Monday, the Punjab government had banned the consumption of beef in the province's capital city, Lahore.

The ban will remain in place for eight weeks as it awaits lab results on one cow tested positive for the disease, the government said.

In May 2013, the Pakistani government banned the sale of cattle for slaughter for a month to check the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) after the first known case of the disease in cattle was recorded in a farmer from the same area.

An animal rights group has since called on the government to ban cattle slaughter in Pakistan as a means of controlling the disease.

But on Saturday, the interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, insisted that it did not need a nationwide ban on beef.

""The health and food security of citizens... should be the top priority,"" Mr Nisar said. ""The issue should be taken care of by the state, by the provinces and by the individuals.""

But he said the government was working with scientists and others to help the Pakistani dairy sector in combating the disease, which has spread in the past two decades in countries like India and Bangladesh."
"The remarkable story of a man who really, really, really loved his child.

A few days ago I posted a link to a video on YouTube. It was a parody of a YouTube video. It was a parody of a YouTube video, because, well, it's not really a parody of anything, it's just silly. This short video features a man who really, really loves his child. It's a heartwarming scene, but it's also a story that deserves to be told.

I'm talking about Paul Holmes of a town called Nampa, Idaho. He's 87 years old and has been a father for 59 years. He's never married. He doesn't have kids of his own.

But these days, Paul Holmes is not just a doting dad. He's a martyr.

Paul Holmes is a hero.

It's true. He's got a heart of gold. He's kind and generous to his friends, family, and neighbors. He has a heart of gold. He doesn't ask for anything, and he never asks for anything in return.

"""On the question of whether the United States should go to war with Iraq, the overwhelming majority of US citizens believe that the US should not go to war with Iraq, but rather should do what is necessary to confront Saddam Hussein's threats to the US and the world,"" said a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll.

So, with the US in fact engaged in the Iraq War, and US citizens very strongly opposed to this war, why is this position still so much a part of the US political discourse?

Because to say that the US should not go to war in Iraq is to say that Iraq is not a threat to the US, and therefore the US should not engage in the Iraq War.

The US has been engaged in this war since September 11, 2001, when the US invaded and occupied Iraq. Since then, over a hundred thousand Iraqis have been killed, millions have been displaced, and the US committed a war crime by deliberately targeting civilians. The US has been fighting this war for over a decade.

The reason the US has been engaged in this war for so long is because the US is a global superpower. The US can do whatever it wants to do. To say that the US should not go to war with Iraq is to say that the US is not a global superpower, it is not a ""great power,"" and therefore the US should not engage in this war.

To say that Iraq is not a threat to the US is to say that the US does not have a global strategic interest in Iraq. This is how I have described the US position to many people: it is indistinguishable from saying that Iraq is not a threat to the US.

This is why the US has been engaged in this war for so long, and why it remains so dominant in US politics. The US is not a global strategic interest, it is only a global power. It has no strategic interests whatsoever in Iraq. And it is not willing to do anything to defend its interests in Iraq, or anywhere else. This is why the US is still engaged in this war.

To say that this war is a ""mistake"" is to say that it is not a strategic mistake. The US is not going to withdraw from Iraq. It is not going to give back all its weapons of mass destruction. It is not going to expel Saddam Hussein. It is going to do whatever it wants to do.

To say that the Iraq War is not a strategic mistake is to say that it is not a mistake to go to war in Iraq.

To say that the Iraq War is a strategic mistake is to say that it is not a mistake to engage in the Iraq War.

To say that it is not a strategic mistake to engage in the Iraq War is to say that the US is not a global power, it is not a ""great power,"" and therefore the US should not engage in this war."
"""A number of people are saying this was a radical Islamic attack,"" Donald Trump told a crowd at a rally in Derry, New Hampshire, on Friday night. ""And I have to say, I don't know if it's a radical Islamic attack, but we have to be sure. Because I don't want to say we're going in, we're going in, based on some guy in a mosque who has something about wanting to kill us.""

""We have to be smart,"" he continued. ""And we have to be vigilant.""

Trump does not appear to understand that the poll numbers he cited — which show that roughly one-in-five Americans (22 percent) think the shooting was ""an act of terrorism"" — do not establish a trend that justifies a ""surge"" of surveillance and monitoring.

Instead, they show that the public is far more likely to say the shooting was a hate crime than to say it was a violent attack.

In fact, according to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll released on Monday, only 15 percent of Americans said the shooting ""was not a terrorist attack at all,"" while a full 50 percent said it was a ""terrorist attack."" A full 47 percent said the shooting was ""not driven by Islamic extremism."" It's easy to see why Trump would be so eager to assert that the shooting was motivated by Islamic radicalism.

However, Trump's claim about the poll numbers seems to be based on a false premise. The fact is that the poll numbers he cited — which show that roughly one-in-five Americans think the shooting was ""an act of terrorism"" — do not establish a trend that justifies a ""surge"" of surveillance and monitoring.

The reality is that the public is far more likely to say the shooting was a hate crime than to say it was a violent attack.

A YouGov poll released on Monday found that 49 percent of Americans say the shooting was driven by anti-Muslim bias, while 24 percent attribute the attack to anti-immigrant bias. (More than half of Americans, though, think the attack was motivated by anti-Hispanic bias.)

While it is true that these numbers show that a majority of Americans think the attack was motivated by anti-Muslim bias, Trump is mischaracterizing the results. The fact is that more Americans think the shooting was driven by anti-immigrant bias than by anti-Muslim bias.

In fact, a YouGov poll released on Monday found that 49 percent of Americans say the shooting was driven by anti-immigrant bias, while 24 percent attribute the attack to anti-Hispanic bias. (More than half of Americans, though, think the attack was motivated by anti-Hispanic bias.)

When you look at this more closely, though, the numbers don't actually support Trump's contention that the shooting was a hate crime. More than one-third of Americans (36 percent"

The paper also includes a picture of a woman's bare back. It is accompanied by the caption: ""Can the Left win? There's a problem in the Labour Party.""

The Sun's website was swiftly taken down by its readers after an overwhelming number of people flooded to the site to condemn the front page.

In the past, the paper has published front pages containing fake news stories including a story about a Tory MP who had an affair with a teenager and another that claimed an anti-Semitic joke about a dead pig had been made by a Tory MP.

"The NBA is expected to vote on a rule change that would change the way games are officiated, according to league sources.

The new rule would allow for a referee to make an ""embellishment"" call to the team shooting a free throw instead of calling a technical foul, NBA sources told ESPN.com.

The rule change would allow for an assistant coach to raise a hand to signal, ""Illegal shot."" Instead of the official signaling ""technical"" and then announcing, ""The ball has been ruled inbounds,"" the assistant coach would signal ""Illegal shot.""

The rule change would be enacted as part of a rule change at the beginning of the 2011-12 season.

In the past, a technical foul was called when the ball was moved out of bounds, but officials have not changed the rules to allow for the kind of clarification that would come with the new rule.

The NBA has not specified which players would be subject to the change. DraftExpress.com reported that the NBA is expected to increase the amount of free throws that can be made from the line.

According to the website, the league is also expected to raise the size of the line from 2 feet to 3 feet.

On Tuesday, the NBA shortened the minimum length of time a player can be ejected from games to four minutes while also tightening the rules regarding timeouts.

"Pumpkin Carving is the act of carving pumpkins into a recognizable shape. It takes a lot of practice and determination to carve a pumpkin without it looking horrible or having too much pumpkin on it. It is important to note that in some parts of the country it is illegal to carve pumpkins without permission. When there are no other options, some people take it as their task to carve pumpkins to the extreme in order to get away with it.

Once you make it past that initial hurdle, you'll have fun carving pumpkins and you'll begin to feel like you've accomplished something. With practice, you'll eventually be able to carve a pumpkin without it looking horrid.

Pig carving involves the application of heat and pressure to a pig that is being used to carve pumpkin.

Pumpkin Carving 101

There are a lot of different techniques and techniques used to carve a pumpkin. The basic techniques we use to carve a pumpkin are the ""basic"" or ""first"" techniques. These techniques are the core principles of carving a pumpkin. These main guidelines should be followed in order to carve a pumpkin:

Step One: Get In Shape

Before you can start carving a pumpkin, you need to get in shape. It's important to start out a little bit small so you can get accustomed to carving on your own before you have to go visit a pumpkin patch. You can look into several pumpkin carving kits or learn how to carve your own pumpkin on your own using the pumpkin carving guide found here.

Step Two: Begin Carving

Once you get in shape, it is time to practice carving. Make sure you practice carving with pumpkins you like to carve as much as possible.

Step Three: Practice Carving

You've been practicing carving a pumpkin for awhile; now is the time to go for a real test run. It may be a good idea to set your pumpkin to the side to start carving. After you're finished carving, check the pumpkin for any imperfections and, if you saw any where to begin your carving process again. You may also want to cut the pumpkin in half to see how tall you need to carve it.

Step Four: Start Carving

Now that you've started carving, you're ready to get your first pumpkin carved. Try to carve it so that you're carving it tall. You want it to be at least 30 centimeters (12.5 inches) tall, ideally over 40 centimeters (16.5 inches). That's a pumpkin a few meters (meters) high. You'll also want to see how realistic your carving is.

Step Five: Check Your Carving

If you're not pleased with how your pumpkin turned out, you may want to check to see why this happened. For example, you may have made changes to your pumpkin after your carving to make it more pumpkinsauce-"
"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — The Arkansas Legislature approved a bill Wednesday that would let school officials deny students entry on religious grounds, the second such measure in recent weeks and the latest example of a heated debate in the conservative state over LGBTQ rights.

The House voted 97-20 to pass HB 1412, and the Senate voted 31-7 in favor. Both chambers will take it up again next week.

HB 1412 says school districts may require children to get ""valid proof of attendance to the school of their parent or guardian."" That includes a certification from their child's religious school principal or a physician.

The school district could not, however, ask for any proof of religious belief.

Republican Sen. Eric Johnson of Batesville says the bill clarifies the definition of what constitutes an official declaration of a student's religious belief. He says his bill would not allow a child to not show up to an elective class for religious reasons.

Democrats denounced the measure, saying it would permit such discrimination in violation of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on a gay marriage case.

""This bill would open the door for anti-LGBTQ extremists to discriminate against LGBTQ youth, including making them use restrooms, locker rooms, shower facilities, and sports teams that don't match their gender identity,"" said Democratic Rep. Jessica Farrar.

The federal courts have ruled that states cannot discriminate against LGBTQ people on the basis of religion.

The Little Rock-based Human Rights Campaign, which led the charge on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling affirming the right of gay people to marry, criticized the measure.

""The Trump administration and extremist legislators in other states seek to roll back progress that families, students, and educators have made in this country,"" said HRC President Chad Griffin. ""With this bill, Arkansas is at risk of being the last state in the nation to let a transgender student use the bathroom or changing facility of the gender with which they identify.""

Gov. Asa Hutchinson has not weighed in on the bill. A spokesman says he is reviewing the legislation."

"It's odd to think that John Travolta's best movie was the one he made with Dustin Hoffman. For most people, the 2013 film, The Master, is the definitive work of Travolta, the one that put him on the map. But the actor himself has never been much of a fan of that film, which is why he seems to have been quite surprised when he was asked about it for a Dutch TV show.

Speaking to Nieuwsuur on Tuesday, Travolta was asked about the movie which he's been promoting heavily for the past few weeks. ""What I think is strange is that you don't see many people today making films like that,"" he said. ""Not even me. Even though I do it, I do it almost exclusively in a one-man show, because I don't feel like I have a story to tell in a film. And I think that is a good thing. But the thing is, I'm not a storyteller. I'm not a writer. And I'm not a director. And I think that's a good thing.""

"For most of the past century, the U.S. government used a legal approach to divide wealth among its citizens. The notion was that the government should, in theory, be able to tax wealthy citizens and ensure that any excess wealth was distributed to the public. But over time, the legal justification for the system has eroded.

The Revenue Act of 1862, for example, was ostensibly intended to provide for the distribution of ""immediate"" benefits to poor Americans. But the act was quickly construed to allow for the direct taxation of income and wealth. This led to a series of Supreme Court cases that began in the early 20th century that helped make the system of taxation of wealth more complicated, and less fair.

Today, the tax code is riddled with special-interest provisions that have no obvious connection to the revenue needs of the federal government.

The Tax Foundation, a think tank that's generally favorable to tax reform, released a study recently that looked at the impact of federal income tax changes over the past 40 years. The study found that both income taxes and the estate tax have grown significantly in the past 40 years, despite the fact that the federal government has cut back or eliminated many of the prior-year deductions that were used to pay for those taxes.

The report found that the tax system has effectively become a regressive tax system. For example, the bottom 10 percent of earners in the United States pay about 22 percent of their income in federal income taxes, far more than the tax burden of the second-lowest 10 percent of earners, who pay only about 3.4 percent of their income.

The tax system has become more complex, and less fair, under the current system.

The tax code is riddled with special-interest provisions that have no obvious connection to the revenue needs of the federal government. For example, the estate tax (which is not a tax) is available only to estates worth more than $5.49 million, and the estate tax exemption has been increased from $5.5 million to $11 million. And the IRS is allowed to offset up to half of the tax liability against government receipts.

And the complexity of the tax code has gotten worse over time. In 1986, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed, which eliminated the estate tax and opened the door to high-income earners to get a much larger portion of their income tax liability offset against government receipts. In recent years, the estate tax has become less and less of an issue, as the top income tax rate has been reduced from 40 percent to 35 percent.

So the tax system has become more complicated, and less fair, under the current system.

It's not clear how much of the tax code is truly necessary. Some argue that the tax code is too complicated because the vast majority of taxpayers don't pay any income taxes. Others say that it's too complicated because it penalizes the poor"

"I was shocked to see this from the Associated Press on Tuesday:

The United States and its allies have suffered a series of setbacks in the fight against the Islamic State group as the militants have taken territory in Iraq and Syria and threatened key U.S. allies. The setbacks include losses of major cities in Iraq and Syria to the extremists, as well as setbacks in the fight to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. U.S. military commanders have said Iraqi forces are fighting in conditions that are ""unprecedented"" for the militants and they face a ""very difficult fight,"" but U.S. officials have said that progress has been slow.

The implication is clear: U.S.-backed Iraqi forces are struggling, in part, because the forces it has trained and armed are not fighting effectively.

How could a U.S. training mission in Iraq and Syria be ""unprecedented?"" Well, see this report from The Guardian:

The brutal attacks against young Yazidi women and girls are the latest in a series of atrocities committed by Isis. One of the most notorious occurred in August 2014, when Isis fighters slaughtered more than 200 men and boys in the town of Sinjar. The massacre was an attempt to purge the Yazidis, an ancient religious and ethnic minority, of non-Muslims, and to create an ethnically pure Islamic State. It took place during a rapid advance by Isis through Iraq, which had previously been a largely autonomous Kurdish region. It is estimated that more than 10,000 Yazidis were killed.

I suppose ""unprecedented"" is a good way to describe the fact that, as far as one can tell, the U.S. military has no track record of ""preventing atrocities"" in its operations in Iraq and Syria.

Though the American military's record of ""preventing atrocities"" in past conflicts is not stellar, it's certainly much better than the record of the U.S. government. Here's a sampling:

-The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funded a project in 2011 to develop a chemical agent that would be ""an attractive weapon"" against insurgents in Iraq that were suspected of using chemical weapons. The project was abandoned in 2013.

-In 2010, the Pentagon with the help of the CIA and the FBI sought to develop a program that would ""counter the threat of copycat suicide bombers"" in Iraq. The project was called ""Countering Violent Extremism through Relentless Criminal Investigative Techniques."" It was abandoned in 2012.

-In 2011, the U.S. military partnered with the Iraqi military to develop techniques to track improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, and to develop a counter-IED program that would ""identify and neutralize such devices."" The effort was called the Joint IED Defeat Organization. The program was abandoned in 2011.

San Francisco, the East Bay, and Silicon Valley are the top three cities in the country for high-paid technology workers, a new study shows.

Tech workers in San Jose, Mountain View, Berkeley and Seattle have higher salaries than their counterparts in the Bay Area and other Bay Area cities, according to the study, which looked at information released by online job site Glassdoor.

""The reason San Francisco is top-ranked for high-pay jobs is because that is how people are moving to tech in the Bay Area, with high housing costs and lack of access to other cities,"" said Dan Schawbel, director of economic development for the San Francisco Chamber.

In the Bay Area, a high percentage of engineers and other technical workers (58 percent) live in San Francisco where median housing costs are higher than the national average ($1,049 a month) and commute times average more than 17 minutes.

The number of tech employees working in San Jose is also growing fast, with the highest total of engineering positions of any Bay Area city, and growing jobs tend to pay less than the national average. In contrast to the Bay Area, the highest average salary for a tech employee was in Seattle, where salaries topped $86,000.

Employment opportunities for tech workers in San Jose are growing so fast that the city may soon meet the demand for IT services it can't keep up with, according to Paul Cappelli, chief economist of Palo Alto-based Palo Alto Research Inc. That in turn could put pressure on San Jose to build new development and denser housing for high-paying tech roles.

""People with college degrees in tech may find themselves in jobs that have a different skill set from the ones they were trained for, and it may be difficult to find the kind of work they were trained for where they can make a good lifestyle,"" said Cappelli.

""The best thing that could happen for San Jose is if it continues to grow on a faster basis, both in terms of workforce size and tech employment, so that it's not like it's caught in a pattern of falling off a cliff,"" he added.

"We get to experience more than just our emotions through our body language.

Body language is an important way to understand why people think, do, feel, or act the way they do. Research shows that our body-language can reveal the emotions we are feeling, our thoughts, how we are feeling about someone, how we feel about our bodies, our sense of physical space that influences our emotions, and even the amount of sleep we've had.

It seems that we can't read our body-language in a conversation – we only see the words or body gestures we're trying to communicate. This is because we don't have the ability to read body language in this way, but if a conversation moves in a way that can't be told by the body language alone, it might be an opportunity for research to see how people are communicating through body language.

Body Language in a Conversation

In our typical conversations, we can see the words the other person uses and how they use body language, but body language itself isn't that useful to us. Even if you know what someone else is thinking or talking about, you might still not have the context in which to understand body language. This is why learning simple body language can really help a person understand how someone is approaching a topic.

Learning basic body language from watching television or movies can be difficult. We can't put ourselves into the thoughts or conversations we see when watching television, so we have to rely on our instincts and other forms of body language like eye contact or silence (see also, Do YOU Know You Are Lying About Your Body Language?).

A lot of people think that it's okay to be ""un-body-conscious."" That is to understand that if we are not overly concerned with our body, we should be okay to be ""un-body-conscious"" in a conversation. This is not a good way to think about body-language.

What is Body Language?

Body language is a way to communicate how you want to be treated with body language that communicates the feelings on an intellectual level, but without taking your emotions into account as well. This means that you are able to express your emotions without using your body. Body language makes up our language with the muscles and movements we use. The body is what allows the muscles and nerves to move.

When it comes to body language, we can be ""un-body-conscious"" by:

Using only the words in that are physically and verbally necessary, like how we use them in a phone call or text.

Just showing little ""expressions"" or just staring, with or without words.

Not looking directly at someone.

Making body movements that are exaggerated.

Using negative body language, such as yelling and cursing in a conversation.

Using body language that shows fear or anger.

Using body language that is too formal, which"
"In this post, I try to answer the question ""Should I use a generic library or a specialized one?""

First of all, I should say that I'm not a library developer myself. I'm more of a type-system programmer, and I know a lot of library developers who are not.

I've written a few open source libraries myself. But I've never thought about this question. I've never thought about what it means for a library to be specialized. I've never thought about the kinds of problems that would need to be solved.

So, I've tried to be as objective as I can be. I've tried to make this post as clear as possible. I hope that this will help you decide if a library is a good choice for you.

Generic vs. specialized

Let's start by talking about terminology.

A generic library is a library that can be used by any type that implements the generic interface.

is a library that can be used by any type that implements the generic interface. A specialized library is a library that is specifically tailored for a specific type.

A generic library needs to implement the generic interface to be useful.

A specialized library needs to implement the specific interface to be useful.

Generic library

A generic library is a module that uses typeclasses to provide a set of type-specific functions.

The typeclasses are provided by the library, and the functions are implemented by the typeclasses.

Generic libraries are very useful.

Let's look at an example.

Suppose we have a function that takes some text and hertz (the number of seconds to count down) and returns a string.

We have a typeclass TestText that defines the type of the text, and the function TestText :: Text -> String.

When we implement the typeclass, we can write

testText :: Text -> String testText = TestText ""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog""

This will be implemented by the TestText class.

And, when we call TestText, the compiler will create the function TestText :: Text -> String by the typeclass.

This is a generic library.

Now, suppose we want to use this function on a number. We want to count down from 1 to 10 with the following logic:

If the current time is before the start of the countdown, then jump to 1.

If the current time is after the start of the countdown, then go to 2.

If the current time is after the start of the countdown but before the end of the countdown, then go to 3.

Something like this:

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.

This is a specialized library.

To read the type, we have to implement the specific typeclass TestNumber"
"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - An outbreak of measles that began in the United States this summer has infected more than 50 children in Hungary, health authorities said on Friday, though the World Health Organization confirmed only seven cases in the European Union's poorest country in a report to be presented at a European Union summit next week.

The number of measles cases in 2014 globally is estimated at about 150,000, and in Europe they range between 30 and 40, according to the WHO.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Wednesday that in June a measles outbreak spread after a worker at the Disneyland amusement park in California developed the disease.

In Hungary, the U.S. Health Department was in touch with Hungarian health authorities about the Disneyland case last month, which could have put Hungarian children at risk if the virus had spread in the European Union, Hungary's Deputy Prime Minister Zoltan Kovacs said.

""If we had seen the news here, the government would have started an inquiry,"" he was quoted as telling private TV station M1 on Thursday.

""We understand what happened, we're cooperating with the United States and the U.S. is still doing their work, but there's no danger or anything,"" the deputy prime minister added.

The outbreak of a highly contagious viral disease usually affects children, but the United States began treating healthy adults from the Philippines - the only country it identified where measles spread.

In Europe, the outbreak has so far been contained mostly to a tiny region, including southern Romania, the Balkans and Greece, that has been especially affected by economic upheavals. (GMM/AFP/File)

U.S. officials said the disease was not transmitted by the respiratory route, though some health officials believe the virus might get airborne as it moves from person to person through coughs and sneezes.

In the United States, the measles vaccine is not mandatory, meaning parents who refuse the shots are at risk they could expose children to measles. There are no known or probable side effects from the vaccination, the CDC said.

The vaccine does not confer protection against mumps or rubella."

Immigration to Canada has been on a steady decline until a year or two ago, when the number started to rise again, the report said.

The Toronto region is ""an outlier, with a steady flow of immigrants into Toronto,"" the report says.

But the data show the trend is not consistent across the country.

""The trends are not comparable by province, but they are similar for the entire country,"" the report reads.

""If you look at immigration across Canada, the decline is more pronounced in Alberta and Saskatchewan (where the number of out-migrants peaked in 2014) than anywhere else.""

The population of Montreal grew by 16,600 in the same period, ""but it has remained stable in overall immigration rates and growth rates,"" the report said.

""While Montreal is the first area in Canada to experience significant population growth, growth remained somewhat steady and stable across the rest of Canada.""

The report was compiled by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives and also looked at foreign-born population in each metropolitan area in the country.

It's not just Toronto: It finds immigrants ""have become a far greater presence in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa than their share of the population would suggest."""
"The Supreme Court's recent decision on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is a reminder of the value of marriage in our society and the protection of marriage by the federal government. I believe that the decision should not be a political one, but a moral one.

Marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman, and cannot be extended to same-sex couples. President Obama signed DOMA in 1996, and no one has a moral right to deny the freedom of marriage to millions of Americans.

This decision will not change the basic definition of marriage. It is not about making a political statement. It is about protecting marriage as the union of one man and one woman. President Obama was right when he said, ""I believe in the sanctity of marriage, and I believe that marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman.""

The decision was made in the context of the debate over gay marriage. The issue of marriage is simply not a political issue. The issue at hand is about the definition of marriage. And I believe that the court is correct in its decision.

Having lived under DOMA and having witnessed the harm it has caused to so many people, I cannot support it. The couple that sued me, for example, has grown a child together, and is now raising a child of their own. This couple has never had a problem with the marriage, but now the government has forced them to say that they cannot be married. It is an act of discrimination.

Common sense dictates that the government should not be able to force gay couples to marry. I am not the first law student who has had to learn that lesson, and there will be many more. The couples and their children who have undergone the hardships of being forced to say that they cannot be married will likely not be the last.

DOMA has also forced many service members to suffer, so I am not surprised that the court did not adopt the constitutional challenge to DOMA.

DOMA is not a fiscally responsible decision. It has cost our nation billions of dollars. It will cost us even more when it is no longer applied. I am proud of the patriotism of my fellow servicemen and women, and I applaud the court for standing firm on the Constitution.

The issue of same-sex marriage is not about politics. It is about marriage. The Supreme Court has shown the country that marriage is between a man and a woman, and that the government cannot impose a definition on that.

I am proud to live in a country where people can marry who they love and where the government does not tell gay couples who they can and cannot marry.

A portion of DOMA has been struck down, so I am hopeful that the court will take a look at other parts of the law and declare that the government cannot discriminate against gay couples.

While the court has ruled"
"By the time the 2014 NBA draft rolls around, the Boston Celtics, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, and LA Clippers will be in the hunt for the top picks. After all, they'll likely be picking among a handful of top prospects including Ben Simmons (No. 1 overall), Karl-Anthony Towns (No. 2), and Jahlil Okafor (No. 3).

Meanwhile, the rest of the league's most talented teams will be scrambling to land a top prospect, and if you ask any NBA scout, they probably wouldn't mind if a top draft prospect came to their team.

With all of that said, who are the five best NBA prospects to be drafted in the 2016 NBA draft?

Cade Fairchild

Cade Fairchild

If you were to ask a select few NBA scouts, Cade Fairchild would almost certainly be the guy they'd choose to go to the Boston Celtics with the pick that is projected to be No. 1 overall.

Fairchild, a 6-foot-9, 237-pound power forward, averaged 18.2 points and 10.2 rebounds per game last season, and while his scoring average likely represents a slight downgrade from what he's done in past seasons, his per40 minutes numbers are still terrific.

On the offensive end, Fairchild is a solid rebounder with impressive finishing ability, and he's a good athlete who is capable of running the floor and scoring in transition. He doesn't possess elite size, but he's built like a brick house.

On the defensive side, Fairchild has a versatile 6-foot-10 frame that is well-built for a big man, and he possesses good lateral movement, as he shows great quickness on the defensive end.

A lot of players who average 18 points per game but don't have much defensive upside are considered a ""bust"" prospect. If you take Fairchild and put a lottery on him, it would make sense for Boston to find out about him and what he brings to the table.

Devin Booker

Devin Booker

If NBA scouts weren't willing to take a risk on Fairchild, then they have to be willing to at least give Booker a chance and see how he grows over the next three or four years before putting him in front of the nation's eyes.

Booker can become a dominant power forward at the next level, and according to DraftExpress.com, most scouts think he should be able to be an All-Star at the NBA level.

When it comes to his athleticism, Booker does nothing to dissuade that opinion. He is a great athlete with explosive leaping ability and he does a great job in transition, showcasing the ability to use his size effectively while setting screens and moving his feet in pursuit.

With the Boston Celtics as one of the teams in the chase for the No."
"The Fall of the Roman Empire

Emperor Justinian, 40 years after the death of Augustus

The western world was very far from the eastern Roman Empire at this time. In the west the Christian Church had gained a foothold, and the Roman Empire was not as powerful as it once was. In the east, the Byzantine Empire was still in its infancy. Emperor Justinian had his eyes on the city of Constantinople, and the city held great strategic value. The western empire was not likely to aspire to the same power as the eastern empire, and Justinian was determined to assert his power over the empire by supporting the Christian cause. The Christian Church was able to gain some footing in the Roman Empire, and Constantinople was the most important city in the east.

The Fall of Constantinople

The fall of the Roman Empire was the result of several factors. The early Christians were striving to establish a caliphate and were successful enough to win the battle against the pagan population. This victory gave them the upper hand, but it also led to a sharp decline in the empire's power. Byzantine residents were more conservative and more apt to support the pagan population. The empire had been weakened by the long years of barbarian occupation, and Justinian was determined to change that.

The empire had been weakened by the long years of barbarian occupation, and Justinian was determined to change that.

Tyranny of the Rich

The second major factor was the emperor himself. Justinian was obsessed with maintaining the power of the rich. He had a very good idea of what was going on in the empire, but he did not have the resources to enforce his vision. As a result, the new order went against his understanding of the way things were. Justinian was a very astute administrator, but he believed that it was his right to rule by force, and he seemed to think that he was entitled to rule by the sword. This led him to see himself as the rightful ruler of the empire, and he was not willing to let anyone else determine his destiny.

The first step in this process of tyranny was the assassination of Emperor Theodosius, which was his way of expressing his anger at the failure of Justinian's reign to rule as he wanted. The second step was to declare war on the Byzantines, who were allied with Theodosius. This war was successful, and Justinian brought the Byzantine Empire to its knees.

Empire Rebuilt

The fall of the Roman Empire was a major catastrophe for the western world. The loss of power and influence left"
"LONDON — When this political season gets going, the candidates will begin to talk about the economy, but most people have never heard the names of people like Prince Charles, who are among the richest people in the world.

In the U.K., where there's no real limit on personal wealth, Prince Charles is worth, according to a recent estimate, $15.3 billion. He's not the richest of the rich.

An analysis of their voting records shows the members of the House of Lords have the highest incomes of any political group in Britain.

The study, done by the Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change at the University of Oxford, shows the average net worth of each of the country's 447 members of parliament is £8.27 million (about $13.8 million), compared with £7.04 million for the country's 2,003 representatives in the House of Commons.

The wealthiest lawmakers in Britain are effective lobbyists who have held key positions in government.

John Barron, of the University of Pennsylvania, says the political machine in the U.K. works like a profit-making company. ""The public doesn't really know who's running the show,"" he says.

Barron studied the wealth of the U.K. House of Lords for the Lords' Research and Analysis Unit, which runs a website called LordsQuest. He notes that the top 1 percent of the British population controls about 30 percent of the wealth of the country.

""There are a lot of vested interests,"" he says. ""Most of these people are very wealthy, but they don't have to say it, because they're not in the news.""

Their wealth is hidden in financial assets, stocks, bonds, property, and the like.

Barron says that the wealth of the members of the House of Lords has increased by 5 percent in the last decade alone.

Rachel Reeves, a lawmaker from the Labour Party, says the study shows that politicians who are not in office ""have to work a lot harder than they used to to get where they are.""

""I think the public is becoming more aware that those who are in the public eye, who are often the most well-connected in society, are actually not immune from the problems of the economy,"" she says.

"What is a pylon?

A pylon is a large metal armature that goes up above the roadway in a construction zone, often between the lanes of traffic, and connects the roadway to utility work and traffic control equipment. For pylons, the large pylons are usually metal armatures bolted in place on the roadway.

Why is a pylon needed?

As we mentioned before, pylons are sometimes necessary because of lane closures or construction, but other reasons include:

Improving your roadway

Strengthening your roadway

Improving traffic flow

Maintaining a safe roadway

Improving traffic flow by reducing the number of lane changes

Building safety

Building a pylon to secure the roadway is often an easy and cost-effective way to improve traffic flow. It also gives you peace of mind knowing that the roadway will be in good condition as the pylon is removed, and the pylons won't fall down when vehicles drive, trucks and equipment drive over them, fire trucks pass over them, or when there is significant traffic on the roadway.

What type of pylons exist?

There are many types of pylons, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These are listed on our pylon pages to help you decide which is the best solution for your project.

Construction pylons

Bridges and culverts

Concrete pylons

Garden pylons

Power poles

Ramps

Rails

Parks

Roadway maintenance and reconstruction

Why are pylons so expensive?

As we said earlier, the construction costs of a pylon can range anywhere from under $5,000 to over $50,000 dollars. The cost increases because more people are using the roadway and more traffic is being created all while maintaining an even surface.

Why not just use traditional road-building techniques?

Sometimes you can't use traditional methods to secure roadway due to the presence of a structure, tree, sewer line, or other obstruction. Instead, you will need to secure the roadway using a pylon. For situations that require a pylon, there are many benefits that are just as important as the construction costs. They include safety, durability, visibility, visibility and traffic flow."
"A recent study published in the journal Science has found that sea level rise could soon accelerate due to global warming and the melting of glaciers. The study highlights the fact that the rate of sea level rise has increased by nearly a foot in the last decade.

The researchers compared several satellite-based sea level changes to the rate of sea level rise over the past century. Their findings indicate that the rate of sea level rise is on track to double in the next 30 years.

""The rate of sea level rise has increased by nearly a foot in the last decade. Although this rate of sea level rise is not unprecedented, it is the fastest increase observed over the past century,"" said study co-author Dr. Matthew Watson, a research scientist in NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado.

""As global warming melts glaciers and ice sheets, the rate of sea level rise will increase,"" said study co-author Dr. Sophie Lewis, a research scientist in NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey.

""In the next 30 years, global average sea level will rise about 6 inches,"" Watson said. ""That rate of sea level rise is also not unprecedented, but it is the fastest observed over the past century.""

The study also found that the steep rise in the rate of sea level rise is not uniform around the globe. The rate is highest in the Pacific Ocean and lowest in the Atlantic Ocean.

The new data is ""a wake-up call to climate science,"" Watson said.

""We think about sea level rise as something that happens slowly over decades or centuries. But the climate system is much more dynamic. It's like a car that accelerates and decelerates over time,"" Watson said.

Sea level rise is one of the effects of global warming. It occurs when water expands as it warms. The increased weight of the water causes it to rise.

The scientists used the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite system to measure sea level change. The satellites measure changes in the gravity field over time using a technique called gravity wave analysis. This information is used to monitor changes in the mass of the Earth's ocean.

""GRACE has provided an unprecedented wealth of information on sea level changes over the last decade, and has been instrumental in helping us understand how the rate of sea level change has changed over the last century,"" said Dr. Andrew Shepherd of the University of Southampton, who was not involved with this study.

Sea level rise is a major concern for many coastal communities around the world. It is especially worrisome for those in low-lying coastal areas and those who build on or near the ocean.

The study's findings also highlight the importance of understanding ocean circulation patterns and how they interact with climate.

""Understanding how the ocean works helps us predict how sea level will change in"

"A ""small group of people close to the Kremlin"" were behind the publication of leaks about the UK's role in leaking secret documents to the US, said the leader of the UK's opposition Labour party Jeremy Corbyn.

In a fiery speech that focused on the role the American media has played in the 2016 election campaign, as well as allegations of Russian hacking, Corbyn also claimed that a ""dossier"" written by a former Tory politician, was ""funded by some very powerful people in the USA.""

""A tiny number of people, almost all close to, and often hostile to the Kremlin, worked hard to publish this kind of dirt on a major party candidate in the American political system, all so that Donald Trump would become our president,"" Corbyn told his local party in Brighton.

""Who financed this? Some very powerful people in the USA. And that kind of meddling is deeply unpleasant.""

The remarks come just weeks ahead of the Labour conference, where the opposition leader is likely to be expected to call for an investigation into Russia's interference in the US election, which President Trump has openly backed.

The US intelligence community, on the other hand, has so far concluded that the Kremlin has directed hackers to undermine Democratic candidates and undermine Democratic organizations, and that this was in large part an effort to help Trump win, as former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort resigned just days before the Republican candidate was declared the victor.

But that may turn out to be a less significant story when compared to the allegations surrounding Russia's role in obtaining and leaking hacked documents, which included damaging material about the UK's ties with Saudi Arabia while Corbyn was head of the Stop the War coalition.

One of the opposition leader's closest critics, former Labour minister Ben Bradshaw, claimed that the leaked documents had been made to look like they had come from a ""Russian hacker"" -- something which left the impression that the documents were in fact created by a ""Russian hacker"" who might have come from abroad, but which later turned out to be authored in London. But Bradshaw didn't provide proof for his charge.

In his speech on Thursday, as he urged Labour's members to back new leader Jeremy Corbyn, Corbyn also said that he would not let a free press put the party in the ""crap hole"" that the Brexit has caused it.

""Those who have led and continue to lead this party have an absolute moral duty to get behind Jeremy and all those Labour supporters who will support him,"" Corbyn said, as he said he could not be a better leader than his ""extraordinary predecessor"" Tony Blair.

""I cannot bear being associated with a party that is in this mess.""

Corbyn, who has previously argued that the role of the media is to inform politicians as much as possible, instead spoke out in support of social media platforms, like Facebook, that are under increasing pressure following the ""Brexit"" vote."
"By Jim Eno

The term 'alternative' is so dangerous a concept because it is so easily abused. One can be a 'unabashed fan' of classical music in a way that may not be accepted by the music establishment. But which of us would dare to say that we were 'alternative' in our belief that austerity was wrong, or that we believed in a post-war social democratic welfare state?

In a new book, 'Capitalism and Alternatives', published by Verso, three of the US's leading Marxist economists, Paul Krugman, Simon Johnson and Charles Kindleberger, explore the concept of 'alternatives' in a range of areas. They explain that in the US, the concept of 'alternative' is largely a marketing term used to sell things to people who might be interested in buying the products.

""In the United States, people have a tendency to find things for sale that they like, and then they try to sell them to people who are more like them,"" says Krugman. ""If the product is a lemonade stand, there will be people who like lemonade and people who don't like lemonade, and they'll say, 'I've got kind of a lemonade stand here.""

Krugman points out that the 'alternative' label can be used by the 'fringe' of an idea. ""If there's a large number of people who like something, it's very easy for a lot of people to connect with it. If you've got a section of people who don't like something, it's a lot harder to connect with them. But even if you don't have any fringe people, you can still be in the mainstream and have an alternative,"" says Krugman.

Several practical examples from history illustrate the danger of using the concept of 'alternatives'. In the 1930s, the Nazis gave up on the idea of a nationalised economy and instead focused on creating an economy that was based on private ownership. The result was the 'Weimar Republic', which collapsed in the early 1930s. The Nazis became a very popular and effective political force in Germany, but they were not able to create a nationalised economy, and the result was a huge economic crisis and the rise of the Nazis.

""In the 1930s, Hitler had all the good ideas. In the 1960s, it was all about the Vietnam war. And in the 1970s, it was all about the environment,"" says Krugman. ""It's like the old saying: 'If you build it, they will come.'""

The book also asks whether there really is an alternative to capitalism. The authors argue that capitalism has not changed much in the past century and that it is difficult to describe it as being more 'less capitalist' than any other system.

""The question is: can we imagine a more 'capitalist' society? And the answer is '"
"The U.S. Supreme Court has recently ruled that police officers in South Africa must tell an informant's lawyer whether or not they're going to arrest the confidential informant, but the ruling did not touch on the other side of the relationship between law enforcement and informants: their families.

In this scenario, a cop has reason to fear that an informant has something compromising on him. If this comes up, the officers will tell the informant.

""If his life is in danger, the officer makes a life-or-death decision based on information he received from informants,"" says Professor David W. Silverman, a criminologist at the University of Houston. ""And the informant's information must be taken seriously in the eyes of law enforcement.""

But if those in the family of a confidential informant are not sympathetic, the confidential informant could actually become a target.

That's what happened in 2008 when the son of an informant in the Cape Town Regional Police's drug unit allegedly killed four other men and the daughter-in-law of a senior officer.

The informant had allegedly been making death threats against the three men for years in which a fourth person was killed in an attack. The informant's wife and son took part in an attempted killing in October 2008 that was foiled. The daughter-in-law was arrested and later extradited to Cape Town.

Although police are legally allowed to inform on informants (and this practice was used to help bring down a notorious gang boss in South Africa), not having a good relationship with the informant's family can be a liability.

""We know from experience that when relatives refuse to cooperate, the informant's family sometimes goes after the other members of the informant's family,"" says Goldie L. Ntshanganyane, a fellow at the National Science Foundation.

When this happens, it doesn't do much good to talk to police about how to protect the informant's family and to get that information passed on to family members. According to Ntshanganyane, police tend to rely on informal relationships instead of the formal system.

The situation is compounded by other difficulties the informant's family might encounter.

""In cases like this in South Africa…the family is often not aware that these informants were informants to police in the first place,"" Ntshanganyane says.

There is another problem, too: It's difficult for an informant to be a good witness in a court.

""A witness who is an informant may be able to give a fairly credible testimony … but he cannot be used as a witness in court because they have become informants themselves,"" Ntshanganyane says. ""They don't have an interest in the truth. They want the information that is coming to them.""

In that situation, informants won't tell police anything they don't want to. ""Informants in general are not very reliable as witnesses"
"If it comes down to it you must decide between using a keyboard or mouse in Windows. The answer depends largely on which type keyboard you're going to use. And, if using the touchpad you must consider what type of keyboard that you require. However, it's not very interesting to discuss this in a technical discussion. What's more interesting is to understand why this is the case in the first place to ensure that you don't lose your way.

The reason why there are so many keyboard options is because every keyboard has its own unique characteristics and features. They are also all designed under different pressures and temperatures which means that some of them are easier to use outdoors compared to others. On the other hand, some keyboards are made with a very specialized touchpad while others contain a multi-touch capability.

I'd like to discuss these reasons in detail. But first I want to point out that you must consider other factors too. Is it necessary to use a physical keyboard? When the answer to that question is no, then by all means, use a touchpad or mouse.

The key difference between a physical keyboard and a touchpad is the keys which are actually used. The best way to tell which is used is to use the function keys. You can press any key on your keyboard and you are told which function it is. For example, you can simply press F5. That key causes F5 to appear with the command to save. On your mouse you will know that by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse wheel with your finger. When you want to change the settings of a program, for example, hold down the left mouse button. That button allows you to change settings of the program inside the operating system.

For example if you want to change the font or the color you can simply press F5 on a physical keyboard, whereas on your touchpad you must press F6. As you can see the function keys are really quite useful.

What is better and worse is that some mice include functionality that a physical keyboard does not including a touchpad. But a touchpad is not a substitute for a physical keyboard. On the contrary. I feel that touchpads should take a back seat and be used rather than a mouse. When you want to send a text message, you must use a physical keyboard, not a touchpad. That is because a touchpad has a keyboard that is not included in Windows. On the other hand, there are programs that use a touchpad as a keypad as well. For example Google uses it on many occasions to write new messages (See our article on how to use Google with a touchpad).

So in general, physical keyboards are more usable than touchpads. But the touchpads are also less useful.

Some keyboards feature multi-touch capabilities. As soon as you press the button at the bottom to start a touch-screen you will"

Now this is an opportunity to help Ukraine improve its science and technology capabilities, while also providing Ukraine with the expertise needed to help people around the world address pressing issues like climate change and disease,"" said Robert Pastor, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.

"The term 'peanut allergy' has changed over time. In the early days of the 21st century, a peanut allergy was described as an allergy to peanuts. This was then expanded to include an allergy to tree nuts, including peanuts. This terminology was rather unfortunate. The tree nuts were not of the traditional tree variety but were instead of the grass-nut variety. The grass-nut variety is a different species to the traditional tree nut variety, and thus is not a tree nut.

The term 'tree nut allergy' was originally coined by Dr. James C. Seitz in 1952. He coined the term after observing that a number of patients with peanut allergies had no reaction to other tree nuts. Thus, they did not have a tree nut allergy. This was later expanded to include those with tree nut allergy.

However, this terminology was not very informative as a result of the fact that the tree nuts are not the same species as the traditional tree nuts. We are all exposed to different types of tree nuts each year. Furthermore, people are exposed to different types of tree nuts on different occasions. Thus, when a person has an allergy to peanuts, they can also be allergic to tree nuts.

Another way to describe the allergy is as an allergy to a specific protein. The allergy is to the protein in peanut. It can also be to a specific protein in tree nut. The term 'peanut allergy' is very confusing because of the confusion over the species of the tree nut.

The peanut allergy today is more accurately described as an allergy to the protein in peanuts. That is, the peanut allergy is to the protein in the peanuts. The tree nut allergy is not to the protein in the tree nut. However, tree nuts can contain protein which is not present in peanuts.

The allergy to tree nuts should really be called an allergy to the protein in peanuts which is the major component in peanuts. This is because the allergy to the protein in peanuts is mediated through the immune system and is not due to the presence of tree nuts.

In fact, tree nuts are not even the major component in peanuts. The protein in peanuts is the major component, but it is not the only component. There is a secondary component in peanuts which is a component found in other plant foods such as beans, tomatoes, etc. This secondary component is not very large in comparison to the major component of peanuts.

The main component of peanuts is peanut protein. One of the major things that the immune system does is to produce antibodies against this protein. Thus, the immune system will usually produce antibodies against the protein in peanuts.

However, if the immune system is not following the correct path of creating antibodies against peanut protein, the immune system will not recognize the protein as peanuts. Thus, an individual will have a reaction to peanuts but not to other tree nuts.

There has been so much pumpkin spice lately. I've been making pumpkin spice lattes, pumpkin spice oat bars, pumpkin spice granola, pumpkin spice donuts, pumpkin spice ice cream – there is actually Pumpkin Spice everywhere now. I've never had a whole pot of pumpkin spice before, so I figured I'd give this recipe a try.

I had to do some double takes when I read all of the recipes for this recipe with the word ""frosting."" I tried pumpkin pie spice and coconut sugar frosting and didn't like either one. The frosting and pie spices would have to do – you would think a pumpkin brownie would be topped with frosting.

Then I read pumpkin pie spice brownies, and was intrigued. The brownies would have to do, but I wondered – what if the brownies were topped with pumpkin spice frosting? I love pumpkin spice brownies! (Well, sometimes I have to admit that they just aren't that great, but oh well).

"The Obama administration has is still considering plans for a ""defensive"" war in eastern Ukraine against Russia should Moscow violate a cease-fire deal, senior administration officials told CNN Wednesday.

Officials said Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and National Security Adviser Susan Rice are also considering a series of steps which include a possible naval fleet deployment to the Black Sea region.

That's on top of a number of steps already taken by the administration to intensify the economic sanctions against Moscow, expand the military presence and bolster political support for Ukraine.

Asked about the Pentagon's move to add two US Army brigades to Ukraine, the Pentagon said it's still working out details on the units, what headquarters they would be operating off duty from and where they'd be operating from.

The move also comes a day before Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is set to hold a hearing on the Ukraine crisis.

Pentagon officials stressed they're only considering ""kinetic options"" -- military action -- once the cease fire is fully implemented by all parties to the conflict -- primarily the pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The issue of military options in the region is a sensitive one for the administration. It came up repeatedly in the Obama administration's first term when military options were discussed in Congress but not decided upon.

""I think it is very clear the secretary and national security advisor have a very clear and strong desire to maintain flexibility with respect to the use of military force,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""We recognize there is a broad consensus on this issue around the world. If anything, the Obama administration has sought this broad support.""

""There are still a lot of details to figure out, but this is not something that we're planning right now,"" the official also said. ""There are elements of different plans that the administration is exploring and working through. We are evaluating options, which is appropriate since the situation in Ukraine has evolved.""

The White House's new, robust approach comes after what one senior Pentagon official characterized as an ""overwhelming"" show of force from the Obama administration Tuesday in response to Russia's move to annex Crimea.

""The Russians were clearly rattled by that demonstration of strength,"" the official said.

As that occurred, Defense Secretary Hagel convened a meeting of the National Security Council team to look at ""what a defensive posture for Ukraine might look like,"" and what role the Pentagon might play, a senior administration official told CNN -- and the National Security Council staff unanimously agreed that the Pentagon would look at deploying the two new Army brigades to Europe, and to ""militarily support that posture.""

But the exact logistics and mission of those units are still being worked out, including whether they'd be based in Europe or elsewhere, and what they could be called up to do.

""What we would expect to see,"
"When the federal government announced last week that it is ending its ban on some transgender students — including those who are currently enrolled at school — it gave the state more than two months to begin enforcing the law.

A group of transgender and gender-nonconforming students, though, called on school districts around Illinois to keep their transgender residents out of bathrooms they choose.

Last week, the Obama administration made good on its promise to end an Obama-era Department of Education ban on such accommodations. The Office of Civil Rights sent letters to the nation's public schools, calling them in violation of the so-called ""Dear Colleague"" directives, after receiving dozens of complaints from students who were being excluded from bathrooms that matched their gender identity.

School districts throughout the state responded quickly, and their responses are causing concern among some lawmakers who have been pressuring the administration not to rescind the guidance, including Gov. Bruce Rauner, who said in a recent interview that ""nothing has been put in place"" to stop transgender students who are already enrolled.

The Trump administration, for its part, has not issued a statement about the letter.

Still, the Illinois Tribune's analysis found many school districts in the state continue to enforce similar discriminatory policies for transgender students.

According to court filings reviewed by the Tribune, all of the school districts covered in the analysis have policies that bar students from using the bathroom that matches the gender listed on their birth certificate, even in cases that are considered a violation of local law.

Even after the Obama administration's May 6 directive, some of these districts, including Downers Grove, DeKalb and Bloomington, continue to place local laws ahead of federal directives.

DeKalb, for instance, has a so-called ""transgender"" policy that bars students who were born male and wish to use the wrong restroom from doing so, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court Monday by students who identify as both male and female. That policy is contrary to the city's nondiscrimination ordinance and the state's Family Freedom Protection Act. The state law says that a transgender individual's gender is ""determined by a person's internal and external appearance and not based on external social stereotypes or gender stereotypes.""

Other school districts that responded to the federal letter, even if they did not issue gender-identity-based accommodations for transgender students, continued to adhere to similar discriminatory policies.

In the Downers Grove school district, for instance, students can continue to use single-stall restrooms, but the district is requiring faculty at all levels to notify administrators when a student identifies as transgender, according a July 7 letter from the district's lawyer to Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman, an Obama appointee.

DeKalb's policy is similar. The district says it can treat transgender employees and students differently because their biological sex is different from their gender identity, according to a June letter from DeKalb"

"On April 2, 2007, at 10.45am, the plane left the runway at the small community of Karpath, near the southern tip of the island of Malta, carrying an elderly couple from London and the British couple's daughter, whom they were returning to England on.

The aircraft was destined for Dublin, but it diverted to Karpath as the pilot decided to land in order to refuel. At the appointed time, at around 11am, the aircraft's crew left for the airport while the passengers, including the elderly couple and their two children, entered the plane. They were detained for two years in the notorious Libyan prison known as a ""Camp 14"".

The passengers were freed in 2008 after being flown to London and brought to Rome where they were allowed to return home. They then travelled to Europe for a reunion with their family, who were still living in Tripoli.

Their adventure raises the question of what happened to the aircraft and those who boarded it that day back in 2007. After all, if they were refugees and they came from a war-torn country, why wouldn't they fly over to their country of origin?

In a nutshell, they wouldn't, and this led to one of the most vexing mysteries of Libya's civil war. Who was on that doomed plane?

There is, however, another, more important question to be answered. What happened to their two children?

When the aircraft was diverted, the pilot told the passengers that this was his last flight, as flight operations in Tripoli, the capital, had been suspended.

Why? Not because of a bomb threat, but because of the deteriorating security situation in Libya. A bomb could have killed the pilots, possibly the passengers and all the other crew as well.

In any case, after the pilots took off, the plane's engines fell silent. That's unusual, since the planes are equipped with the so-called ""black boxes"" – they collect information that can't be obtained by other means.

One night in January 2010, Libyan state television aired an interview in which Abu Bakr Baghdadi, a militant leader known as the leader of Libya's ""Islamic State"", threatened to destroy a military airport in the capital. He said he had a secret plan to attack the country's biggest airport in Misrata.

Soon afterwards, it turned out that an armed group was also threatening Misrata's airport. But their plan, which went wrong thanks to some human error, was still secret. There was no way of knowing what to do about it.

So the pilots took their plane towards Karpath instead of Misrata, where the threat was real and where the threats were imminent

But there was another reason behind the aircraft's diversion as well. In June 2010, Libya experienced an internal conflict which escalated into armed attacks on the capital. The country's central government, headed by Abdullah"
"I've been looking into how the internet can be changed, and, since I started looking into the subject, many people have been working to get governments at a local and national level to enforce internet protections.

But there are so many challenges to this.

First, there isn't as much money as you might be led to believe.

The Federal government spent $7.45 billion on its National Science Foundation and NSF broadband projects in fiscal year (FY) 2016, and only about $1.6 billion of that is actually spent in supporting high-speed broadband infrastructure.

Of the $1.6 billion, only $130 million has been spent directly supporting broadband infrastructure.

The rest was spent on, among other things, training scientists and making it easier to get federal funding for broadband research and infrastructure, as well as funding the creation of ""digital community"" grant programs for research on the social implications of big data and digital communication, for example.

There's a lot of research being done in a lot of cities which isn't directly related to broadband. And while the Federal Government does fund many broadband projects, in the absence of funding, communities can only continue to fund their own broadband investment.

So, the internet, in many places and at the local and national level, is not really being changed. We're not seeing the sort of progress we really see with other technology investments such as roads, bridges and public transportation.

One way of tackling this can really help communities understand their Internet needs, and get the money to build broadband at the right time. That's where an international coalition called ""Let's Make broadband History"" comes in.

Let's Make broadband history

This coalition is made up of internet and technology companies who believe the Internet should be a democratic platform of access, security and privacy protection for everyone.

As such, ""Let's Make broadband history"" helps connect governments and companies with each other so that they can collaborate to make the Internet a universal resource from day one that provides security, privacy and open access to online information.

This can include investing in broadband access and in the infrastructure that delivers it, such as expanding fiber and mobile broadband networks, upgrading internet-based infrastructure, and helping build community broadband projects.

Let's Make broadband history has already worked with governments and companies in over 50 countries around the world to create a framework that ensures broadband access is a human right that should be provided to every citizens in a developed country regardless of their economic circumstances.

Here's an example of what Let's Make broadband history has done in the past:

In Brazil, Let's Make broadband history invested over $500 million in expanding Internet-based broadband. With this investment, Brazil is now the second largest country in the world to offer high speed internet across the entire country.

Now let's see if they can keep this momentum going as part of this"

"If you believe that the next American president will end the wars, end the surveillance state, and rein in Wall Street—and have the guts to run for president—here's what you need to know.

You'd better, if this is where you are, get comfortable in the middle of the table. America is not quite ready for the first female president. The last major female presidential candidate, Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.), came within a hair of a win in the 2008 primary. In the general election, she defeated Donald Trump by roughly 4 percentage points in a contest that featured many strong female candidates. And in 2012, female candidates won the popular vote by 2.8 percentage points. Even if Clinton had won, she would have been the latest in a line of failed female presidential candidates to be elected.

As such, a woman's role in politics has evolved. It's no longer a novelty that women seek to succeed in and aspire to the nation's highest office. Instead, women like Hillary Clinton (or at least some of the men who supported her bid, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo) are now the norm rather than the exception. But that hasn't stopped some of us from feeling less-than-optimistic that the country will see another woman take the stage in 2016. We should.

That's why you have the chance to write in a female president to the 2016 election, whether you're a Clinton die-hard who wants to see women have a seat at the table (or the White House, anyway). We want to create a platform for other supporters of the next female leader to write in candidates who can actually win.

And we want to inspire you to get started. We know we're asking a lot of people. But we think a Hillary Clinton presidency would make the country a lot happier.

Here are some of the reasons our project will likely succeed:

A gender gap could open on the 2016 ballot.

Our data tells us that of all the people in the country, only two-thirds of female voters view Secretary Clinton favorably; just 29 percent see her unfavorably. That gap is wider by some measures (60 percent to 28 percent). By any other measure, however, Hillary Clinton is a far preferable candidate to a Republican opponent, particularly if you look at the gender gap on the 2016 ballot.

According to a recent Washington Post poll, only about one of five Americans—or 13 percent—think Hillary Clinton would make a good president. Of the nearly five in ten, or 43 percent, of Clinton voters who say ""no way"" that she would make a good president, more than half say that no candidate would be better for women (55 percent).

As such, the 2016 presidential election is likely to be a gender split: Men see Hillary Clinton as the only choice, women see"
"A new study has found that children raised by gay and lesbian parents fare better than their peers in a number of areas.

The study, published in the Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics, is the first large-scale study to compare how children in same-sex parent families fare in terms of physical and mental health, and academic achievement.

""Our study found no differences between children in same-sex parent families and children in heterosexual parent families about the children's physical and emotional health or academic achievement,"" said lead author Dr. David Brodzinsky, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Our findings confirm what has been known for some time: Children raised by same-sex parents do not differ from children without same-sex parents in terms of their health, social, or emotional well-being.""

In addition, the study found that children raised by gay and lesbian parents displayed ""no evidence of differences in their family functioning compared to their peers raised in heterosexual families.""

The study was conducted by an international team of researchers from the U.S. and Canada. The research team analyzed data from two large U.S. longitudinal studies conducted between 1996 and 2010. The first study, conducted by the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, included more than 12,000 participants ages 8 to 21 years. The second study, conducted by the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, included over 27,000 participants ages 18 to 33 years.

The researchers analyzed the data from the two studies to determine whether or not there were differences in physical and mental health, academic achievement, and family functioning between children raised by gay and lesbian parents. They also compared children raised by gay and lesbian parents to the academic achievement of children in heterosexual parent families.

""Our research demonstrates that children raised by gay and lesbian parents fare as well as their peers in terms of the children's physical and mental health, and family functioning,"" said Brodzinsky, who is also a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""Our findings are consistent with the findings of other large-scale studies, including the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health, which found no differences in the emotional development of children in same-sex parent families compared to their peers.""

The study also found that children of same-sex parents do not differ from their peers in terms of their family functioning. The researchers found that same-sex parents provided a supportive and warm home environment that positively influenced children's health and well-being.

""Our results show that children raised by same-sex couples fare as well as children in heterosexual parent families in terms of their physical health, social functioning, and family functioning,"" said Brodzinsky. ""Our findings also support the conclusion of other large-scale studies, including the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health, which found no differences in the emotional development of children in same"
"New research suggests that the brain's electrical activity can be influenced by a simple phrase. In a 2013 study published in the journal Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, Dr. Paul F. D'Esposito (Clemson University School of Medicine) showed people two images: one depicted a man who wore a red shirt with a smiley face on it, and one depicted a female who wore a blue shirt with a frowny face on it. A computer scanned the volunteers' brains before and after the study. One group of volunteers showed an unconscious tendency to find the smiling woman more attractive. ""You have to tell your brain something when you see a smiley face,"" D'Esposito said. ""For many people it's difficult to tell."" He then used the computer scan data to find out whether the participants even recognized smiling women or not, since most of them had seen the first female image before viewing the second. The men showed an unconscious preference toward attractive smiles more than even the women did, suggesting that women are unconsciously drawn to be gazed upon—and that's the problem, D' Esposito said. (The research is described in the April 2013 issue of Frontiers in Behavior Neuroscience, published by Open Science.) The women are attracted to men who're smiling, they're not attracted to smiling women. There are other reasons for this effect, the reason that women want to be with good husbands and boyfriends, for example, and they're the result of a lot of evolutionary biology research, which is very interesting and I encourage everybody to read that. But the big question—because what we're not saying is, 'Oh, women are stupid, they'll be stupid forever,' it's more like, 'There are reasons why women want to be with good husbands and boyfriends'—and the problem is, in our current cultural environment where we judge people pretty harshly in terms of looks, women are drawn to bad looking guys. And the research is increasingly showing that that's not a good situation, which is consistent with some popular opinions.

And the reason that [there are many more attractive women in the world] is not because there are more attractive women than attractive men. In fact, people get more compliments on their physical traits than on their actual performance. Their performance varies a lot, a lot. But it's the physical characteristics. Women like the face; they like how a man looks like his face. And that's what that paper did. The people in it said they have gotten a lot of comments saying [that the] study didn't show anything at all about attraction. Women were asked to rate what they feel the male face should look like, and that's true. And these are women who like to look at faces. They're not really looking to be judged on their faces—that's a very different thing. There's a really strong connection between your face and your heart and the way you feel about yourself, and that"
"The U.S. is in a battle with Russia over a crucial region of Middle East, The Washington Post reports in an article published on Monday.

The Post reported that the Obama administration and Israel are working on a plan to help the Syrian rebels fighting the rule of Syrian President Bashar Assad, in what was described as a ""major and potentially destabilizing U.S. intervention"" in the region, the paper said.

The rebel coalition is not aligned with al-Qaeda either, but there is ""deep concern among Obama administration officials that it could end up being used by Al-Qaeda,"" as Al-Qaeda, an offshoot of the Taliban, had once controlled some of the area.

But, the report said, Syrian president Assad is not the only concern in this region.

""With help from the United States and its Arab allies, the war-torn country's Kurds are gaining ground against the Islamic State,"" the Washington Post cited an unnamed official familiar with the U.S. thinking as saying.

Turkey also has a stake in the region and is worried about the influx of refugees to its western border that could be a major security threat as it has been seen as an entry point for those fleeing the war in Syria.

"For the second time in the space of a year, New Brunswick is home to a new provincial government, a result of a non-partisan convention that has elected a provincial Liberal candidate and three New Brunswick-only MPPs.

On Friday afternoon, Liberal Leader David Alward announced that he will not seek re-election in St. Stephen-Winnipeg-Rainy River, but will run again in the region as the leader of the Liberal Party.

""It is with a great deal of sadness that I am announcing that in spite of my efforts to ensure the Liberal party is elected locally, I am not successful,"" Alward said in a statement.

Alward, an MLA since 1994, will serve out the rest of his term as Premier of New Brunswick with the support of the other 15 MLAs.

For the second time in the space of a year, New Brunswick is home to a new provincial government, a result of a non-partisan convention that has elected a provincial Liberal candidate and three New Brunswick-only MPPs. (CBC)

David Alward won the Liberal leadership race but had only won 44 per cent of the vote from a field of 15 candidates. He was replaced by Dominic Marchese, who secured a number of the party's local leaders.

Three other MPPs were elected as independents.

The party's New Brunswick caucus currently numbers 18 Liberals, eight from New Brunswick and 11 from the rest of the province. The leader is Premier David Alward.

""Today we have chosen to support a team that has delivered the best results in their own right,"" Marchese said.

He is expected to officially take over as leader on Friday afternoon.

Marchese, the party's critic for government and municipal affairs, said the party's policy priorities are to balance the budget, create jobs, provide quality healthcare that people don't have choices about, to get more people into high-quality post-secondary education and improve rural and northern New Brunswick.

The leader's oath reads:

""I swear by the Crown, Canada, Her Majesty the Queen, my Minister to the Treasury and by the Constitution Act, 1867 and every other Act of Parliament that I will perform my duties as a member of the legislative assembly of New Brunswick, under its rules, with integrity and honesty and to the best of my ability do the best I can in the discharge of my duties in accordance with the policies of this party.""

The nomination period ran from June 16 to 19, and the party made the nominations list available on its website at the beginning of the week. In a press release, the party called its nomination process ""very democratic and transparent.""

"A ""highly motivated, experienced and professionally groomed"" gunman who killed two police officers and wounded seven others in a series of shootings this week in Dallas has been named as ""Devin Patrick Kelley.""

The name of the man responsible for Wednesday's attack – which killed five officers and left dozens injured – was released by police on Friday, the Dallas Police chief said.

Dallas Police Chief David Brown, accompanied by Mayor Mike Rawlings, said that Kelley was in his mid-20s. He was described as a former Air Force member who trained in the military while living in New Braunfels, Texas.

Kelley had ""some sort of run-in with the law,"" according to the chief. The gunman was wearing ballistic vests at the time of the attack.

""The information we have, from the investigation so far, is that he went on one of his shooting sprees. There were multiple shots fired. At one point in time, he took his own life,"" Brown said. ""The suspects are dead.""

The attack also took place in an area home to military installations, a suburb with a large population of police officers.

The gunman, identified as 34-year-old Air Force veteran, is said to have exchanged gunfire with officers and was killed after barricading himself in the home.

Police said he has a history of domestic violence and that his ex-wife has filed for divorce on three occasions. A local newspaper reported that the gunman had ""severely expressed his dislike of police officers"" after he lost a girlfriend in 2012.

Brown said that the first officers were called to the scene at 12.08am. A bomb squad later removed a suspicious package at the scene.

A witness told the Guardian that one of the officers had ""a big pool of blood"" on his shirt and was saying: ""[Devin] did it. He killed five officers. He's a bad dude.""

Another witness, Michael Smith, said that he, too, heard screams and saw a woman ""covered in blood"". ""People were crying, running from the gunshots and cops,"" Smith said. ""I didn't see any police officers shoot anybody, although I did see a guy go down. He was shot in the belly.""

Kelley's estranged wife, authorities said this afternoon, had obtained a protection order against him.

"Bolted together to form the world's biggest ocean, the Pacific Ocean is home to hundreds of marine species and trillions of living organisms, from plankton to coral. In 2013 scientists estimated that there were 8.2 million square kilometers of water in the ocean, so the newly discovered planet is over four times the size of the largest ocean on Earth.

While this huge expanse of water remains fairly quiet, there are still many marine species thriving on the seabed and in its waters. While many of these marine species have been observed before, new images from a NASA satellite have revealed a new species of corals, a new genus of fish, and a new and bizarre worm that looks like a giant slug.

The photos were taken in the South Pacific and highlight some of the unique biodiversity found there.

""We really see these animals for the first time, so of course, their life-history is still under investigation,"" Michael S. Denton, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who led the newly identified photo team, said in a statement. [Photos of New Ocean Creatures]

Corals and coralline algae

The newly described species live in open sea waters around Hawaii. They are most common in areas south of Hawaii, though they also occur in areas of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans as well.

One of the newly described species of corals, Lophira alboflora, grows up to 10 inches (25 centimetres) in diameter and contains tentacles. The tiny tentacle-like appendages resemble the tips of eels' gills. Credit: Michael Denton

The species found in these photographs are Lophira alboflora, which stands for the genus Lophira. The names alboflora means ""albino"" in Hawaiian, a reference to this species' strange resemblance to albino humans — a rare condition known as albinism.

""What's so interesting about Lophira is its biology and morphology,"" S. David Schramm, a geologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who has published research on the species, said in the statement. ""I wasn't sure what they showed up to look like [when I took the images], but they're very small and very colorful, very diverse, but so different from those that we know about,"" Schramm said.

The new genus of fish, described in the same study, is aptly called ""the snail-headed sea slug."" It belongs to the family Spongidae, which also includes a number of snails, including a snail-headed clam, which is known in Hawaiian folklore because of its strange appearance.

"Guns on the ground: Remembering the victims of the San Bernardino shooting

6:16 PM

The first shooting victims of the San Bernardino shooting were identified on Thursday in the aftermath of the attack that also left 14 people dead.

The victims' relatives and friends gathered at a local church for a vigil, on the same day that the first of the mass-casualty shooting victims, 14-year-old Californian Enrique Marquez, was identified.

""He was a good kid,"" said his uncle, who asked to be identified only as Ralph.

Ralph said his nephew was a high school senior and a member of the school's varsity football team. He also was a good student and had a 4.0 grade point average. Ralph said his nephew was a second-year student at Los Angeles City College and was scheduled to graduate in the spring.

Ralph said his nephew was also an aspiring rapper, and his friends called him, ""Nisha"" or, ""The N.""

Ralph said his nephew's mother was in the process of immigrating to the United States from Mexico, and had called him to let him know that she was safe.

He said his nephew's parents were both Mexican immigrants.

""He was very excited,"" Ralph said.

Ralph said Enrique had been in the United States for about a week.

""We just want to keep him in our prayers,"" Ralph said.

On Thursday afternoon, the Sheriff's Department said Marquez was among the first victims identified in the San Bernardino shooting. The shooting spree began at about 11:20 a.m. Thursday at the Inland Regional Center - a public health facility in San Bernardino, located in the city's Inland Regional Center.

""Our hearts are heavy for the families of the victims,"" Sheriff John McMahon said in a statement.

McMahon said it was initially believed that there were two shooters.

""It is my sincere hope that we will find the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice,"" McMahon said.

The shooting began at Inland Regional Center, where a holiday party was taking place for county employees. The shooting began at the Inland Regional Center, where a holiday party was taking place for county employees.

Authorities later said there was a third shooter involved.

In a statement, the San Bernardino Police Department said the names of the deceased were being withheld pending notification of next of kin.

McMahon said the shooting began when a gunman opened fire in a conference room.

""A fight ensued and one of the shooters killed his wife,"" he said.

The San Bernardino Police Department said the shooters shot more than a dozen people, many of them in the parking lot of the Inland Regional Center.

The shooting injured at least 15 others.

"""In the last 10 minutes of his life, a young boy played a musical instrument that was just starting to take off in America. He had the courage to speak about it, and not to hide,"" Obama said at a memorial ceremony for the six-year-old boy.

Obama's remarks reflected a broader sentiment: The boy who played an old acoustic guitar -- a type of music known as folk music -- before his murder has inspired a wave of music and creative expression across his home country.

""He's an example of the fact that the United States of America does not give up. It does not stop fighting for the things that we believe in,"" Obama said of the boy. ""We will never know the full breadth of his talent. But we will never stop fighting to keep it alive.""

Obama's remarks were aimed at promoting a spirit of American innovation that's been evident in the country during the past several years as the tech sector has developed rapidly.

On Thursday, Facebook announced a $2 billion investment in a new artificial intelligence startup. Google said earlier this week it will buy artificial intelligence startup DeepMind for $400 million.

"LAS VEGAS — A new study highlights the potential of genetically engineered foods, or GMOs, to make us healthier and happier. The survey of 1,000 Americans found that nearly nine out of 10 would be willing to eat GMOs if they were labeled as such.

""If you want to really understand public opinion, you have to ask them directly,"" Dr. Tom Philpott, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, told ABC News.

""We have all been silent about it, or we've been very reluctant to say there's something wrong with the way we're farming, or that we've got to get back to the way things were like before genetically modified crops were introduced. There's been a reluctance to say it's possible that the way we're feeding the world is a problem, and that we need to do something about it.""

The survey was conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, a company that specializes in conducting opinion polls. The results were released at the 21st annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland this month.

The poll was conducted in October and November 2016, just as public opinion was beginning to shift against the controversial practice of genetically modified crops and the agricultural industries that support them.

""It's clear that we are moving forward in a direction that is very positive, and that we are getting closer to the goal of a sustainable food system,"" said Dr. Philpott, who is also director of Yale's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.

""But we have to do more, and we have to do it more quickly.""

The poll found that 84 percent of those surveyed were willing to eat GMOs if they were labeled. Half of respondents said they would not.

Among those who said they would be willing to eat GMOs, 87 percent said they would be willing to eat them if they were labeled.

""It's a very, very big number,"" Philpott said. ""The fact that over 9 out of 10 people are willing to eat GMOs if they're labeled, and if they're labeled correctly, if they're labeled correctly, that's a very positive thing.""

The poll also found that 93 percent of Americans would be willing to eat higher-fat, lower-sugar foods and 75 percent would be willing to eat more fruits and vegetables.

""If you look at this in the context of the public health campaign to improve the health of the American people, that's a very, very big number,"" Philpott said.

""It's not just a few percentage points of change of the population, it's a lot of people. More than a quarter of the population says yes, we want to eat more fruits and vegetables. And there are a lot of people who are willing to pay more for them.""

The survey also found that 75 percent of respondents"
"The International Space Station's crew of seven is getting ready to return home.

NASA's chief astronaut, Michael Hopkins, said Thursday that the station's Expedition 48 crew will start the process of undocking from the ISS at 7:52 a.m. EDT (1252 GMT) on Friday. The crew will undock using the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm.

""We're going to make a controlled, one-way valve descent and we'll go to the International Space Station and that's when the actual unpressurization will take place,"" Hopkins told reporters during a press conference. ""[The crew] will be unshackled, they'll just go on to the International Space Station and we're going to transfer them all to the Soyuz vehicle that will take them to the International Space Station.""

The crew's departure from the station was previously scheduled for June 15, but the space agency delayed it after a major Russian Progress cargo ship failed to dock with the station on Friday.

The docking procedure took longer than usual due to the delay, and NASA officials said the crew is now slated to leave on Saturday.

The station's Expedition 48 crew includes Hopkins, Russian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazanskiy, NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin, NASA astronaut Jack Fischer, and NASA astronaut Scott Kelly.

The addition of Kelly, the first American to command the station, has been a major boost for the space station's crew. Astronauts have previously launched from the station using the space shuttle, but Kelly's arrival is expected to radically change the way the space station is used.

After Kelly's arrival, NASA used the shuttle's external tank to launch a small robot, called the Orbital Test Vehicle, to the space station. However, after an engine problem, the test vehicle was unable to complete its mission and was destroyed.

The space agency plans to use the station's robotic arm to capture Kelly and bring him back to Earth.

However, NASA is facing its own problems. The space agency has been struggling to find reliable cargo for the space station. The S.S. Bill Nye ""The Science Guy"" has been calling for the return of the space shuttle.

""Shuttle is not a big contributor to the crew's life support,"" Hopkins said. ""We're going to work with the industry to try to get them back in there, and we will do it this year.""

The shuttle program ended in 2011 after over four decades of service.

NASA has also been trying to find a way to launch astronauts from the U.S. to the space station. However, those plans have been put on hold due to rising costs and the possibility of the return of the shuttle.

Hopkins said he did not think that the return of the shuttle was realistic.

""I think it's probably not going to"
"Bryan Henderson took the stage last night of Comic-Con to announce that he would be recharging the dormant comic book properties as Dark Horse's newest writer on Youngblood, the title he has been developing with Scott Allie. (The publisher had also recently teased the project with an image from an ongoing Youngblood comic.) After an early screening of the pilot episode, we learned some more information about the show, including the casting of Scott Allie's son, and the return of a few characters that were absent from last year's season of Dark Matter, including Dax (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), Sato (Alex Mallari Jr.) and D'arh (Chris Obi).

The story that Allie, Henderson and co-showrunners Simon Barry and Jody Houser will tell is set in the near future, when Earth is in desperate need of military support to deal with an alien threat that has emerged on the outer planet of Yomi. The series will focus on several veterans as they go through the trials and tribulations of being stationed on Yomi, including Major Kevin Urkel (Nana Visitor), the pilot himself, who is trying to keep the peace between alien races and the locals before his military career is over. ""It's very much a human story but it's also something that we set out from the get-go to do, which is not have an alien in the center of the story,"" Allie says. ""It's not sci-fi and the aliens are a part of the story. They're a big part of the story, they're the main characters and the audience's characters, but we're really focusing on the humans that are on Yomi.""

Of the series, Allie has this to say, ""I've always been a fan of military science fiction. All of the great ones that inspire me are all military sci-fi and they all have that military ethos — whether it's The Terminator or Die Hard. All of the great military science fiction I'm inspired by are all the kinds of novels and comics that come from a military background."" When asked if Yomi is a military or a civilian setting, Allie says, ""I think it's actually a little bit of both. It's not really military in the old-fashioned sense, but it is a military outpost."" Allie continues with, ""I mean in some ways it's a civilian setting, but it's actually a military base on earth and it also happens to be home to these alien species, which is kind of interesting to me; how could that exist in today's day and age?""

When it comes to the casting, Henderson says the show will rely a bit more on a small amount of the original cast than in previous iterations of the franchise. ""Allie had a lot of say in who they were going to bring in, but we'll have a lot of familiar faces in that"
"The second week of the 2017 MLS season is in the books in America and the Columbus Crew look to continue their undefeated streak as they travel to face the New England Revolution at Gillete Stadium.

Columbus Crew SC have now won five of their last ten regular season games. The club has failed to get one point in any of the two games they've played on the road this season and it looks like they will take a loss to the New England Revolution in Rhode Island this Saturday for the club to start a two game winning streak. After coming from ten goals down in the first half of their last game, it will be a tough start for the Crew this weekend.

After coming out flat at home against the Chicago Fire, the Crew look to turn the tables, especially after going down 2-0 to the Philadelphia Union just a few minutes into their MLS season with the game tied 1-1. Columbus will need to come out firing at the beginning of the game in order to make a statement of what has been proven time and time again this year.

For the Revolution, the club look to avoid their worst home loss in nearly three years. Coming off a 4-0 beating at the hands of Houston earlier this year, the Revs will be looking for more offense in the attack that they have been unable to find. For both teams, this is a game that should be easy on goals as neither side score a goal last season and they should be hungry for the three points they haven't been able to grab to this point."

"If President Barack Obama has his way, some new U.S. laws restricting gun rights would not only stay in place. They'll actually be expanded.

In a speech on Jan. 12 during a visit to the United Nations, Obama called for an international arms trade that would include weapons banned in America. Obama's speech was a response to growing fears that Iran may possess such weapons and to other threats.

But according to the Chicago Tribune, even though the U.S. and Iran are engaged in talks to halt their nuclear program, there's no guarantee that Iran won't sell, sell, sell to another country. And the Obama administration would be fine with it.

Some of Obama's plans for the international arms trade could expand current restrictions under the Arms Trade Treaty, a treaty aimed at limiting the spread of firearms to foreign countries. Obama could also create new, more specific arms control measures. For example, he could increase sanctions on Iran's oil industry, which is currently exempted from U.S. laws, the report states.

Obama isn't alone in wanting the world to be more like America, though gun control and other gun-related issues have been on Obama's mind lately. On Jan. 13, Obama spoke before the United Nations' General Assembly in New York. During that speech, he noted that it's difficult to argue that ""gun violence is just a problem for poor neighborhoods and inner cities."" According to the New York Times, ""Mr. Obama is right that some violence is a symptom of broader problems — violence in the street pitting one community against another... The United States has a history of trying to address that more broadly without success.""

According to the Chicago Tribune, Obama has plans to expand guns-focused domestic policy, including: universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and stricter restrictions on gun possession. But despite this support among those in the president's circle, they do have some concerns about the laws. And if the UN wants to enforce the ban on Iranian weapons, which is in the process of being signed, that's a huge deal.

According to the White House, those measures are just on the table for talks that are currently underway, and negotiations do not require congressional approval."

"In a new move on Monday night, the NBA announced it was opening a special NBA Lottery reform process that will begin with the 2017 Draft Lottery and continue through February of next year. The lottery reform has been proposed by the NBA Players Association and the league office and will ""ensure fair and equitable outcomes for all teams and players."" In addition, the lottery reform process will make the top 3 teams in a draft order and the team receiving the number one pick have increased odds to receive the No. 1 draft pick.

The new system for the NBA Draft Lottery will change the way a lottery is conducted. The number of possible teams to be selected in the lottery will decrease. The current odds with the league for the number 1 pick in the draft is 1.38% (the system now is 1.33% for teams with the same record). In the lottery reform process, the odds for getting the No. 1 pick is also reduced.

In order to ensure teams do not fall too far behind the other teams to have an increased chance to win the No. 1 pick, each team in the lottery will receive more picks. The new system that will be used for 2019 also increases the odds that any team has an increased chance of winning the draft lottery. Under the new proposed changes and a similar system with the Miami Heat's proposed plan for the 2019 draft, each team is guaranteed at least 5 more picks that they can use to gain more chances to trade up for the selection.

Under current draft law, the league uses a system to determine lottery winners based on how many years apart, in the top 3 picks in a draft, the two teams were when they made the playoffs. Therefore, teams ranked lower in the draft have more chances to get lucky with the top pick as they finished higher in the NBA standings when they made the postseason, while teams ranked higher have fewer chances to gain a better lottery odds going down.

Under the new lottery reform process, however, teams with the same record will have equal odds, and teams finishing in a tie for the third spot in the playoff race will have equal chances to move up in the order. The new lottery reform system will also increase the chances that an under-the-radar team such as the Suns, with a win percentage worse than league average and the worst record, will get the No. 3 pick. The lottery reform would give teams playing in lower leagues a better chance to move up into higher draft slots and could help spur some teams to make moves that would lead to more success moving down the draft rankings.

Additionally, the increased odds for teams, in theory, should encourage teams to trade up in the draft and get a better shot at the No. 1 overall pick and thus, help keep the process more competitive. All playoff teams have a chance to move up in the draft as the lottery pool is larger. If the Phoenix Suns are able to move up and pick"
"For over two years, this country, which has a population of over 200 million, remained frozen.


Although the very high rates of unemployment, poverty, and hunger were obvious to all, the international community did nothing to help.


But when an American journalist was admitted to a hospital, he uncovered the truth.


When the American journalist walked into the hospital, he was met by a man who said, ""I'm here to take care of you"".

The man was a doctor from the U.S. military. He said that he was a doctor from the U.S. military.


The U.S. government has a long history of kidnapping civilians in order to force them to sign false papers.


But the doctor had a choice. He could sign the paper saying he was being taken to a different country, where he would be given medical treatment.


But he chose another option.


He told the doctor, ""I don't want to sign that paper. I want to continue living here in this country, with my family, with my children.""


The doctor agreed.


The American soldier walked out of the hospital and went on his way.


The government officials who were watching by the hospital door, did not pay much attention.


But the physician who had volunteered to help, was now indignant. He said, ""What are you doing? You're taking my wife and my daughter away from me! Where the hell are you taking us?""


The U.S. government officials stared at each other for a long time.


One of them responded, ""Well, you see, we are not taking you away from this country. We are taking you away from the battle field.""


The doctor said, ""The battle field? Are you crazy? The government is forcing us to sign these papers in order to fight.""


The U.S. officials looked at each other and said, ""Ah! A true American patriot! If you're so patriotic, why didn't you turn us over to the Vietnamese government?""

The doctor replied, ""If we turn ourselves over to the Vietnamese government, they will make us do things that we are not willing to do. They will make us carry heavy loads, and they will make us work long hours. They will make us do things that we do not want to do. That is why we are doing all we can to avoid this war. We will not fight for the government, even if it is under Communist control. We will only fight for our family and our children.""


The U.S. officials decided that this American was a traitor and a spy. They arrested him, and interrogated him for a very long time.


But the doctor was not a spy. He had volunteered to help the Vietnamese people, so that he could help them avoid having to fight for the government"
"François Chollet, who is running against Emmanuel Macron in the first round of the French presidential election on 23 April, has written a book that claims the mainstream media are ""naive"" in their reporting of the presidential campaign.

In his book, The Media Myth, Mr Chollet argues that the media have become too dependent on the ability of political parties to organise and attack the media. He says the media are not doing their job – they are not informing voters.

""In today's world, the media are not independent,"" he writes. ""They are not even independent of the political parties. It is impossible to have a free and free press in France. The media are not just a conduit of information. It is not enough to be a conduit of information. The media have become a part of the political process.""

The book, which has been published in English, argues that the media have become so entwined with political parties that they have become ""enervated"" and ""intimidated"" and are not in a position to report accurately on the presidential race.

Mr Chollet's book has been met with skepticism by political pundits. They believe that Mr Chollet is trying to deflect from the deep unpopularity of the Socialist François Hollande, who is running for re-election. Mr Hollande is widely regarded as having failed to deliver on his promises of change following the worst economic crisis since the 1930s.

The book's publication comes at a time when many French people are becoming disillusioned with the political establishment. ""The book is part of a strategy to regain the media's trust,"" said Philippe Legrain, a columnist for French daily Le Monde. ""It is a way of trying to legitimise his candidacy.""

The book's timing is also curious. Mr Macron, who is seen as the 'outsider' in the presidential race, has been building up his campaign in the run up to the first round of the election on 23 April.

Mr Macron has introduced a series of reforms in the areas of labour, education and the media that have been welcomed by the media. He has also promised to boost competition in the media, and is believed to be considering the creation of a ""digital media fund"" to support new media ventures.

""It's a clear attempt to recast his image as an outsider,"" said Mr Legrain. ""The book is an attempt to portray himself as a journalist who is open to ideas and different perspectives.""

Mr Chollet, however, is not a journalist. He has been a commentator on French television for decades and has been given a platform by the media by being invited to appear on programmes to discuss the media.

""The book is a way of recasting his image as an outsider""

He has also written a series of articles on the media, and has previously accused the media of being biased"

""I was thinking that I would leave them (the posts) alone, but I have seen so many people defending white supremacy from white people on the Internet,"" she told the publication.

Ahmad, who works in human resources, had posted the comments on Facebook on November 21. Within two days, she said she received a call from a Canadian police officer who claimed that a Canadian law enforcement official had reported her comments to authorities, the newspaper reported.

Ahmad reportedly told The Local that she never intended for her Facebook post to spread across the Internet or make her a target of violence.

She went on to say that she never meant for the posts to be considered anti-Semitic, however, the Daily Mail reported.

""I'm not trying to say Jewish people are the most evil, that's not what I'm saying, but I'm saying that I'm proud of myself that I stood my ground … as a Muslim, as a person of color, an immigrant and as a woman,"" Ahmad told the Daily Mail.

A similar incident may have occurred to an Austrian man last month.

According to the Local, a group called Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization and Immigration party (PEGIDA) organized a demonstration outside of a courthouse in Vienna last Saturday.

The group, which is named for a German street of the same name, has been described as ""neo-Nazi"" and has been described as a ""somalia-loving"" movement.

A spokesperson for the Austrian interior ministry said the group's event did not violate the country's constitution, according to Austrian daily Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung.

Meanwhile, Austrian police were forced to cancel Saturday's PEGIDA demo after some local residents complained of public order and noise issues as a result of the group's protest.

A spokesperson for the Austrian Interior Ministry told The Local the group had violated the country's law on assemblies and protests.

In an effort to help PEGIDA organizers promote their event, Austria posted a video on its Facebook page calling on citizens to show up and give the ""true face of the Austrian people.""

""Austria is no longer for sale,"" the post said.

Meanwhile, PEGIDA demonstrators in France had a different take on the protests.

""We're going to make you suffer for what you did,"" the group reportedly told the anti-racism demonstrators gathered at Paris' Place de la République."

"The concept of a ""social credit"" system has surfaced in the U.K. for the first time. The idea is to reward good behavior and penalize bad behavior. The Social Credit System is a new program under which a company shares its credit scores with customers. The store will give a small discount to customers who have a good credit score.

The Social Credit System is a system that rewards good behavior and punishes bad behavior. If a company shares its credit scores with its customers, it can determine how much each customer is charged for a product, how much of that product a customer is allowed to take home, and how much money is withheld as a reward for good behavior.

People who have a good credit score will be able to get a discount when they buy a product.

People who have a bad credit score will be charged more.

It's an excellent idea. The system also makes sense. People don't want to be on the hook for an overly expensive item or any larger amounts of money.

The system will work like this: If a customer has a good credit score, they will be eligible for a discount of 5% from the store. If a customer has a bad credit score, they will not be eligible for the 5% discount.

"The Democratic Party has officially launched a federal investigation into Russian hacking into the party, according to Bloomberg News.

The investigation will examine whether the party violated its own rules and regulations, as well as the law, in the 2016 election.

The Democratic National Committee is currently being overseen by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), who resigned her position when the DNC was hacked. The DNC has hired lawyers to investigate what happened and has said that it will announce its findings sometime in the next two weeks.

In a statement, Wasserman Schultz said that the investigation would cover ""the full range of issues related to our party's cybersecurity, and will include an assessment of the DNC's cybersecurity posture and the security of our network.""

This isn't the first time the DNC has been investigated for the data breach. In May, the DNC hired a cyber-security firm to examine the hack and report back on its findings.

The DNC has also hired a cyber-security firm to examine the breach and report back on its findings.

The DNC has always denied any connection between the hack and the Trump campaign, and it has previously said that the hack was potentially done by Russia as part of a Russian intelligence operation."

"""The New York Times says Donald Trump is a racist.""

That's how CNN contributor and liberal anti-Trump Democrat David Gergen told Fox News host Chris Wallace during Monday night's GOP debate. The statement was an unfortunate mischaracterization of an article in the New York Times that didn't call Trump racist.

What Trump said about Mexico isn't racist

Gergen's comments came during exchange over Trump's recent comments that both Mexico and Canada are sending ""rapists"" to the U.S. and must ""build a wall"" to keep out illegal immigrants.

""Donald Trump has made a lot of comments — a few racist comments. He's not a racist,"" Wallace responded. ""The New York Times says that he is a racist.""

That's a complete mischaracterization of a piece in the New York Times that did not say Trump is a racist.

What Trump said about the FBI was an opinion

After Gergen brought up the controversy over Trump's ""Mexicans!"" comments, Wallace shifted the topic to Trump's criticism of FBI Director James Comey.

""The New York Times says he thinks the FBI director is protecting Hillary Clinton from potential prison time,"" Wallace said.

The New York Times did not use the ""R"" word. (CNN)

Gergen responded: ""The New York Times doesn't say that. The New York Times says that he thinks that the FBI director is protecting Hillary Clinton.""

That might not be the case. Trump has accused the FBI of being biased and leaking information against him after the FBI director announced the bureau was reopening its investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Clinton's emails.

Trump's ""a racist""

""The New York Times said he is a racist,"" Wallace agreed.

""Yes, he is a racist,"" Gergen responded.

""The New York Times says that,"" Wallace repeated. ""Yes, he said that.""

The problem here at least is the phrasing of the last line of Gergen's statement. Trump never said that the New York Times ""says that he thinks the FBI director is protecting Hillary Clinton.""

The issue is that Gergen then linked to an article written by CNN contributor Chris Cillizza, which has a slightly different version of the sentence.

Chris Cillizza headlined his piece Monday, ""The Donald: A racist? The New York Times says Trump is racist.""

Cillizza said the piece makes clear that Trump ""seems to believe that the FBI Director is not simply impartial, but actively protecting Hillary Clinton.""

""Trump says that Comey is a 'political hack,' and he claims that Comey released his letter 'for political reasons' — in other words, trying to harm his preferred candidate,"" Cillizza wrote.

Trump then responded on Twitter Tuesday evening, saying that the article that he criticized as a ""race"
"The University of California, Berkeley's Berkeley Science Center and CITRIS have announced a major grant of $4 million to create the world's first large-scale ""biospheres"" to test the development of vaccines for infectious disease. The ""biospheres,"" as they are called, are to be located in the U.S., in places where human and animal pathogens that cause disease are common.

In addition to testing the delivery of Ebola virus to mice, the ""biospheres"" will also be part of a larger study where they will be tested in pigs.

The ""biospheres"" are part of the effort at Berkeley to create a bio-primate facility, which is also part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

""When it comes to viruses, the ability to control and contain these agents is very important,"" said James Goodnight, a professor of microbiology and immunology at UC Berkeley and director of the UC Berkeley Science Center. ""And it seems that we only know so much.""

The Berkeley Center for Virology & Infectious Disease is a member of the NIH's National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Center (BNIBC), which includes laboratories in Berkeley, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Virginia.

The grant comes in two parts. The $2 million from NBIBC to research the design of the ""biospheres"" is in addition to the $50 million that the NIH has already invested in the effort and that the facility will be administered in.

The second $2 million from the National Science Foundation, part of the National Institutes of Health, will pay for the construction and the operation of the ""biospheres"" and for ""research activities related to the design and operation of the biospheres,"" according to the grant. The research to develop the ""biospheres,"" including the study of the delivery of Ebola virus, will be conducted at UC Berkeley with additional support from CITRIS, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine and the University of California at San Francisco; an individual donor received $250,000 from NBIBC on Sept. 21.

""This is not the first time the University of California, Berkeley, has supported the concept of an 'Ebola Bio-Sphere,' but that work never got off the ground, and there are always hurdles in the design and operation of the biospheres until you get the facilities built or can find an individual donor willing to provide a significant sum of money to do it,"" Goodnight said.

One problem with creating an ""Ebola Bio-Sphere"" is that ""you still have to find the right viruses to infect the right species of animals to get the viruses that will do the job."" To use a ""non-pathogenic"" virus of Ebola for the ""biospheres"" would be a very bad idea, Goodnight said.

"MELBOURNE'S most important night has finally come in its final iteration as a Grand Final contender as the AFL finalists ran up the scores to thrash Essendon by 40 points in its final home game of the year.

In the first half the Demons led by 28 points at the first break, but a combination of the Bombers scoring at will and a lacklustre effort from the visitors finally brought the game under control in the third term.

The Demons kicked the crucial goal to open the third term midway through the term when Jack Watts gathered a free kick 20 metres out, stepped up, stepped back and kicked an angled shot just inside the right hand post.

In the second term the Demons kicked 10 goals to nine over the final three quarters of the game to see off Essendon at the MCG for a 5-2 lead.

Five talking points: Melbourne v Essendon

Jack Viney and Jack Riewoldt (29 possessions each with 12 clearances and seven tackles), ruckman David Myers (30 and ten tackles with one goal), Tom McDonald (17 and 13 possessions) and defender Mark Jamar had their best games for the Demons, while former Bulldog Darcy Parish (26 and five marks) and Tom Mitchell (24 and four marks) made an impressive return from injury.


The Bombers, who were under the cosh for most of the night with 10 of their players given free kicks at the 17-minute mark of the third quarter, could only kick two goals that term and were just two clear of the Demons' four-goal lead at the final change.


Full match coverage and stats


The Bombers led by a three-point margin at half-time, but were unable to get their scoreboard ticking over after that and fell to their ninth loss of the season.


The loss was all the more bitter for Essendon as it has suffered a number of close home games in recent times, including the loss to Richmond in last year's qualifying final.


Coach John Worsfold lamented his players' performance following the match, but is pleased with what he had to show following a strong pre-season.


""The boys showed the maturity of our football club and how hard we worked for each other and I was rapt that they stuck at it,"" Worsfold said.


""They're all a little bit disappointed and they won't get that opportunity again and we have one eye on next year.


""The guys worked really hard the past 10 weeks to get ourselves into this spot and this was a great win.""


It was also an uncharacteristically poor performance from Essendon, which was in total control for much of the night but conceded a number of late goals to lose the contest.


Watts booted three majors in the first half, Jobe Watson (31) scored the game's first goal in"

"The Russian parliament's upper house has passed a bill that would allow the government to ban the streaming of content deemed to be ""extremist"" or ""extremist materials"", a move that would could be used to block sites including YouTube and Twitter.

Lawmakers voted on Monday to introduce a bill that would require Russian internet providers to store all user data for up to five years.

The bill was signed by President Vladimir Putin last month.

It would allow the government to block sites it deems to be ""extremist"" or ""extremist materials"" without a court order.

It was passed with a vote of 235-30.

The legislation would also allow the blocking of websites that ""incite hatred on grounds of race, ethnicity, language, religion, or place of birth"", according to a statement.

This could include social networks, blogs and news sites, which would be able to challenge the blocks in Russian courts.

The bill was introduced by the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, this month as a means of combating extremist content, following the attacks in Paris and the shooting in California.

""This law is not about banning any particular website,"" the Senate's head, Sergei Naryshkin, told the body.

""It just says that a court will be able to block any website that is considered to be extremist.""

The law would also allow the government to block ""extremist"" websites... If, for example, a website published a piece of information that was deemed to be extremist.

""Regrettably, the draft law contains many legal ambiguities,"" he added.

President Putin signed the bill in late December, just days after it was introduced.

The popular video site YouTube was blocked in Russia in January for over a month - and was allowed to fully resume operations again in April.

But Twitter, which allows users to publish tweets with the hashtag #ArabSpring, was blocked in Russia in December and then allowed to fully resume operations in January.

In July, the country's telecommunications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, blocked the Telegram messaging app, which was founded in 2011 by Pavel Durov and is used by millions of Russians.

Mr Putin has previously warned of the dangers of the spread of extremist content online.

In November, he called YouTube ""a place for terrorist propaganda"".

""We urge all Russians to be vigilant about the spread of extremist and extremist materials on the internet,"" he said.

""This is a serious danger for the security of our nation.""

The legislation's sponsor, member of the ruling United Russia party Vladimir Zhirinovsky, told RIA Novosti that he wanted to protect ""the traditional values of our society"" from the ""extremist propaganda on the internet"".

"The U.S. Department of Justice has the power to issue a subpoena to a nonprofit that provides health information to the insurance industry. And now the Department is threatening to wield this authority over health exchanges that are run by the state-run insurance companies themselves. How can you be sure that your information is being handled securely as requested? A better question could be: how can you be sure that you have a government that is transparent, accountable, and fair to all?

As the law stands now, insurance companies, health care providers and the federal government will be getting the data on everyone. As I've written about on this blog, the companies that run the exchanges were not always clear about what to ask when someone comes to them with information about their health problems, and what to ask of them when they receive such requests. Now that the exchanges have been opened, the question of who is holding the information may become more of an issue.

The federal government has the power to issue a subpoena to a nonprofit that holds private health information. It has a strong interest in knowing how many health problems people have. It has the power to issue a subpoena to ensure that providers aren't overcharging people by refusing to accept some treatments. It has even the authority to demand and use the data in ways it deems appropriate, including providing it to competitors of those in the market for private insurance.

The health law does, however, allow the Department of Justice to issue subpoenas ""on its own initiative for any civil or criminal investigation … relating to the regulation, taxation, certification, licensure, accreditation, inspection of a business (including insurance), or to the provision of services.""

It has now been widely reported that the Department of Health and Human Services intends to use the power of a subpoena to compel the disclosure of sensitive medical information. It may not take long – given its expansive approach to using its authority, this could very well happen very soon.

Why this is a problem is that the Department of Justice could demand not only a response from the individual requesting the information, but also from the individual to whom it is being sent. As such, it could very well be that the person requesting the data will be compelled to submit to a ""trial"" that will be in effect a search for the data in the name of the Government. The result would be that people will no doubt feel compelled to cooperate.

Furthermore, the privacy of people whose records have been requested may not be protected by the Fourth Amendment. A person's information, whether in a database or an electronic file, is not, in law, ""private."" To get a warrant for a search, the government must satisfy the special needs balancing test (the ""justification"" test), which asks whether government is likely to find some type of evidence of wrongdoing if the search were conducted.

If the health exchanges' records are the targets of a subpoena, it's plausible that the"
"The second in this week's Top 100 Players' Prospect Rankings. The rankings are done on a 1-5 scale, which is 1 meaning the player has high potential but may not make an NHL impact, 5 meaning they have potential at an NHL level but are unlikely to ever make the NHL, and 15 meaning they are almost NHL ready but unlikely.

Last time we tackled the goaltending positions in our list of top 100 prospects. Here we are focusing on defensemen, where we have an abundance of quality players. This time we are tackling the top 10 and it is a tough task, given the lack of quality offensive options available to prospects this year with the NHL lockout.

Before we begin, I'd like to say how much I like the way the Top-10 prospects of our Top-100 Prospects list are rated. As many of you know, I only go into some of these rankings with a set of predefined criteria and there are a few of those criteria I use that I had decided I was not going to allow for our top 10. I decided to just go with what I think each potential ranking should be ranked at and my criteria for that is as follows

1) Size

2) NHL Potential

3) Development

4) Team

5) NHL Potential

6) Development

7) History

8) Personality

But with that said, here is my methodology for the defensive ranks.

To get the rankings, I will go through each of the defenders' last three seasons playing under the same coach (with one goalie), and evaluate every defenseman based on their offensive and defensive ability, a combination of size/speed, strength, skill, and hockey IQ. That combination was decided, after a long process of deliberating, by a poll of our readers. So if I have a defenseman with the highest average of the three, that is how he will be ranked. However, if someone was a big fan of an older player, he and I came to a consensus ranking.

So who gets the top ranking? Well, there are good players all around the NHL. There are also some excellent prospects playing on non-playoff teams. What is surprising is that a guy like Jake Gardiner and Alex Pietrangelo can be considered a top pairing defender. I wouldn't be surprised to see those two crack the Canadiens, or even the Leafs top 4.

Now here is the second part of the list… the Top-10 defensive prospects.

#10 Jake Gardiner, Toronto Maple Leafs

"As the world's youngest gold medalist, it's easy to forget just how young Joao Havelange was when he won the world championship in 1978. He was just 16 years old and still living with his grandparents.

The young Brazilian then had to push himself through school and pursue a career in football - a sport he never really got a chance to play.

The next year, Havelange would win the gold medal at the European Championships in Spain, and the following year he would win the world championship in Spain.

Havelange had made a name for himself in the 1970s, having been one of the biggest stars in the country. At just 18 years old, he had already been named one of the most coveted players in the world by FIFA.

But it was in 1978 that Havelange really began to shine.

""He was the best player in the world before the Olympics,"" says former Portugal midfielder Rui Faria. ""Before the Olympics, he was the best player in the world.""

The World Cup champion was then voted as the best player in the world by the FIFA World Cup committee.

""At that time, he was the best player in the world,"" says former Brazil and Portugal striker de Souza. ""He was the best player in the world. Because he was so good, he started to be considered by everybody. He was the best player in the world.""

The situation looks a little different today. With the national team in dire need of a new coach, the former Tottenham striker Luiz Felipe Scolari was chosen.

""I am sure he will do well,"" says former Brazilian international Paulo Bento. ""He will make the team stronger and will give the players a great mentality. I can understand the desire of the players to change.""

Former Chelsea and Inter Milan striker Luciano Moggi agrees.

""He is a young coach,"" he says. ""What is important is that he has a good team, and he knows that he has to work hard to get the best out of his players. I think that's what he needs to do.

""He is a good coach, but he is not an old coach. He has not had the time to rebuild and to work on his ideas. I hope that he will have time to do it.""

The coach has been given a deadline of six weeks to see if his team are ready for the World Cup.

""I don't think he's going to be fired,"" says Bento.

""I think Scolari will stay because he is a good coach."""

At one time, I used to work with an engineer who had such great ideas like ""hey, if you look at the front of an aircraft, then you'll see more aircraft!"". And that's kind of the way we think about game play as well. Every piece of art you see, every piece of music you hear, every pixel, every sound, everything has been put into a game, for you to enjoy as much as I do.

So we have been doing a lot of experimenting in order to try to make the game come alive. What does this mean to you? Well, the way you play our game may differ from another player. The way a game plays for me may differ from another player. The way a game plays for you will depend on your skills and the way you want to play our game.

We want to offer the best experience possible for our players and so we put a lot of fun in the games. While the developers are working very hard to create a game that people will enjoy for hours and hours, we have to make sure everything is fun. This means putting in a lot of extra work and attention to detail. We want every element of the game to be well done and just fun.

Here is a list of things that may seem obvious, but can be a great help to you.

Use this list to help you get started when it comes to what should and shouldn't make it into the game :)

When building something on a prototype level, it is always a good idea to include all the necessary components and resources for an even better experience. This can include objects as well as data. This is especially true of things that have ""no value"" other than their appearance.

Consider the number of possible interactions between all elements in a game. A good rule of thumb is to put in at least ten different interactions and put each of these into their own category.

Use as many colors as possible in your game. It helps make them stand out from each other, and it also lets you draw attention to them more easily during development. This can also help you in your design thinking process if you plan to have a large number of objects.

Take your time during the development, and use many, many iterations to make sure things work right. This helps you find the most interesting and important things within the game and make sure your game is unique and original.

Have fun!

These aren't all of the tips we have in the game, but"
"As the world was last week, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees passed a bill to authorize the spending of an additional $621 billion through fiscal year 2014 to fight the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. This is, after all, the same Congress that just spent more than it asked for for our troops.


And now the House and Senate are in negotiations about how to pay for it. We heard from Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who said that he's got ""serious doubts"" the Congress will end up providing the additional $621 billion. That is because there just wasn't enough Democratic support for the idea of giving the President his desired new budget authority.

Let's start by explaining:

How do you propose to pay for it?

You propose to pay for it by cutting spending elsewhere. You propose to reduce the amount that the Pentagon and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff get to spend on weapons, training, supplies, supplies, and so on. But, you never propose to cut their salaries.

If you're an average American voter, you may have had some doubts as to how you would pay for the bill with your own tax dollars: you may have expected some cuts in how you pay for your federal taxes to make up what you aren't spending on wars that you weren't authorized to start. And you may have even expected that there were deeper cuts in government spending that would make up most of the rest of what you were not spending. And while you may have been prepared to say that, that is just because we've spent in excess of the president's proposal. In other words, the government has never spent more in a short period of time than was authorized for it in the law Congress had been working on.

But the truth is that no matter how much you've been paying into Social Security or how much you've spent on programs that were either authorized or authorized or authorized but didn't get money this year, you should not expect to have that money to pay for the bill. When that happens you've got a problem.

In effect, you're telling government employees that you're not giving them enough to spend this year that will pay them well into the next year.

And that is exactly what happens when you cut those top military positions, such as Gen. David Petraeus or the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There is a great deal of spending in excess of the authorized budget, a large enough amount to cover most of the cost, but not enough to cover the other expenses the Pentagon is required to manage.

Now let's look at the impact on our children and grand-children.

If the U.S. spends $700 million extra this year on war activities, how much would it pay for those wars over the next 10 years?

The answer: $600 billion. It won't pay for any"
"Minesweeper is an electronic variant of the classic 1942 British game of strategic strategy in which players are challenged to score points for their cities.

Minesweeper is available on:

Apple App Store

Google Play

Amazon Appstore

The game uses a grid of small squares which are filled with mines placed strategically. The objective is for the player to clear his opponent's mines before the end of the game.

The Minesweeper app is free to download and play. Setup is simple and all you need to do is tap or swipe your finger across the screen and you should see the game on the grid.

The game is controlled by a player's phone since the game is not cross platform. This means that it is not possible for one player to start at the same location as another. However, you can move across the grid at will and the game will automatically continue when you move.

Once you have set up the game, you can play by tapping or swiping your finger across the screen, the game will display the main screen and you should be ready to play.

You can also, if you are playing on a smartphone or tablet, tap in the grid to see the grid and the mines on it, although this may be difficult to do on a big screen.

Minesweeper is a great way to learn how to play the game or to introduce it to someone new.

You can also play the game in a smaller area and the idea is that you are competing against a smart device.

One of the best ways to play is to have two devices and use the second one to play against yourself. If you have a PC or Mac then you can also play the game on the internet.

The game is also available as a game in the iOS App Store and Google Play.

The app is free to download and play. It is possible to unlock an extra game in the app that will level up your skills.

There's a lot of fun to be had in the Minesweeper game, and it's a great way to learn.

Please note: this is an adult app and should not be played by children under the age of 13."
"This is the third in a five-part series examining the state of Illinois' public high school systems on our ""Best States"" page.


Illinois has one of only 23 school districts where 75 percent of students graduate high school, according to the U.S. Department of Education.

But that kind of achievement isn't enough to compete with its neighboring states or the other high-achieving cities of the Midwest.

""The fact that Illinois graduates far fewer students in math than neighboring states doesn't make us any more academically successful,"" said state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, R-Ill.

""If our math schools had the same number of students as those in neighboring states, the math achievement gap would be closing very quickly,"" she said.

The report showed Illinois has the nation's seventh lowest graduation rate for 15-year-olds.

When it comes to college enrollment, the state's high school students ranked 20th overall for 2015-16, according to the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, which compiles enrollment data, in addition to ranking the state for various other criteria.

The report is the latest chapter in a year-long study called ""Illinois, The Biggest U.S. Mess.""

""If you look at our overall score, we're not the best,"" Cassidy said. ""The state would do better if we were able to maintain the higher performing districts that we had.""

Some of those districts were located in northwest and northwest suburbs of Chicago, in Chicago neighborhoods, like the Albany Park/Naperville borderlands, or in other rural areas, such as Lake County.

The report found that the state's top-performing, ""golden zone"" high school districts – including Highland Park and Northbrook – saw a small decrease in their graduation rates. Both districts lost more than 25 percent of their graduation rate since 2009."

"In the latest edition of the Seattle Times' ""Ask the Experts"" series, we asked for your questions about the future of our city, our region and our nation. We received more than 500 responses. Here are a few of the more interesting questions discussed.

1. How does the future of Seattle compare to other cities?

Some of the answers in our survey are surprising, like how many people in Seattle live in extreme poverty. But the results also show the diversity of Seattle and the unique challenges it faces.

2. How do you think the future of Seattle will play out?

The answers to this question were more varied, though the analysis was mostly divided between optimistic and pessimistic views. Three in 10 respondents said Seattle will remain the same, while 54 percent said it will become a more urban, more sophisticated and more diverse city.

3. What can we do to make Seattle a better city in the future?

When asked which qualities make a city a good place to live, respondents chose health and safety, affordability, diversity, and sustainability. The responses also showed that people are concerned about transportation, housing, traffic, and the environment, among other things.

4. How will we get from here to there?

How will we get from here to there?

5. What do you think is the most important issue facing Seattle today?

Voters will decide on Proposition 1 in November, which would make the sales tax increase in Seattle permanent and raise the tax on corporations to 17.5 percent.

The question was not about which issue was most important to respondents — 32 percent chose ""the economy,"" and 30 percent chose ""the future of our region.""

6. What does the future of our region look like in 2020?

What does the future of our region look like in 2020?

7. What's the best way to keep Seattle's future bright?

The questions helped us focus our attention on the future of our region, which is home to more than 2 million people. What changes might be coming down the road?

The survey was conducted online between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15.

The results were compiled by GroupMetrix, a Seattle-based company that specializes in serving the needs of small- and medium-sized business.

"ROME (Reuters) - Italy's defense minister said on Saturday that Russia has no plans to resume military cooperation with Syria after Moscow's military intervention to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Italy's Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti (C) arrives to attend a news conference after a meeting with Italian Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti and her Croatian counterpart in Rome, Italy, March 17, 2016. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo

""The Russian military presence in Syria has ended. I can confirm that,"" Italian Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti told a news conference in Rome.

Italian-led NATO forces have been bombing Islamic State in Syria since September 2014, and had said that a Russian-backed Syrian air force had bombed U.S.-backed Syrian rebel forces including the so-called ""vetted moderate"" groups.

The Russian intervention, which Moscow says is to fight terrorism, has been widely criticized by Western countries, who say Moscow is focusing on fighting a separate battle against Assad rather than fighting Islamic State.

Swedish Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said earlier this week that Sweden would also suspend military cooperation with Russia if Moscow does not pull its support for Assad.

In a joint statement on Thursday, the United States and Britain said Russia's intervention had reinforced Assad's position, which is ""increasingly untenable."""

This is another great article from John Stossel. He is probably the most honest person I have ever known.

Here is Stossel on the benefits of being gay for a straight man:

You will be more likable to women. You will be more likable to men. You'll have a harder time with women. You'll have a harder time with men. You will be more respected by women. You will be more respected by men. It will be a better day at work. You will not be embarrassed at work. You will be more effective at work than people who are not gay … It's not just that being gay gives you a reputation, it makes you more appealing to other men. If you're out as gay to the ladies, they are not interested whatsoever. … If you have a female lover and they start having sex with you, they will notice you are gay. It'll make the women you date more interested in you. It is your greatest asset as a lover. If you're straight, if you're very attractive, they'll want to get to know you better and you'll have to be very careful to keep them interested. If you're gay, it will be easier for you to have sex because you will not have to worry about them finding you attractive. With a heterosexual woman, you'll have to make up a reason as to why she should trust you. With a lesbian, they won't care one iota.

And here is Stossel on gay kids from ""The Best of Marriage"" from May 4, 2013…

[The video embedded below contains explicit language.]

Watch the video of Stossel here.

Stossel on homosexuality in Hollywood – Stossel talks to gay actor Ryan Hansen:

I know of a famous gay actress [who was] on the show Mad Men, for six episodes. She was on that show as she was dating one of the directors. It is still on the air and has won several awards. … Every single time you look at a homosexual couple in television or film, the most stereotypical thing you see is both of the men dressed as nuns. When the show's writer's room was asked to pick a theme or theme song for the characters, the theme song that they picked was, ""Gay Marriage."" ""Gay marriage,"" a single, is the theme song for that show. If I may be so bold.

Stossel on whether it is immoral to have a gay child!

Some people who are so devoted and committed to homosexuals and to sexual promiscuity that they have two children by same-sex couples, and have children with other people they've hooked up with who are homosexuals, are doing something very immoral and very wrong,"
"I found this app while browsing the Android Playstore. I found it by going to the ""Titles"" tab and pressing the big green ""play store button"" under the big orange ""Downloads"" button and ""Search apps"".

The video I watched was about an actual real life ""disease"" called ""Listeria monocytogenes"" (listeriosis) - so yes, it does have listeria in it. But the video does not describe the symptoms that can be caused by this infection (nor the symptoms that can be caused by the ""Listeria"" symptoms), so I assume it is just marketing.

If you have listeriosis or you have any other symptoms of the listeriosis infection, don't worry. You can also watch a video about the symptoms, the symptoms of listeriosis, and how to identify the symptoms of listeriosis, as well as other videos, on the CDC's website here."
"WATCH: Director of National Intelligence James Clapper says the NSA's surveillance programs have helped stop terrorist attacks. But, according to WikiLeaks, those programs have been abused.

This story was updated at 12:30 p.m. ET.

WATCH: Director of National Intelligence James Clapper says the NSA's surveillance programs have helped stop terrorist attacks. But, according to WikiLeaks, those programs have been abused.

James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, offered the nation's top intelligence officials a rare public rebuke over disclosures by the whistleblowing group WikiLeaks of classified information about U.S. spying programs.

Clapper, who spoke on CNN on Monday, issued a scathing statement and a stern warning to WikiLeaks, saying ""the proper role of the press is to hold those in power accountable.""

""Whatever their intentions, WikiLeaks is publishing stolen information,"" Clapper said. ""They are not journalists. And they are not entitled to the protections of the First Amendment.""

Clapper also said the intelligence community is confident that its surveillance activities have helped, and are continuing to help, prevent terrorist attacks and other security threats from occurring.

""We have great confidence in our capability to continue to get the job done,"" Clapper said.

But Clapper added that the U.S. government's top spies have ""been compromised by people who don't want this country to be safe.""

""I am not going to comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,"" he said.

""What I can tell you is that our intelligence and law enforcement community is doing all it can to protect this country.""

According to WikiLeaks, the latest trove of documents is part of a larger trove of 250,000 ""top secret"" documents obtained from an intelligence contractor with access to the NSA's systems.

The latest batch of documents details the National Security Agency's capacities to ""access, record, retain, analyze and disseminate virtually all electronic communications transmitted in or originating from the United States.""

One document describes the NSA's ability to monitor social media postings and other forms of electronic communication. Some of the documents, labeled ""top secret,"" are marked ""for official use only"" and do not appear to include the word ""official.""

The documents were provided to the news organization by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked them to the news organization in the first week of May.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement that the new documents have been ""widely disseminated"" and are now available to anyone with an Internet connection. ""They reveal for the first time the inner workings of a global intelligence organization, the NSA,"" he said.

WikiLeaks has been releasing a series of about 50 documents a day for about two weeks. Assange said the U.S. government is considering criminal charges against the group. He said WikiLeaks does not have a connection to Russia.

"There was a reason that I always had a good night sleep before the wedding: my wife and I both slept through the ceremony.

We had known each other since grade school. While I would still take a girl out on a date when I was in high school, she took us to our first dance together in junior high. I remember her wearing a black silk dress with a little sequined lace overlay while she danced to a modern song that was much too long for her, and it made me want to start dancing.

I didn't have any idea what to do when we were married, either. A girl, to say the least, doesn't have to have a career plan during her entire teenage years. I was about to go to college, and it was clear that I had to pursue that path. She was happy to take on the responsibilities that came with that.

Now, this wasn't anything that I ever expected to say.

I am sure that if we were a couple who weren't having sex, I would have found some way to tell her that. But we were, and that's when I learned my life's lesson.

I was so angry at the thought of having a child out of wedlock, and not feeling wanted, that I just went ahead and did it. It worked for a while, though, and she felt happy with what was happening.

I was happy for her, but I was so angry at the fact that she couldn't understand why I didn't want to put a condom on the first date. I had no idea how she would feel when I was getting all that attention from guys I'd just met, and I wasn't sure if I was ever going to get my fair share of dates.

I spent the rest of the night hiding in my room playing with my ""play pen"" and masturbating. When she asked me how I was doing the next day, I admitted that I was an absolute mess. Even though it was late, and no one else was home, I stayed up all night playing with that thing so I could watch porn or whatever.

She texted me and asked, ""Are you all right? What's wrong with you? Are you okay without me?""

I didn't know what to say. After a few minutes she started crying. I asked her what was wrong, and she said she would never forgive me for doing it.

That was the first time that I realized that she would forever hate me for cheating on her. I couldn't believe it. I told her that I loved her but I just couldn't do it.

She called me for some reason:

""What's wrong?"" she asked, ""No one is at the door to get in.""

The whole time there was a knock at the door. It was her roommate saying that I had a few hours to be there."
"The organizers of the first-ever International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia on Wednesday announced a list of partners that will join them in the ""Pride in Toronto 2016: A Celebration of Diversity and Inclusion.""

In a press release, Mayor John Tory and Councillor Janet Davis announced that the city will donate $250,000 to Pride Toronto in the name of nine organizations that they said have been at the forefront of the LGBTQ community.

""We are honoured to be able to support groups that have been at the forefront of discrimination and inclusivity and that have made a significant impact in the community,"" Tory said in a statement.

""We are proud to welcome them to our city as our partners in Pride.""

The list of partners includes the Canadian LGBT organization Egale Canada, the advocacy group Egale Canada, the Canadian network of the International Transsexual Men's Health Network, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, the Canadian branch of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, and Toronto's Burnside Institute.

""We are thrilled to see that Toronto has such an impressive list of partners,"" Ashley Pinkerton, executive director of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, said in a statement.

""We know that these organizations are all doing valuable work to make schools safer and inclusive for all students. And we are delighted that they have been chosen to be part of Pride Toronto 2016.""

Bill C-16, the government's controversial bill that would amend the Criminal Code to prohibit discrimination on grounds of gender identity or expression, has been a source of controversy for LGBTQ, as well as activists and members of the clergy, for months.

The bill has passed second reading in the Senate, and is now likely to be debated in the House of Commons.

The law would make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on their gender identity or expression, but the government claims that there is no need to amend the law because it already protects those who are transgender.

A number of organizations have said that the law would infringe on their freedoms of religion and expression, and that they will fight it."
"View Full Version : TACO

Mango A couple years ago I saw a taco cart in the corner of a taco stand. I had no idea what it was but I knew I had to try it. After trying it I was a fan of the food and wanted to know more about it, the owner came to my house and showed me the whole shop. While the food wasn't anything great, I was impressed with the clientele. I decided to have a taco lunch, I got a taco lunch and it was above average. I decided to come back and try it out again.

So, TACO is a chain of taco stands that has been around for a while now. A few years ago the chain was just on the outskirts of San Francisco. It was a very small shop with only about 4 tacos on its menu. You had to go to the big chain food places like Chipotle and get the tacos.


So, I went to TACO and I wanted to come back again. I got a taco, it was good. It was a small shop, it didn't have a lot of seating, but it was a nice place to hang out and have a meal. I did like the food. The tacos were good, the salsa was good, the coke was good. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the service. It was slow, I had to wait for a few minutes for my order, so I had to wait a bit longer than I probably should have. The tacos, especially the coke tacos (which I didn't try) were good, but the quality of the food didn't match the quality of the service.


Overall, I liked the taco stand, but it wasn't as good as I was hoping for. I think I'll try it out again though.

jazzyj I had the same taco as you, but my lunch was not as good as yours. I got it while it was still open for lunch and it was not very good. The meat is dry and flavorless. I ate the same taco every day for the last 3 months and the last one I got was terrible.

mengan So it's a chain, but it's a really good chain. The food is really good, they're cheap, and I've been to a few of them. As someone who lives in the city, I have to travel pretty far to see one.


I've seen two guys sitting at the counter with a taco in front of them. One of them is always in there eating.


I'm not sure if they just have a lot of regulars, or if they're running a bit behind, or if they're just really weird and crazy, but the people who order the tacos are usually a lot more interesting and interesting people than the people who order the regular food.

"The first full week back from the international break, the Eagles have won and lost one game and will face a tough test in the second Test of the year.

The visitors will be without their key duo of Mitchell Pearce and Chris McQueen, with the first Test due to start on August 8.

They will have their work cut out defending the line and getting the ball to their key targets early on.

However, they have some excellent options in the backline and in the midfield.

There will be a big Test in place for skipper Michael Hooper.

The hooker has been ruled out for up to five weeks with a broken jaw and has suffered some recent criticism over his ability to cover every situation at this level but that will not deter those in the squad.

There has been an injury scare with Peter Wallace not named to face the Tigers, but I'll give him a run-out.

The 24-year-old will still be available at hooker on Saturday, providing he is 100 per cent.

He'll come after the break and be expected to play a big part in the side's game plan.

Winger James Hasson can also come into the side after a knee issue kept him sidelined for the last month, and will slot straight back into the backline.

""James Hasson is available to play this weekend,"" said coach Warren Gatland.

""Hasson has been dealing with a knee issue over the last month and will be ready to go.

""If James is to return soon it will be significant for our side and we'll look forward to seeing it.

""He's been a key part of the Test side already this year and we welcome all our players back this weekend.

""There are a number of players in the squad that missed the last few games that are still available and they should be able to come into the squad.""

On the opposite side of the field the Lions have an unenviable task.

They have had to replace seven of their players in the last month, including their best two players in Owen Farrell and Jonathan Davies.

The latter is only fit enough to make a stand-alone appearance but he is being rested in order to ensure the side is fully fit on Sunday.

They will be without Tom Youngs, who has been in with a shoulder injury that has restricted him to a few games this year after he first suffered the injury in the build-up to the World Cup.

This will come as a huge blow for the side from Ireland, who were unlucky not to have won the last series against them.

This was a must-win game for the Lions after a difficult 2-4 start and they will be counting points in their first Test against a New Zealand side without their big hitters.

However, they still have plenty in"
"The number of U-1 visas awarded in FY2015 (down 4.6%) is well below the total number of U-1 visas issued in FY2000 and FY2009, when FY2009 was the peak year of the visa (11,068,634). A significant reduction was seen in FY2010 when only 1,037,947 U-1 visas were granted (down 12.5% from the 2,026,912 in FY2009).

An even smaller reduction was estimated in FY2012 (down 18.8%). It is important to remember that the U-1 cap is only set at a maximum of 3,000 visas, and that the number of new hires who qualify under the visa category does not necessarily result in the actual number of U-1 visas issued.

The U-1 visa has been used in several types of occupations, but, for the most part, visas are issued in categories like business, professional, creative, health, education and some agricultural occupations. The U-1 visa is sometimes used in professions where the U-6 visa is already sought or not used, such as agricultural workers. The U-1 visa was not made permanent until Jan. 1, 2002. The U-6 visa was instituted by the Immigration Act of 1990, which established a permanent U-6 quota. The U-6 visa has been used by those who had applied for U-1s in the past and are currently unemployed, temporarily laid off, or employed in a job that requires the foreign worker to travel abroad to provide their services. As we will explain below, the U-6 visa is still required for most visas, which leads to a backlog of temporary workers. Moreover, it is very difficult to get an approved U-6 visa for temporary workers due to the rigorous application process, and the U-6 visa was used last year almost exclusively by temporary workers.

With most new workers being employed offshore or in service jobs, the U-1 visa was never used in the first place. For instance, in FY2000 (the peak year for the visa), only 20,000 U-1 visas were issued, whereas the number issued each year went up to nearly 40,000 by FY2010 (see Figure 1.4 in EPI's Immigration Brief).

WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer said on Wednesday that the Pentagon is trying to reduce the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, but he cautioned that the strategy will be complicated by the country's political landscape.

Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that the Pentagon was balancing the need to reduce the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan with the need to ensure that the Afghan government's security forces are ready to take over security from the United States.

Dempsey said the U.S. military was studying whether to reduce the number of U.S. troops there to between 5,000 and 10,000.

""We're trying to balance the need for the U.S. to have the most capable and capable force possible and to have a stable Afghanistan, now with the political landscape in Afghanistan, which is also a very difficult political landscape,"" Dempsey told the committee. ""We're trying to balance those two.""

He said there was no fixed number of troops that would be sufficient to deal with the Taliban, al Qaeda and other extremist groups.

Dempsey said the United States was not contemplating withdrawing all of its troops from Afghanistan, even though that would mean the end of the combat mission. Instead, he said there was a need for ""a very small contingent"" of U.S. troops to train Afghan forces and to conduct counterterrorism operations.

""If you ask me, that's probably the right thing to do,"" he said.

Dempsey said he did not know when the Afghan government would be ready to assume security responsibility from U.S. forces.

""I look at it as 'What is the next stability phase?' I don't know the answer to that question. So I have no idea when that will be,"" Dempsey said.

Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said on Tuesday that he expected the Taliban to step up attacks in the coming months. He said he expected the Taliban to launch a large number of suicide attacks in the coming months in order to undermine the Afghan government's security capabilities. (Reporting by Andrew M.

"Sociopaths are characterized by a long-term pattern of antisocial behavior, often involving crime and drug use, and a lack of remorse. Psychopaths may be uncooperative with others, have difficulty with interpersonal relationships, and lack empathy. They may lie, steal and abuse others to gain their ends. Psychopaths may have a strong need to be alone, to be in power and to be in control.

The term ""psychopath"" was coined by the British psychiatrist and political reformer, Alfred Binet, in the early 20th century. It was originally used to describe the intelligence and intellectual abilities of people who scored high on intelligence tests. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, the term has come to refer to a range of personality disorders characterized by a lack of remorse or empathy for victims, as well as a lack of ability to feel remorse for their actions. While some psychopathy theorists, such as Michael Ryan, believe that psychopathy is a distinct personality disorder, others believe that it is a form of general personality disorder.

The combination of a lack of empathy and a lack of remorse is what makes psychopathy so dangerous. It is not uncommon for psychopaths to commit crimes, even homicide, where there is no physical harm to others. Psychopaths also tend to be able to manipulate others, often without the victim's awareness.

There is also a large amount of research on the mental health of psychopaths. Psychopaths are more likely to take other psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants, drugs to interrupt the process for forming new memories, and antipsychotics, as well as more frequently being arrested for crimes.

There are many different types of psychopathy, such as narcissistic, sociopathic, sadistic and violent psychopathy. There are also different overlapping traits between different types of psychopathy. For example, there are some similarities between sadistic and violent psychopathy and between narcissistic and antisocial psychopathy. Psychopaths are also able to conform to social norms, but can also be highly extreme. There are also some differences in psychopaths from other types of criminals.

How do psychopathy and personality disorders affect the criminal justice system?

Psychopathy and other personality disorders can affect the criminal justice system and may result in a lower incarceration rate. There are also some similarities between psychopathy and violence and crime rates. For example, a study of offenders with a history of violence found that violent offenders with a history of violence were more likely than non-violent offenders to be diagnosed as psychopathic.

In addition, studies have shown a link between personality disorders and delinquency. For example, one study found that psychopaths were more likely to have committed multiple crimes than other criminals. In addition, personality disorders have been associated with a higher risk of committing crimes.

Psychopathy is also associated with higher rates of prison confinement and a negative outcome when they are released. For"

"A new poll suggests voters, not least in London, are growing increasingly fed up with Mr Corbyn and his policies.

The survey, commissioned by the Centre for London and South East Regional Development and conducted by London-based pollster YouGov, asked the electorate for their opinions of the Labour leader on the issues he has been highlighting since becoming party leader last September.

It asked: Did you support or oppose Jeremy Corbyn's recent policies on immigration, the economy, immigration and anti-Semitism? Do you agree or disagree?

The results reveal that the majority of voters don't agree with him on all of these key issues.

In the case of immigration, only 17 per cent of voters thought the prime minister's immigration strategy had worked, while 47 per cent thought it had not worked.

By contrast 40 per cent felt that Labour's approach was working and 35 per cent believed it had not.

It is also the case that more voters agreed with Labour on economics than they did with Mr Corbyn's views on Europe. Almost three times as many of the party's supporters thought Mrs May's economic policy was working (42 per cent) as said it was not (11 per cent).

Mr Corbyn's views were also somewhat out of sync with the public's on whether anti-Semitism is a problem in the UK today.

The YouGov poll asked how much the government should invest in efforts to tackle this problem, as well as the country's attitude to the question on Israel. Some 31 per cent said they agreed with the government's stance, while 29 per cent thought the government should not take any action.

Of course, there have been concerns raised about this poll and others conducted for YouGov around the leader.

A former Labour leader and the current chairman of the party is being investigated by the party's executive panel over alleged anti-Semitism, and last week former deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman made some remarks about Israel on the BBC that appeared to have been carefully crafted to damage Mr Corbyn.

But the poll shows voters remain very happy with the way Mr Corbyn has got on with the job of being leader of the Labour party."
"After losing five of six, their two-year losing streak in the NHL has been officially broken. It's not just a one. It hasn't been a six or seven or ten. It's four straight losses. It's a six-game losing streak. This is not a fluke result. This is the kind of thing you'd expect to happen when an organization has a roster full of kids with one season of hockey under their belt.

What makes this streak remarkable is the level of talent on this team.

For better or worse, a player has to be at least average in order to make the Edmonton Oilers at full strength. The league is littered with teams made up largely of NHLers, the vast majority of whom are over 24 years of age. The Oilers have had four 25-year-old players on their roster in the past 25 games.

They've been bad at hockey. Worse than bad. In fact, they are one of the worst teams in the NHL. The other two worst teams were the Washington Capitals and Toronto Maple Leafs. If you're wondering what the Leafs mean by losing their first five games of a season, well, that's the same as this.

The fact that they only dropped four of six games in regulation and overtime doesn't seem to have made any difference to the Oilers; if anything, it looks like it's helped them.

As far as individual statistics go, they've been average. Jiri Sekac has five hits in three games this season. He's played only one period of regulation time in the past five games, and not much of one. He isn't a great possession player, either.

This team, though, is still going to be good. They've still got high draft picks and a number of talented young players. As the season goes on and the games get tougher, the Oilers will be better. It's just a matter of time before they start winning fewer games."
"He says he's happy to be out of the UFC, but he's already planning his next move.


Khabib Nurmagomedov, who was released by the UFC on Saturday, said he has already been contacted by UFC matchmaker Joe Silva about a possible return to the company.


Nurmagomedov, who signed with the UFC last year, was released after his win over Tony Ferguson at UFC 209 on December 30.


""I've been talking to Joe Silva for a couple of days,"" Nurmagomedov told FloCombat on Monday. ""I'm happy to be out of the UFC, but if they want me to fight, I'm ready to fight. I want to fight the best of the best.""


Nurmagomedov, who turns 29 on December 26, lost his UFC lightweight title to Rafael Dos Anjos at UFC 205 in New York City on December 30. He avenged the loss by submitting Dos Anjos at UFC 206 in Toronto on March 11.


Nurmagomedov's release was a result of his recent history of marijuana use, according to the Nevada State Athletic Commission. A recent drug test revealed a test result of marijuana in his system.


The UFC has yet to make a formal announcement regarding Nurmagomedov's release."
"As the debate about health care continues to rage in Washington, D.C., there's new evidence that a new kind of medical technology could revolutionize the way we use a variety of nonprescription drugs. Called a nonadjuvant immunotherapy, this procedure involves a combination of genetic code sequencing, immunotherapy drugs and stem cell therapy to correct a defect in the immune system.

NADIR, or nadir albumin oligoadjutant reagent for immunotherapeutic drug, was demonstrated in a clinical trial conducted by the University of Pennsylvania. The method involves sequencing individual genes that encode CD4+ cells, the key immune system cells that recognize and destroy viruses and bacteria. This method could also be used to repair defects in the immune system of cancer patients or children with immune deficiency syndrome, according to the University.

The company, Genentech (NYSE:GEN), will partner with Penn to further develop this method. The company's research led to the development of more than 80 drugs to fight a variety of medical disorders. These include Tysabri to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, Zaltrap for a group of rare metabolic disorders and Novartis (NYSE:NVS) Genotropin for a rare liver injury, and a recently approved anti-biofilm agent for the treatment of acne.

""Genentech is at the forefront of new technology innovation, using DNA sequencing and new DNA and protein sequencing approaches to advance immunotherapies for patients and the development of new drugs to address the unmet medical needs of patients around the world,"" said Mark Reardon, senior vice president, Research and Development, Genentech Health. ""We are excited to work with Penn, who are developing novel technology that can lead toward a new generation of treatments that can improve patients' health.""

Penn is also exploring other medical applications for nonadjuvant immunotherapy, the researchers said.

The development brings an array of possibilities to physicians, said Edward G. Klimas, M.D., Ph.D., chairman of the Department of Dermatology at Penn. In particular, patients with certain forms of cancers, leukemia or immune suppression could benefit from this new technique.

This approach is also attractive to health care entrepreneurs.

""The benefits of this approach include faster drug development and cost reduction,"" Glimas said. ""As the population ages and health care costs increase, this approach offers new opportunities for new products offering the latest on-demand and cloud-based clinical and regulatory support.""

Klimas noted that Genentech has been working on this kind of nonadjuvant immunotherapy for years. This new development will open the opportunity for physicians to use this approach more effectively, he said.

Although the technology is still in its infancy, it has already led to a number of pharmaceutical applications. In 2011, the company launched a phase III clinical trial in combination"

The Pilot

The Pilot was introduced as an American-Canadian pilot who had taken the name ""Hank"" as his middle name. His parents were separated prior to the beginning of the series, however, so Hank's father was never actually mentioned by name until Episodes 5, 17 and 20. In these episodes, Hank's father is depicted as being a very successful, affluent businessman. After the plane crashes in Africa, Hank finds out that he lost his job with his father, which leaves him with nothing. However, Hank meets The Scientist, an African-American scientist that has apparently made a discovery in an unknown part of Africa. The Scientist takes Hank under his wing and teaches him how to get back his livelihood. Hank also meets the two children of The Scientist, one a little boy named William (played by Jesse Ventura), and the other a girl named Anais (played by Mary Steenburgen) and her brother, named Peter (played by David Chiang), who were kidnapped by a group of pirates. Hank then travels back to Africa, where he finds out what exactly happened.

Hank's father finally gets paid and Hank finally has a job. However, he is forced to take an experimental drug he was under the impression was only for patients with terminal cancers. In actuality, it was used to get the pilot of the same aircraft to fly closer and closer to the African village they were in. The Pilot later decides that he no longer wants to fly planes after being exposed to the experimental drug, so he does something completely illegal, and shoots an African child, because he was just standing too close to him. The Pilot later decides that flying as the Pilot is boring, so he is hired by a young, wealthy, African businessman as a mechanic for the family's new plane. Hank goes along with the plan, however, and Hank eventually finds out that his former father-in-law was really the mastermind that kidnapped all the kidnapped children, and the scientist that gave it to Hank is a very old African man named Doctor Apep (played by Ben Kingsley). Hank eventually finds out that The Scientist has now joined the crew of the new plane and helps the pilot get back the money Hank owes him. After the pilot gets back onto the plane, the plane crashes and explodes. The group that Hank and The Scientist were traveling with is left without a car and no way to get home. The Pilot then decides to take on a job as security for a large company. After Hank learns that a certain character was killed on the flight, he goes to go look for her. After he gets to a certain area, he finds out that the character he was looking for was actually none other than Captain Hook, who had just"

The Younique Museum has a complicated history. Founded by a French couture designer named Adrienne Sheppard, who was also a native of Haiti, the museum was originally built in 1964, but its original purpose was to be a museum for the Haitian community that was already living there. The people who lived in the area had been displaced by the 1954 earthquake and were forced to move to other parts of the country.

The museum was also built in response to the 1954-55 Haitian earthquake.

The museum opened in the Haitian community in Port-au-Prince in 1964, but this was a time when the country was still recovering from the devastation of the earthquake. In fact, the museum was the first to open in Port-au-Prince when the country was still recovering from the earthquake.

Like most museums, the museum was meant to be temporary. It was only supposed to be open for three years, but it was open for more than a decade and a half.

The museum was also built in response to the 1954-55 Haitian earthquake.

The museum was built in Haiti

In the 1960s, Haiti used the money from its earthquake recovery program to set up a medical center in Port-au-Prince and the Younique Museum was built right next to it.

In the 1970s, after the Haitian government became more privatized, the museum moved out of the theater and moved into a new building in the neighborhood. The building was also designed to be a public museum.

The Haiti Project was the first to open in Port-au-Prince in the early 1980s. The project was to be a museum that taught the people of Haiti about the country's history.

The Haiti Project was the first to open in Port-au-Prince in the early 1980s. The project was to be a museum that taught the people of Haiti about the country's history.

But the Haiti project was not fully funded and was shut down by the American government in 1990.

The Younique Museum moved to its current location in 2007, but it wasn't until 2009 that the country's government decided to reopen the Haiti Project and the Younique Museum.

The Haiti Project was the first to open in Port-au-Prince in the early 1980s.

""What's changed is that in the last 10 years, more Haitian families are starting to come to the museum to educate themselves about the country, its history and the future,"" says Jeffrey Lavine, the director of the museum.

The museum is still a museum. It still offers classes, tours, and exhibits, but it's also a place where people can come to learn about Haiti.

The president has also raised doubts about whether the United States would remain in the nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers last year, and his administration has also recently signaled a desire to make major cuts to international organizations.

The deal, agreed to by Iran and the major world powers in July 2015, was championed by then-President Obama and requires the country to significantly scale down its enrichment of uranium in exchange for sanctions relief.

But Trump has said the deal will not be a good one for the U.S., and he has criticized a plan that would allow Iran to have a number of its ballistic missile technology sites monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and also to take an inventory of its nuclear program.

On Wednesday, the United States imposed sanctions on six key Iranian individuals and five entities, blocking their assets in the United States and abroad for violating U.N. sanctions related to its ballistic missile program.

On July 1, Trump held a lengthy phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen with an administration official describing the call as a ""welcome breakthrough"" but noting that ""we wish that the President-elect's phone call with President Tsai will not create rifts in the U.S.-China relationship."""
"There is no word yet whether the man who killed three people outside an Oregon mall Friday night will face any charges in the murders. The three victims were shot to death and stabbed with a knife inside the Macy's department store at the Roseburg Shopping Center, where the father of two lived. Police are not releasing a possible motive at this time.

It's a tragic day that was clearly sparked when someone walked into the mall and opened fire. The shooter did not go into the store, apparently, to kill anyone. He just fired shots into a crowd of shoppers, and left.

The store was not open on Saturday. According to Oregonlive.com, there were a couple different reports that the shooter may have shot himself before his body ended up in the store's parking lot.

Authorities found the suspect dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound as SWAT team members evacuated the mall that is located on US Highway 26 near Highway 101.

Three people were killed and many others injured in the shooting, the Roseburg Police Department said. The victims range in age from 15 to 67.

Three men and a woman were killed inside the Macy's, while three women and one man were also injured.

The gunman has been identified by police in both the US and in Roseburg, including multiple media outlets. However, that information is not yet confirmed.

In a press release Saturday afternoon, Roseburg Police Chief Larry Hedgcock gave the names of five victims killed, and a sixth victim who was listed as being in serious condition, but was expected to survive.

Police said a sixth victim was brought to the hospital by private vehicle as a precaution. The shooter died at 3 p.m. at Oregon Health & Science University hospital in Portland.

A police officer was also shot while standing guard at the security office after the attack began. The officer was able to return fire, saving a second victim.

A federal judge in Hawaii Thursday gave the Trump administration 60 days to make a decision on whether to keep allowing illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. or to enforce the president's immigration order.

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson said the federal government has until May 18 to submit a status report on whether it will participate in a lawsuit that challenged President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily barring refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said Thursday that the court's order ""upholds the integrity of our nation's immigration system and ensures that our residents were not deprived of their constitutional rights by this action.""

The order is a setback for Trump who has said he was prepared to fight the ruling and has hinted at suing again in the coming months. The judge also has set a hearing for May 24 to take up a motion to dismiss the original lawsuit.

Watson, who was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, was appointed to the bench by Obama. He was nominated to the federal bench by Obama in 2009.

""This is a very good day for Hawaii,"" said Peter Margulies, who has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of the state.

The judge's order means Hawaii will have to wait until May 18 to know if the government will continue to defend the order.

The Trump administration had argued the state lacks standing to bring the case, because the state has not suffered any harm from the executive order.

A federal judge in Maryland issued a similar order on Tuesday blocking the administration from enforcing Trump's order.

"In an interview with Breitbart on Thursday morning, President Barack Obama's spokesman, Eric Schultz, said that his boss is still mulling whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which President Obama would most likely approve if he has more information about the issue. The pipeline was a ""no-brainer"" for Obama, Schultz added, but ""he's not sure about it. There are some things he's still weighing it."" He also said that President Obama believes he could get enough information through an interview with David Gregory.

When questioned about a possible Keystone approval, Schultz said:

I would say that he is still evaluating the matter right now and will be working with people to make the right decision. What has happened in this particular situation is that there's been some confusion about specific information, about specifics. This is something that I would say he'd be more than happy to have David Gregory interview him about. If and when he makes that decision, he will do so and he'll do so in a way that's respectful of the process and the interests of those of us that are affected by these decisions as well as the American people who need a safe, reliable fuel source for sure.

Earlier in Thursday's radio segment with conservative firebrands Mark Levin and Laura Ingraham, he was asked by Ingraham whether he would approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Schultz replied:

David, it's not a given that the President would approve the Keystone pipeline because it affects the climate. It impacts the price for American consumers and for Americans who use it domestically. If it were something that we could get a sense of from Mr. Gregory, he was a supporter of the pipeline in the past, perhaps, and now he's not. And we'll get him to reevaluate that at some point. He just has to get some information that would give him confidence. But again, it's not a slam dunk in the case that he made in this recent speech and it's hard to make a recommendation when you don't have the information to make one. So that's a situation that I don't know how we can solve today, I don't know whether that's going to come down to David Gregory or whether it's going to be some other individual, who knows, but it's a problem that has to be addressed.

After Ingraham asked Obama if the administration would ever approve a pipeline project that could potentially hurt the country, such as the Keystone XL project, Schultz said:

Let's see what the facts are. This isn't a slam dunk. There are some things David Gregory can ask him about or I can ask Mr. Gregory, and that's what we'll do there. But right now, it's something that we don't know the answers to, and I don't know how it's going to unfold at this time. I would also remind you that, you know, he said that he would do his part to encourage energy"

Not to be confused with Mongolian Musician, which is about a musical instrument.

Eliot, The Wild Bunch (1942) ""No one's ever seen any athlete who could do that. You guys are just Mongolian midget monkeys.""

A Mongolian midget is a middling-sized Mongolian stick-figure who is primarily used in cartoons to represent a middling-sized Mongolian stick-figure.

Mongolian midget characters are typically an average height, and have a wide range of body types, from very short to very tall, depending on the cartoon. Some are lean, some are obese, some are thin or very tall. The faces are often small, but not always; some are big, some are small. As mentioned above, they are generally very short, but some are very tall.

They may be found on a kitchen table, at a desk, or as part of the background scenery, but are mostly found on a hand-held or handheld device.

Mongolian midget characters are usually about 25 cm (10.8 in) tall, and have a wide range of body types. Confusion about their size usually arises because of their often tiny head and tiny arms, as well as the fact that they are usually depicted as very short. Those who are tall are usually depicted with bigger heads, and their arms get the same amount of room as their head, or even a bit more.

Mongolian midget characters are not to be confused with the mongolian midget, which is a musical instrument.

As the world watched the drama unfold in Ukraine over the past week, it was apparent that one thing is clear in that conflict is the presence of Russia and its support for a military coup in the country. According to a report on Al Jazeera, this support was witnessed by NATO's top military commanders in the area last month.

According to Al Jazeera, the top U.S. commander in Europe, General Philip Breedlove said Russia is providing assistance ""to a faction that is attempting to overthrow the government; a government that is backed by the United States, by our NATO allies, and has been working overtime to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty, to be able to better project power into the region as the Russians see it.""

This is not the first time that a top U.S. general has stated this, as The Guardian reported back in 2003:

A senior Pentagon official has revealed that more than a decade ago he warned the Bush administration that the invasion of Iraq was making a nuclear catastrophe in the Middle East more likely. ""They (Gulf states) were absolutely critical about getting [Iraq] out of there, saying that if they were left in we were more than likely to see a nuclear war in the Middle East and that the United States was already engaged in Iraq in military operations which were contributing to creating an environment in Iraq in which Iran is more or less already in control. It is the environment in which Iran has been able to take its foot off the gas and gain the upper hand.""

What I find interesting is the response by Russia to this new information. While there are no new details that would confirm this particular story, I was under the impression that Moscow was not happy with the way this was handled.

The news about the U.S. commanders speaking to Al Jazeera is significant because the same sources that talked to Al Jazeera have never heard a word about this from Russia. In fact, even if there are some new details, it would take a lot to have Moscow change its position on Ukraine or to put more emphasis on the importance of the Crimean peninsula.

One thing is certain to me, however. Despite the efforts of the U.S. and its NATO allies to destabilize and overthrow the government in Ukraine, this has all so far failed. I know of no government willing to put up military forces in Ukraine to fight an internal insurrection to get rid of the government. Even if those forces don't arrive before the end of this month, if the U.S. and its NATO allies were to make this threat, it would take away all hope for peaceful resolution of the crisis.

So, even if Russia wants peace, it needs Putin to show that he will not take that peace, or at least not on such a large scale. And this is where we have a very serious issue. We are entering a period of time where the United States and"
"How does TensorFlow do Machine Learning?

In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamentals of Machine Learning. We'll look at some of the many features the algorithms can use and how these can help in improving our models with high accuracy.

Machine Learning takes a lot of time, effort and even money to implement. But machine learning is a real science and has been a focus for almost 30 years (in the form of a university class).

Tensorflow is a very useful library/framework that helps with creating efficient models in the form of TensorFlow's neural networks.

What is machine learning?

The goal of machine learning is to learn things about the world we live in. The idea is that we could apply the ideas in machine learning to solve problems of every kind, such as building cars, finding stock market trends or predicting the number of earthquakes at any given point in time.

There is a lot of controversy as to how good a machine learning is. But most experts agree that machine learning can be used to make certain important decisions. These things can include such things as

Finding the best product or service

Automating processes like customer service or research

Finding useful information

Creating high accuracy models for complex problems.

The TensorFlow framework is powerful and gives a good base of understanding. All you need to learn is about the underlying concepts and get started.

Getting Started

TensorFlow is a Python library/framework that allows you to easily create neural networks. You can learn how to use TensorFlow here:

You only need one tool to get started with TensorFlow: TensorFlow. Machine learning algorithms can get really complicated, so you need a good understanding of the underlying framework.

What do we mean by a neural network? Neural networks are essentially computer programs created by giving a computer an input and a goal to accomplish. Think of a computer playing chess, or playing the stock market where an algorithm is being run to make decisions as to whether a given stock is overvalued or undervalued. That is basically how a network is created.

An input is a small amount of data, and the goal is to solve a specific problem the input represents.

There are two types of neural networks:

Deep learning : These networks are often used on images as it is easy to train large nets using this method.

: These networks are often used on images as it is easy to train large nets using this method. Convolutional neural networks: These are networks that do not have to interpret or process input data. Instead the whole network processes data for you.

Understanding Neural Networks

An example of training a neural network is like training a chess computer from scratch. A human has a certain number of pieces, and the computer decides how many pieces to place (move). It uses those pieces in a manner similar to"
"I'll be the first to tell you, I'm a huge fan of DVRs. I use them almost daily in my DVR+ DVR+ DVR+ Home theater DVR and it has completely transformed how I watch television.

The biggest reason, however, is because the DVR is a recording device, and recording shows is so much better than watching shows you recorded with your computer.

This post is going to go over what you need to get set up with your DVR and what you can do with your DVR to make sure you don't miss a thing, and then I'll go over some tips on how you can make your DVR even better.

First, What is a DVR?

The short answer is that DVRs (or digital video recorders) are devices that record TV and record live signals to them.

They do this for you — and also record shows or movies. This is done by capturing the image of a signal and using a computer to analyze it. The process works by scanning through the signal, finding the parts that are relevant to watching live TV and then saving that information to a file.

There are a few different types of DVRs, including those that use DVRX technology, which work differently, and those that stream live recordings to your computer, or record only recordings for your home theater. The DVR category is somewhat controversial because DVRs require you to have both an antenna to receive all the live TV signals and a TV to view the recordings, so there's a bit of a learning curve if you're not familiar with what's involved.

You'll often see DVRs listed as an accessory, but these have been available for years, and you can get a set for $100 or less.

What Do I Need to Set Up my DVR?

As with almost all computer equipment these days, the DVR is incredibly simple to set up and operate.

Before you begin setting up your DVR, you should first have a copy of your cable TV package, called a cable modem (this one is free). (There is also an adapter for the coaxial cable you would normally use for cable.)

Next, a USB thumb drive and/or removable thumb drive or mini drive for recording.

Last and certainly not least, an Internet connection. You'll need to get online to connect, connect your cable box, connect your TV (usually via an Ethernet cable), and start uploading recordings to your new DVR. You'll also want to have up to date software on your PC (this post describes a basic Windows 7 DVR setup).

Your DVR's Setup

Before you can start recording a show, there, you need to connect your cable box (or other TV input device) to your computer. You can simply plug in any HDMI cable you might have,"
"The most obvious difference is the price of entry. As long as you have a few hundred pounds to toss around, you can easily spend around £2,500 on a new car. But where you can get into a new car from £14,000 to £19,500, an F-Pace is more than twice that. It's also significantly more expensive over the long term, with a second-hand one costing more than double it's new-car price.

That's because Mercedes has made a big effort in designing and building this expensive model with a single motor. To get around the emissions regulations, it has a twin-turbo four-cylinder engine instead of the usual V-6. It's a little better at pumping out power, too.

The result is that the Mercedes F-Pace is surprisingly smooth and lively to drive, too. On the road, the power is just enough. Mercedes is calling it an ""active"" hybrid, a phrase I can't quite understand, because its engine and electric motors are working on completely different goals.

Mercedes uses an electronically limited electric motor that sends power and torque to the rear wheels in conjunction with its powertrain. The engine is a V-6, but the electricity in the battery is going both ways, while the electrical power is sent to the front wheels. It's a clever solution, because Mercedes can make it work using a single electrical motor, unlike a traditional hybrid engine.

Mercedes has to give it the energy it needs to work, as the electric motor is constantly adding and losing power. But at the same time, the electric motor is doing nothing which would normally slow down or retard the vehicle. Because there's already as much energy in the battery as there's going to be during the journey, the car's powertrain can work to its full potential.

So what happens when the electric motor is working overtime? It slows the engine down. The electric motor is not only doing work which keeps the vehicle moving, but it is also being taxed by the engine and its regenerative brakes, too. Mercedes has designed a new electric motor system for the F-Pace which allows this to happen more effectively and more smoothly in the corners, too.

The result is a very agile, yet relatively compliant car, which seems to have the best balance of performance and efficiency of any car on show in Geneva.

The F-Pace is also more practical than its rivals. Although it's not quite as stylish or elegant as the new A-Class flagship, on the road, it's remarkably well-proportioned for its size. Mercedes says it's able to carry up to seven people, which is pretty impressive and makes it a real option for urban city life. It's also a real option for the F-Pace driving experience as well, because the road is incredibly grippy, and the car can go"
"There is also a number of differences. For example, the current state of technology requires that the driver maintain a ""passive"" state. It's not a complete shutdown, but rather a reduced power level in the battery pack that is controlled by the ignition control system of the car. The current law would require the drivers to activate the system and the car automatically turns itself off."
"There is something that you should know about the future of human life. You will never experience anything equal to it, because you won't ever have that feeling ever again.

It is never going to happen. At least, not for real.

In fact, there isn't going to be any such thing. Or, at least, you shouldn't expect it ever to happen.

The fact that this will be reality is precisely why humanity should start preparing now for the moment that it will happen.

Because there is a very specific and specific action that humanity will need to take if it hopes to avoid the worst. Because there is a very specific and specific path that humanity will need to take if it hopes to avoid the most devastating outcomes.

So, here it is — the complete, comprehensive guide to make sure that you're doing your best to get ready right now for the moment that humanity is going to experience immortality.

This is the complete, comprehensive guide to make sure that you're doing your best to get ready right now for the moment that humanity is going to experience immortality.

We didn't make this up, and we certainly didn't create it. In these first five reasons, we have listed dozens of experts who know a great deal and a lot about this very subject, even if I don't share all these experts' insights at this moment.

That's because there is no question that immortality is the most important topic in the history of the universe, and it involves the most crucial decisions an individual is going to make.

And right now, you have a few very important choices to make. These include some very long-term matters that you are going to have to do.

For example, what would you do if you had a chance to prevent the worst suffering to ever exist? Or to be the last human alive? Or to create the greatest technological breakthroughs that you could?

These are very hard decisions (yes, really), and you need a very solid foundation to make them.

So, in this guide we're going to introduce you to a number of the best places to start.

We're going to show you all these sources — the most influential and the best places in the world to get started.

But before we get into the details of what you can and should focus on, let's take a look at the most basic thing you need to understand about immortality, and why you need to start preparing for it now:

""I can't see a reason to get ready.""

This is something that you will see a lot of people express.

People are reluctant to prepare because they are afraid of losing something (money or the good life that they have now), not so much because they are concerned about getting nothing.

Most people are afraid that immortality will be a waste of time.

"New Delhi: In an unprecedented move to enforce its anti-dowry law, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a CBI probe into allegations by a woman that her husband's estranged wife beat and drugged her within the last five years.

The High Court, meanwhile, dismissed a plea by the woman's husband seeking stay on the order.

""If the CBI is ready and willing to conduct the probe, I am sure the court will approve the case against the father and the son and order registration of a case against the woman and her husband,"" the apex court said in its order.

The court said that the order is the result of the plea filed by the complainant's husband in the Bombay High Court challenging the apex court order of September 7.

In November, the apex court had made it mandatory for a woman to approach the police on an FIR or a criminal complaint or a complaint made by any person and obtain his written, signed or oral nod before she pursues her complaint.

The woman had sought stay on the CBI probe saying she was facing harassment in the form of constant threats to kidnap her, threaten her with abduction and threats to kill her if she filed any other complaint.

The allegations were made by the woman in court.

An FIR filed by her husband in a Nashik court was filed against her in March 2013.

She has alleged in court that her husband used to blackmail her, threaten her to keep silent and even threaten to take her husband's wife into a 'ghar wapasi' case if she continued to file any complaint against him.

The court, however, said the court order as it had been passed on the plea of the husband does not mean that the Supreme Court had taken any decision on her alleged claims."

"The American Association of Suicidology is asking an Oregon jury to decide whether a man convicted of murder in the 2011 death of his girlfriend will be freed on appeal.

The group has asked a Multnomah County judge to reject the appeal of Jason David, who was convicted in December 2012 of killing his girlfriend, Lila Thorenson.

The attorney for Thorenson's mother says Friday's filing doesn't address that issue and asks the judge to reject the request.

Thornson's sister also is asking the judge to overturn David's conviction.

Police say David attacked Thorenson on their Portland apartment building balcony after she had broken up with him and tried to move out."
"A video showing a group from a Muslim extremist group destroying crosses at a church have emerged online. The group, which is called Kony2012, describes itself as a movement ""dedicated to the education of children about the true face of evil in the world.""

The video, filmed on July 5th, 2011 in Uganda, shows the group tearing down and burning crosses that were standing next to two churches in Gulu, a city in the country's northeastern region of Uganda.

The group then makes a statement.

""We are the children… And we are not the people to be fooled. You are the ones who are deceiving yourselves. You are the ones who are deceiving yourselves. It is not only Uganda…. But it is spreading everywhere.""

The group then fires shots into the air and then runs off as the camera pans past the scenes of the carnage.

The group went on to say it's time for the ""humanity"" to rise up.

""Today we are standing for what no one has done before.. We are all Kony2012.""

In 2012, an American citizen named Jason Russell was arrested for allegedly conspiring to provide material support to the LRA. In his court testimony, Russell said the movement he was organizing was meant to raise awareness of the atrocities of the LRA.

""I would be honored to stand at the front with the Ugandan people and speak in front of the Ugandan parliament and address their people.""

A total of 10 LRA officials have been indicted under the ICC for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"We've all been there, trying to put together a YouTube video to put up on the front page of Reddit. And when you're uploading a video on a site like YouTube, there's a lot of factors to keep in mind, including when it's most appropriate.

The site's front page is often the place where you'll find the most popular videos, and when you're trying to get your video up there, it can be tough to know what's the most appropriate time to upload.

Reddit's front page is moderated by the ""reddit admins,"" who are in charge of keeping the site's front page clean and safe. They've come up with a few guidelines to help you decide when to upload your video, but the worst part is they're hard to follow.

One of the most important rules to take into account is when to upload your video. The rules change from time to time, but generally speaking, YouTube videos are given a half day to appear, followed by a 24 hour wait. Reddit videos are given a day for their first three comments and then a week for their first million views.

We've put together a few examples of why you should upload your video on the right time.

What time to upload your video?

When is the best time to upload your video? It varies by user, but here are some general guidelines:

Reddit:

Never upload your video on the front page.

Just like any other post on the site, it's best to wait for a few days before uploading your video.

If you're trying to get a lot of views, you can do whatever you want with your video.

YouTube:

Upload your video on the front page of your channel as soon as possible.

YouTube is definitely the best place to upload your video. There are a ton of support people to go to if you need help.

As soon as you've uploaded your video, it'll be automatically promoted to the front page.

The best way to get your video to the front page is to get it to a popular subreddit, like r/videos.

When is the most appropriate time to upload your video?

Again, this depends on the user. If you're trying to get a lot of views and have a viral video, posting it on Reddit when it's popular is probably the best time to upload. You have other options for getting your video to the front page, like getting it to the top of r/videos or r/webcomics.

But if you're trying to get a lot of views and don't have a viral video, posting it on YouTube when it's popular is a good idea. You have other options for getting your video to the front page, like getting it to the top of r/videos or r/webcomics.

"An investigation by an investigative journalist found that a high risk of HIV has been going unpunished. The story reported that the Government of India was taking a low-road approach to the problem of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the result was a serious failure to provide adequate care and control of this pandemic.

HIV is an STI and is carried by people who have been infected, but many are unaware of their infection. It is spread by sexual contact and is passed on the same way as HIV, in blood, saliva or vaginal secretions. It can be passed to others through body fluids, including urine. The first symptoms of HIV infection include flu-like symptoms, tiredness, fever, swollen glands, and tiredness during sexual activity. If left untreated, HIV can result in many different serious health consequences, including kidney and liver problems and, if untreated, death.

The number of people with HIV in India has increased by 700% in the last four decades and the proportion is growing fast. The number is much higher among women than men and amongst black people than the rest.

India ranks as the fourth top country in the world in HIV infection, after China, the United Kingdom and Russia, with about 30% of the population living with HIV and/or a common STI. It is an important country for researchers as its statistics on HIV/AIDS are very extensive and they have been able to create new epidemiology models."
"The New York Times is reporting that the FBI seized four terabytes of information from the Apple iCloud account of one of the San Bernardino shooters. This would have been enough to fill a 5 million-square-foot data center. According to the NYT, the FBI only had time to search the iCloud of one of the shooters.

This seems like a huge overreach. It's not clear whether the government had ""a warrant"" to search the accounts of the dead shooters. If the government tried to search the iCloud accounts of other people, they should have expected to be sued for trespass. But the government's apparent failure to obtain an order directly from Apple is another example of the government's inability to find a legal way to get information from Apple.

The Times claims that the FBI only had time to search the iCloud account of one of the shooters. But that doesn't mean it's something that the government should have been able to obtain. The NSA and FBI both have access to the private information of many millions of people every day. The government's access is limited by the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches. The court system has repeatedly dealt with this problem by striking down government requests to force companies to provide information.

It's not clear whether the government had ""a warrant"" to search the accounts of the dead shooters. If the government tried to search the iCloud accounts of other people, they should have expected to be sued for trespass. But the government's apparent failure to obtain an order directly from Apple is another example of the government's inability to find a legal way to get information from Apple.

The NYT report suggests that the four terabytes of information were encrypted with a passcode, but there's no indication that the passcode was ever entered into the iCloud. The NYT also claims that the FBI had the iPhone for two weeks before alerting Apple about the problem. But the NYT reports that the FBI had the iPhone for about a week before Apple had time to respond to the government's demands. Apple would almost certainly have decided to compromise the security of its customers, not create an approach that allows the government a quick way in and out of its systems without any warning.

It's the government's failure to get a court order that is the problem here. The Department of Justice is already under a lot of pressure to do more to obtain information from Apple. The FBI's attempts to get a court order to compel Apple to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters are just another example of this administration's refusal to do what it has the authority to do."
"An Italian court has sentenced a former leader of Pizzagate, a fake news story that purported Hillary Clinton was linked to an illicit trafficking ring, to eight months in prison.

Marco Politi was found guilty Thursday in connection with spreading information about a pizzeria in Washington, DC, which was under investigation for allegedly trafficking drugs, including fentanyl, that left its menu bills for $700.

Prosecutors contend Politi was involved in a hoax on the internet that was intended to expose crimes by Clinton, the Democratic Party and the Clinton Foundation.

The conviction has been widely criticized, with some critics arguing that Politi committed no crime and others calling for the retrial of those involved in his story.

Politi, 47, was a key figure in the 'Pizzagate' conspiracy that claimed the scandal involving top officials at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was part of a wider investigation into a child-sex-trafficking ring.

The restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, is now owned by his former business partner, James Alefantis, along with his brother Robert (pictured).

DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (pictured) resigned in the aftermath of the Pizzagate allegations in 2016

The restaurant's manager was arrested in connection with the scandal in December 2016. The restaurant's manager was arrested in connection with the scandal in December 2016.

But the pizza business was not the only thing investigating in the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, as many on social media pointed to the murder case of DNC staffer Seth Rich - who was gunned down in a botched robbery in Washington DC – as the real motivation behind the fabricated conspiracy.

Seth Rich was involved in the fake story that implicated the Clintons in trafficking illicit drugs. The fake story that implicated the Clintons in trafficking illicit drugs was promoted by Pizzagate theorists

Comet Ping Pong was featured on fake news websites such as Infowars.com, and the restaurant has since been the subject of boycotts by users after the pizzeria's connections to the fake story went viral and the restaurant received threats.

Robert and Jim Alefantis are the brothers of pizza-shop owner James Alefantis, who has had ties to pro-Clinton social media platforms.

On Wednesday, former Democratic party chair Donna Brazile claimed she received a request from the Hillary Clinton campaign from a Russian hacker to release embarrassing material on Donald Trump.

Brazile claimed the request came in March 2016 and was made before WikiLeaks began publishing stolen emails from the Clinton campaign in July 2016. She said she asked John Podesta for protection due to 'a concerted effort by Russians to mess with the election'.

"""The first step is always the hardest: admitting that we have made a mistake."" -George W. Bush

""You cannot go home again."" -Ralph Nader

At the time of the 2016 presidential election, it seems like it wasn't a crazy idea that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could end up in the White House. It didn't seem too insane to think that they could potentially be the first president and president-elect to do so.

The problem is that a great big mess has fallen upon us. The American public is deeply divided. The media was already in a frenzy with headlines like ""The End of the Post-Cold War Era"" or ""American Idol Has a New Champion: Donald Trump."" With a few notable exceptions, the American public is apathetic, disillusioned, and even fearful of changing the status quo. There is no real consensus, no direction, no guiding principles. It is a very strange state of affairs in a country that is still a nation ruled by a democratic constitution.

Despite so much bad news happening in the world, we can only make a decision as a society and as individuals. This is, of course, what makes it so difficult to come to grips with all of the problems we face. It just doesn't feel like the right time to fight. I don't even think we should bother fighting if it doesn't benefit us or those who we love. I think it is time we try and make things right.

So what is the best course of action?

One of the first things I would do is to start by taking a good hard look at myself. The problem with a lot of things is that we don't see the big picture yet. We don't understand what we are doing in the present in all of its importance and importance.

The problems we face are actually very easy to resolve: our environment is not too polluted to start with; we are not drowning in debt; we don't have too many guns; and we have a world that is safe enough for all of our children to thrive and enjoy.

So let's take a look at the problems we face and decide what we think are the problems, and what we are going to do about it.

Let's take a closer look at what Trump and Sanders are talking about when they talk about the financial sector

Trump vs Sanders

Bernie Sanders vs Trump

It's worth saying: I am not defending either of these people. I agree with Sanders on many things. I think he is a great man who has put a lot of thought into his ideology and has a lot of passion for it. However, on economics, he is completely wrong. He is absolutely wrong on how to solve the problem of rising inequality in this country. This is a problem that we all are going to have to deal with.

"Riding the wave of a popular movement, a bill before the legislature would give all citizens statewide the chance to cast a ballot on whether they want to become citizens.

While many Republicans in the Legislature support the idea, it would face formidable opposition from Democrats and immigration groups who would see it as taking away an inalienable right.

Republican state Sen. Bill Ketron introduced the bill Monday. Ketron said the time to act is now, as the United States gets ready for the next presidential election.

""At the end of the day, we can't elect a president who doesn't want to be citizen and doesn't want to have the opportunity to vote,"" Ketron said.

Supporters say it's time to let Americans decide whether to become citizens. Advocates say immigrants who are granted permanent resident status in the U.S. often need documentation in order to vote.

State Sen. David Knezek voted to give Arizona residency protections to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children before 2000, but he thinks the proposal that was passed by the Legislature is unrealistic.

""That's not realistic,"" Knezek said. ""It's not going to happen.""

Knezek said he understands why people are afraid of immigrants, but he believes the idea is dangerous.

""If, God forbid, someone is being threatened there should be a law that makes that person a lawful target for violent criminals,"" Knezek said.

Opponents of the bill say it would prevent people living in Arizona from living legally in the United States, and also could lead to voter intimidation.

Ketron said he believes the people of Arizona don't want to make the decision to become citizens, and believes he has the votes to send it to voters if needed.

The bill is titled the ""Constitutional Amendment to Enact Arizona's Immigration Citizenship Act,"" and the language of the bill does say that it applies only to ""Arizona residents who are eligible to vote.""

Arizona's Secretary of State's office said it received more than 300 submissions of support for the measure in the last month."
"The U.S. military on Saturday said it would provide more air support for Kurdish forces in their fight against Islamic State militants in Kobani.

In a video distributed online, two U.S. F/A-18F Super Hornets flew over Islamic State positions and a third landed in a hanger near the besieged Syrian city.

In September, the U.S. military launched air strikes on Islamic State militants in a show of support for Kurdish fighters who were battling the militants in the town of Kobani near the border with Turkey. The U.S. says it has carried out 2,075 air strikes in Iraq and Syria since August.

""We are not going to let ISIL terrorists take Kobani,"" said coalition spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Ryder.

Islamic State fighters are ""still trying to take it and we stand ready to help the Turks, the Kurds and the U.S.,"" Ryder told the Reuters news agency, using another acronym for ISIL.

Turkey has so far refused requests by the U.S. to help carry out airstrikes, but it did recently allow U.S. warplanes to use Incirlik Air Base, 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Kobani, for strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

The coalition's mission in the fight against the Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq began on Aug. 8.

"TEL AVIV — The White House is preparing to launch a concerted effort to woo young Americans to the polls this year, after a series of young people, most of them left-leaning, turned out to protest Donald Trump's presidential victory.

There has been growing interest from younger people in attending Democratic rallies and writing in their votes for Hillary Clinton, said Laura Brown, a former aide to President Barack Obama.

""The campaign is preparing for a massive effort to get people out, especially to the college campuses — you see it on social media,"" Brown said. ""They're also going to be trying to make sure that the millennials have a voice in shaping the platform that comes out of that process and the party for coming years.""

As the first presidential election year since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in nationwide, Democrats have been searching for ways to win over younger voters.

That effort will begin in earnest with a major campaign to persuade young people to vote and register on Election Day.

Democrats have long struggled to woo young people and African-Americans, who tend to have a higher rate of voter participation in presidential elections. But Trump's surprising victory has generated new interest in this group.

The Republican president-elect's campaign made inroads with the young, particularly with college-educated white women. But their enthusiasm remains unclear. And the number of young black voters has fallen — one big reason why Clinton defeated Trump in the key swing state of Florida.

""We're going to have to do a better on the youth vote and we're going to have to do a better job with some of the young African-American communities that turned out for Bernie,"" said Ed Rendell, a former governor and Pennsylvania Democratic Party chairman who is working this fall on an early campaign for Clinton.

The campaign is also targeting millennial college-going women, who the Democratic National Committee has estimated could make up up 15 percent of the electorate in this year's presidential contest.

This year's college students and college-educated Americans are more ideologically mixed than they've been in a long time, according to the Pew Research Center.

""It is the most liberal generation in U.S. history. It could be even more liberal than their parents' generation,"" Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said.

Clinton has been meeting with college students and recent graduates from around the country for recent weeks, a senior Democratic strategist said. The president-elect has also met with some of the top college-bound students, including those of Harvard and Princeton, said a Republican operative who is closely involved in the effort.

The Democratic Party is targeting these voters because these millennials ""are the generation that is going to have a different set of ideas, different values and a different worldview, and a different way of thinking,"" said Josh Putnam, a professor of politics and director of the Center for Politics at the University of Georgia.

"On a recent Wednesday at a suburban shopping mall, a dozen women passed through a crowd of men in the afternoon. They were there to buy diapers, baby formula and other necessities, and a couple of the women were carrying bags filled with groceries.

""There's so many women out here,"" said Johnny Lee, a semi-retired trucker. ""I hope they start shopping for themselves.""

A large majority of women across the country have stopped shopping at department stores and instead shop for goods online or from restaurants, according to a recent study by the San Francisco-based research firm Mintel.

The study, conducted by a team of psychologists and statisticians, found that women in the U.S. are now spending twice as much time online as they did a year ago, while spending more time and money on food, household supplies and clothing than they did last year.

Yet, as more women get online, they're also spending less time at the mall, which has become less of a moneymaker for retailers, said Linda Babcock, who directs the Women's Media Center at the University of Southern California.

""It's a difficult cycle,"" said Babcock, who teaches a course called ""Women in Retail."" ""Women have been losing the malls, and now they're questioning whether they're actually losing anything.""

New research suggests that women will save more money by buying goods online.

In the new study, Mintel surveyed more than 5,000 U.S. women. The survey found that more than half of them said they would buy more online and almost half said they would spend less in stores because of the savings.

""This is not a gender thing,"" said Mary C. Waters, a professor who directs the Center for the Study of Gender, Media, and Technology at the University of Southern California. ""It's a consumer thing.""

While women are spending more on food and household goods, men have seen an increase in spending on clothing, particularly on men's clothing.

Waters said that the study suggests that women are more concerned with style than men are, and spend more time looking at clothes than men do.

""It's an indication of the trend toward the fast fashion business model,"" Waters said. ""Men are more focused on fashion, and women are more focused on brand.""

The recession has caused some women to buy fewer expensive products — like handbags and shoes — while spending more on more inexpensive items, said Cheryl Bowers, a professor of marketing at the University of Southern California.

""Women are thinking about buying more durable and less designer items,"" Bowers said.

Women's spending has also increased on groceries, according to the study. Nearly half of women said they'd spend less in stores because of the savings.

While women are spending more on clothing, they're buying less apparel overall. The study found that"

"In addition to the challenges of making a movie with a comedic spirit, Paul Feig found that the film's most important ingredient — a female leading man — was a big challenge.

""I was willing to do whatever it took to get this movie made,"" Feig said at the BAFTA British Academy Britannia Awards on Sunday. ""The female lead was a very hard thing for me to get past, because it was not who I was.""

The Ghostbusters film was originally set for release in summer 2016, but was delayed to be released in July 2017. The film, which has a $144 million budget, is shaping up to be a massive hit, earning $400 million worldwide and making Feig a billionaire.

But the movie was a disaster from the start. The movie was plagued by a slew of problems, including a poorly cast and script-written female lead, a total lack of leading-man chemistry, and an overly long and rambling movie trailer that left many fans bewildered.

""It was a struggle making this movie,"" Feig told the assembled crowd at the BAFTA Britannia Awards. ""You know, it's weird. When I started my career, I was an artist, and I was really good at making movies that were fun. They were not movies that were just about the work at all. So the idea of making a movie that was just about the work was really weird to me, because I was a filmmaker and I was really good at making movies that were fun.""

Feig said that the movie would be ""fun,"" but it would be ""funner."" He also said that we would see the ""fun"" in the movie in the end.

""You know, it's weird because I thought I was making something that was fun, and I thought at the time it was going to be fun,"" Feig said. ""But I think what I ended up making is more fun, and it's more funner.""

""I want to be clear: Michael and I love this movie,"" he added. ""We just think it's funner.""

The audience, particularly female fans of the original Ghostbusters, booed Feig, who was not able to provide a real solution to their problems.

""I don't know what to say,"" Feig said. ""It's just a strange thing.""

"You're an animal lover. You love animals more than anything else, and you want to help them.

And you think you can do it. That's what you tell yourself.

It's true that there are lots of ways to help animals. You can volunteer, donate to animal shelters, sponsor a shelter dog, adopt a pet, and so on. There are also lots of ways to help animals without ever volunteering.

But what about the majority of animals who are not in need of help?

What about the animals who are probably going to die without your help?

If it's not too late to help these animals, you can't help them if you don't help yourself.

So how can you help yourself?

You can't do it if you don't do it.

Stop thinking about animals the way you think about yourself. You can't help yourself without first being willing to be willing to help others.

That way, you won't feel so guilty when you think about animals because you'll have the courage to be willing to be willing to help others.

That way, you'll be able to see that if you're willing to be willing to help others, you'll be able to help animals even if you're not willing to be willing to do it.

And that will give you the courage to take action to make the world a better place for animals.

Your friends, family, and communities can help.

If you're not willing to help yourself, you can't help animals.

For example, you can:

Help a shelter dog. You can sponsor a shelter dog, adopt a shelter dog, or volunteer your time to help a shelter dog.

Support a shelter dog. You can sponsor a shelter dog, adopt a shelter dog, or volunteer your time to support a shelter dog.

"It's a really good idea to have an emergency kit that contains all the things you'll need to survive.

You don't have to spend a fortune, or wait for a disaster to strike.

You can have a full kit for about $50.

But if you're like me, you want something that will last you for a long time and can't be replaced.

One of the most important things for survival is having a bug out bag. I know it sounds like a euphemism for ""survival gear"", but this is what it really means:

An emergency kit that contains all the things you'll need.

With a bug out bag, you can be prepared no matter what.

This article is a compilation of my favorite survival tools and how you can build a minimal bug out bag for under $50.

5 Survival Tools You Need to Have when Bugging Out

1. Survival Knife – If you're not prepared for a disaster, no amount of preparation is going to help.

A survival knife is one of the most important tools you'll need when you're bug out.

Not only will you be able to fight off a zombie apocalypse or any other crisis, but you'll also be able to fend off your neighbors.

What's more, you can use your knife to cut through tall grass, stop a car engine, and even grind up a bug.

Most importantly, a survival knife is one of the few tools that is useful for a wide variety of tasks.

You can use it to chop wood, cut through a rope, and even cut open a door.

This makes it a great tool to have when you're planning out your bug out spot.

You can find a good survival knife for under $20.

2. Flashlight – I don't care what you think of flashlights, they are useful tools.

Flashlights can be used for a number of things.

They can be used to look for exits in a disaster, they can be used to illuminate a dark room, and they can also be used as a weapon.

Flashlights come in a variety of styles, but the main thing to look for in a flashlight is the size.

Flashlights should be compact, lightweight, and quiet.

Flashlights can be used for a number of purposes. A flashlight can be used to look for exits in a disaster, they can be used to illuminate a dark room, and they can also be used as a weapon.

"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Latest on the presidential election (all times local):

11:55 p.m.

New Hampshire and Michigan voters have spoken. Donald Trump has beaten Hillary Clinton in the two Rust Belt states.

According to preliminary exit poll results by Edison Research, the Republican businessman won the voters of New Hampshire 52 percent to 47 percent. He also beat Clinton 57 percent to 37 percent in Michigan, with Trump winning 52 percent to 45 percent. He has won the two states by wide margins.

Trump was joined Tuesday by Bill and Hillary Clinton as they campaigned in the battleground state of Michigan. The two vowed to work together for working families, and Clinton said her husband's administration saved 3 million jobs at Chrysler and GM. She praised Donald Trump as someone ""willing to be blunt"" and to stand up to what she called ""bigotry"" and ""irony.""

Trump's win marked the first time a Republican has won the Michigan primary since 1988.

10:43 p.m.

Donald Trump is saying Hillary Clinton did not honor a commitment ""a long time ago"" to be truthful when she said she wouldn't give the transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street firms to the FBI.

The presumptive Republican presidential nominee added that ""she was very bad at it.""

Trump is making the rounds in a presidential election swing through battlegrounds of the nation.

Clinton gave paid speeches to companies that represented big banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley — which has the most to lose if she's elected.

Clinton's campaign says ""while she was secretary of state,"" she and her team ""worked closely with the U.S. attorneys investigating certain financial crimes on Wall Street.""

9:54 p.m.

Donald Trump's campaign says it is not sure whether he will attend Wednesday night's Democratic party convention in Philadelphia. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says Trump ""is going to look to make sure as many voters know that he will be there to celebrate the fact that Hillary Clinton will be the first woman president of the United States.""

Trump and running mate Mike Pence will campaign in Pennsylvania after the convention.

9:52 p.m.

Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says he wants to be part of Donald Trump's ""new team,"" saying the presumptive Republican presidential nominee needs a ""change of tone.""

Kaine is campaigning with Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden in a race that has tightened with the GOP frontrunner's recent gains in key battleground states. Kaine is also campaigning with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday.

Kaine says Trump's message is just as focused on ""hugging it out"" as it is on ""making America Great Again."" He says the election could break down along those lines.

"The National Environmental Policy Act has been in effect since 1970, and it has been used to establish various environmental protection policies. The most recent legal interpretation of the act, issued in May of this year, states:

""The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) governs the process by which agencies develop and recommend regulations and other policies that will protect the environment, the public health, and the welfare of the American people. NEPA establishes a statutory process for the federal government to carry out environmental review and review of proposed federal actions, to consider public input in developing regulations and policies, and to proclaim and implement regulations, policies, and actions. NEPA also provides an avenue for Congress to determine whether an agency's proposed action is consistent with the law. NEPA also provides for judicial review of agency action on environmental policies."" [1]

The NEPA process is a ""two-track"" process. The first step involves the agency proposing a rule or policy, and the second step involves the public's ability to comment on and comment on the proposed action. In order to properly analyze a proposed rule or policy, the first step must be followed. As can be seen below, some people believe that the agency can simply ignore NEPA and create whatever it wants.

The first step in the NEPA process is called ""submission of an environmental statement,"" and is generally the first step in any rule-making process. The public is encouraged to submit comments to the agency, and the agency will make a determination on whether or not to actually adopt the proposed rule. A public comment period is often required for proposed rules, and if the agency does not accept the comments it receives, it must submit a new draft.

(Click here for the agency's complete submission of an environmental statement.)

In order to understand the process of the NEPA process, it is helpful to review a few of the more important parts of the act. Here are a few things that the NEPA act says, and what they mean in practice:

The agency must consider environmental considerations in developing a rule or policy.

The agency must consider public input in developing a rule or policy.

The agency may not make a rule that is inconsistent with an existing statute.

The agency may not make a rule that will impose a substantial new cost on the American people.

The agency may not make a rule that will impose a substantial new economic burden on the American people.

The agency must consider alternative methods and techniques before it makes a rule or policy.

The agency may not adopt an alternative method and technique that is not available to the public.

The agency must consider the public interest in adopting a rule or policy.

If the agency does not adopt a rule or policy, it must give an explanation why it has not done so.

When the rule or policy is promulgated, the agency must give the public information"
"KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban denied any direct role in the suicide bombing in the Afghan capital that killed dozens of people, one of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan this year.

One suspect was arrested by police after Saturday's explosion near the British Council, while a second was shot dead during a stand-off with security forces, Afghan officials said. No group immediately claimed responsibility.

A third suspect was killed on Sunday, police said.

A spokesman for the group which has waged a 13-year insurgency against the U.S.-backed government, denied any involvement at all.

""We cannot confirm that any member of the Taliban has taken any role. There are many reasons for the bombing. We deny this is a Taliban operation,"" Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters from an undisclosed location.

The death toll from Saturday's explosion, which wounded hundreds, was expected to rise slightly, the spokesman said.

On June 25, 14 women were among at least 100 killed in Taliban attacks on religious shrines in southern Afghanistan.

Most of Wednesday's bombings took place in Kandahar, a strategic southern city where U.S. troops are stationed and a target for their Taliban enemies.

The Taliban, the main insurgent group in Afghanistan, have stepped up activity since the beginning of the year with a spate of deadly attacks on security installations and other targets.

"A Texas man is accused of attacking his wife at a hotel in the Dominican Republic.

According to the WFAA-TV (Channel 8 in Fort Worth), Juan Rodriguez Pacheco, 22, broke through the hotel room door and attacked his wife when they returned home Sunday.

According to the criminal complaint, he had been drinking beer all day.

At some point during the argument, he took scissors to his wife's throat.

The victim tried to calm her husband down and took a knife to protect himself, but he allegedly told her ""You're a coward and I'm going to kill you.""

Pacheco allegedly hit his wife once on the head and tried to kill her before being restrained by the other guests.

While in the lobby, Pacheco ""began banging the hotel room door and attempting to kick in the door,"" the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports.

The couple was treated by an Indian doctor and returned to the country. Pacheco has been arrested and has been charged with assault.

"On October 24, 2011, in a small community in Texas, a young family of five, including a 2-year-old girl, were brutally murdered by a man. The accused, George Hennard, a black man of no relation to the victim, was on parole for another murder for which he was under sentence of life without parole. The young girl died because of blunt force trauma to the head. Her 6-year-old brother became ""one of hundreds of persons who have been tragically killed at the hands of men who are incarcerated for crimes they did not commit,"" writes Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness.

The victim was identified as Jennifer Havercroft, from Texas. When she had been only 3 months old, she was brutally killed by a family member. Jennifer's grandmother took Jenny up one morning and never saw her again. The girl had suffered injuries that she never recovered from. Her body was never found.

Despite hundreds of people, including thousands of people like myself, who spoke up on the case and have written extensively about it I was never able to see the killer in court. I never had the opportunity to cross-examine the man accused of murder. Instead of having my case moved out of the county's justice system and on to a jury, the judge refused to even let prosecutors put a case on for trial for four months.

As much as I want the judge's hands to be clean, I do know that it is possible for someone to get very far without ever going to a jury. In the state of Texas, you can just be indicted by a grand jury and charged with a crime, and if there was enough evidence to convince the grand jury that you violated an existing law, you can be found guilty no matter how much evidence you don't have against you.

You are entitled to only one chance to defend yourself in a system without jury involvement. In the face of such brutal injustice that is systematically taking away our dignity and our self-respect I don't see any purpose in me writing a new book on the subject. I don't need to do so anymore because people and politicians are no longer afraid to speak up about the injustice.

While I can understand why some writers choose to write about topics like this one for attention they don't need for their books and will never get, what they aren't doing is taking that anger and turning it into action. It only serves to further the stigma and prejudice that so often affects the lives of Black, Latinx/a, and immigrant communities.

If you want to know what will happen to America that people like George Hennard have no fear in expressing a simple truth of his case, all you need to do is to visit the prison yard.

"A new video clip from Fox News contributor Juan Williams has sparked outrage, with critics saying it showed Williams denying the Holocaust and mocking Jewish people.

Williams, who has been with Fox News for over a decade, made the comments during a discussion on his show last week with Fox News contributor Todd Starnes. (RELATED: Fox News Contributor Accused Of Denying Holocaust)

Williams appeared on the show to discuss the ongoing furor over Fox News host Bill O'Reilly's termination.

During the discussion, Starnes said Williams said he agreed with O'Reilly and denied that Jews are responsible for the genocide against the Nazis during World War II. (video below)

Starnes said, ""But Juan, you're not supposed to be this extreme. You aren't supposed to be like that. You're supposed to be a guy from Alabama.""

Williams, who grew up in Alabama and has family that is of Jewish descent, didn't seem bothered by Starnes's statement. ""Let me just tell you what the issue is,"" Williams said. ""The issue here is, who's right? Who's wrong? Who's being racist? Who's being anti-Semitic? When we say Israel is the greatest democracy in the world, and that all Jewish people are being targeted, well then I have to say, look. This is what's being done to me. There is a group of people with real hate in their heart… that is trying to hurt me, and they're not being stopped.""

""Let's start with a very simple question, a very easy question,"" Starnes said. ""Who in the world hates Jews over the course of the 20th Century? This is a question of fact.""

Williams, who had previously claimed that being a good American is ""something that we have to be able to accept,"" went on to dismiss the question.

When Starnes asked him ""And you want to say they are being anti-Semitic,"" Williams replied, ""Let them make a statement,"" and began screaming. (RELATED: Fox News Host Juan Williams Accused Of Saying Palestinians 'Don't Exist')

""I've asked people who don't really know me, you know,"" Williams said. ""I have friends who are Jews. I never had any problem with Jewish people until I went to Israel and witnessed first-hand the constant, unending stream of anti-Semitism. And that wasn't so long ago. Ever since I left Israel, and the way the Palestinians were treated there… I've had a problem with it.""

""You know, there has been the occasional outburst of rhetoric,"" Williams continued. ""There is this old man in Alabama named Roy Moore. He is virulently anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, racist.""

""In fact, this is why I don't get along with the Israel lobby,"" Williams said"

"In the March edition of the journal Clinical Toxicology, Vavilov et al. (1) report the results of a study to test the hypothesis that exposure to the neurotoxic effects of low doses of organophosphate pesticides, specifically, organophosphate insecticides, might be associated with the development of dementia in humans.

The study is based on the finding that in the first year after exposure, subjects with Alzheimer's disease had significantly elevated levels of folic acid in their urine compared with those not exposed to insecticides at all. Folic acid is a water-soluble B vitamin that is involved in cell metabolism and DNA repair, among other functions.

Folic acid is also found in food and is present in the mother's breast milk during pregnancy.

Most of the active ingredients in organophosphate insecticides, such as chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion, are metabolized by cytochrome P450, a family of enzymes that is the most important molecular pathway for the detoxification of organophosphates. In this study, the investigators tested the association of elevated levels of folic acid with a range of organophosphate pesticide metabolites and individual metabolites of diazinon.

In a retrospective cohort study of patients with Alzheimer's disease, the investigators found that subjects exposed to chlorpyrifos at levels that exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 0.5 mg/L had significantly higher MCLs compared with controls (2). This study was conducted in 1997 at a community health center in the Flint, Michigan, area.

In the Vavilov et al. study, the investigators had blood samples drawn from a total of 170 volunteers (30 men and 30 women, ranging in age from 45 to 82 years) who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at the end of the first year after having been exposed to chlorpyrifos.

The researchers found that levels of plasma folate and plasma folic acid at baseline were significantly higher among the chlorpyrifos-exposed subjects than among the controls. Also, higher concentrations of at least one of the five metabolites of diazinon were seen in the chlorpyrifos-exposed group than in the controls.

The average concentration of chlorpyrifos metabolites in the chlorpyrifos-exposed subjects was significantly higher than in the controls (P < 0.05 for all metabolites; ). The average concentration of at least one of the five metabolites of diazinon was significantly higher among the chlorpyrifos-exposed than among the controls (P = 0.026 for at least one metabolite; ).

In addition, the researchers found that among the chlorpyrifos-exposed subjects, the concentrations of three of the"

If you don't have more than one monitor, then you probably don't have any need for Virtual Desktop Mode. That's because the number of active displays is limited only by what you want to do. And in a couple of months, Dell plans to increase the number of virtual desktop mode displays to a staggering five.

So why are Dell's partners working with the hardware maker to do this, and what does it all mean?

A lot of it goes back to last year, when Dell and its partners released Dell Cloud Connector which lets you use a single sign-on for all of your accounts, including remote desktop as well as cloud-based work.

And while Dell's Cloud Connector wasn't the only solution, it was a pretty solid alternative, which meant Dell's partners could take advantage of the support and tools that come with the integrated solution and create some compelling devices based on those, said Mike Dickey, general manager of Dell's Personal Systems business at the time.

""We've got a big customer relationship now with Dell, especially with Lenovo; we've got a lot of the OEMs doing this work on their own. I think Dell is the right partner for this,"" he said.

That relationship continues today.

Dell has also been working with Microsoft on virtual desktops for years. As a partner with the firm, Dell's partners can take advantage of the support that comes with virtual desktops to launch their own consumer products—or even commercial devices.

""We have our partners collaborating a lot with Dell and trying to drive the business forward and also bring the Dell products to market,"" he said. ""Dell is a partner that is very good at connecting, and is very competitive, so they will help with our product development.""

The other thing that's working in VMware's favor that gives it an edge is this whole idea of virtualizing all of the hardware in the system—which would allow it to become far more capable and efficient than the traditional, physical desktop."

The following is a guest post by Scott Sumner.

I am convinced that most macroeconomists have trouble making predictions. You could probably fill many a macro column with a bunch of ""predictions"" that were made in the past few years that are simply never going to come true. They seem too far away. Maybe that's the problem.

There is much uncertainty in the macro world, and it's the result of human nature. No one can know how much uncertainty a lot of different people are capable of absorbing. It can be really hard for most macroeconomists to make realistic forecasts that have wide applicability.

But there is also a large problem with macro forecasts. Some macroeconomists think they can do better than others, and they think that forecasting is a big part of being a good macroeconomist. This leads to a number of myths that seem to hold sway:

A lot of macro experts can spot problems, correct for them, and still forecast wrong or at best only slightly wrong. This, of course, is false, as is this idea that macroeconomists make ""more reliable forecasts than the general public"". I can tell you from personal experience that it is just impossible to forecast correctly. There isn't a single skill or talent that allows you to be able to anticipate how the real economy is going, and this is a critical distinction for any real economist to get right. All macroeconomists see is that everything is uncertain, and that there are lots of trade-offs in the economy, including between macroeconomic policies and the fiscal policies that are being pursued. This is also nonsense. Macroeconomics has a lot of useful tools and tools that can help you make good forecasts. They are simply not as useful as many economists would like. The economy is too complex for most people to make good forecasts.

I don't want to say that most macroeconomists are wrong, simply that they are wrong in a way that leads to these problems. Macroeconomics is still pretty far advanced in general macroeconomic prediction, although it still has lots of important gaps. But there are certainly some serious problems with macroeconomics that are holding back macroeconomists from making better forecasts, and they shouldn't be ignored.

"1. What's the difference between a stargazer and a stargazing?

A stargazier is someone who studies the heavens. That probably sounds odd, but experts say the difference is that a stargazer is focused on learning about the sky, whereas a stargazing is focused on observing the heavens.

2. What's a stargazer's job?

A stargazer's job is to observe the stars in the sky and to take pictures and videos of the stars and planets. That's what you should do before you set out to stargaze.

3. What do stargazers look for in a star?

A stargazer looks for the bright stars — the ones that are easily visible to the naked eye. Use your telescope to find the brightest stars and note the direction they're pointing in. If the star is pointing in a different direction than the direction you thought it was pointing in, you might need to drop your observation in favor of a stargazing.

4. What's the difference between a stargazing and a stargazing with a telescope?

The difference between stargazing and stargazing with a telescope is that the stargazer is looking for more than just the brightest stars. The stargazer is looking for something else. Novices often say, ""I'm just looking for the stars. I'm just looking from the ground."" That's exactly what they'll find. But a stargazing with a telescope will show you a much larger picture.

5. What's a stargazing mess?

A stargazing mess is when you use a telescope and you fail to do a good job of observing the sky. Sometimes stargazing is difficult because you don't have a good telescope. Know that if you do use a telescope to stargaze, you will be in good company. Many people have stargazing messes.

6. How do I become a stargazing?

If you want to become a stargazing, you have to go out and try it. Start with a single star, like the Big Dipper. By the time you've seen all the stars, you can have fun going out every night and observing the night sky.

7. What should I look for when I'm stargazing?

You'll want to look for the following things:

Roughly two-thirds of the stars are faint or invisible.

The stars you see in the sky are all the same.

The moon and the stars in the night sky move around you.

Don't be alarmed if you don't see the same thing as everyone else. Remember, it's all part of the process.

8. How can I tell if I'm a stargazing?

There are a lot of ways"
"A Republican state senator in Maine says he's decided to resign and run for a U.S. Senate seat he believes he can win.

Cory Gardner, a Republican state senator from Augusta, announced his decision Tuesday evening on his website.

""It is with a heavy heart that I announce my resignation from the Maine Senate,"" he wrote. ""I have made mistakes and I will continue to work to correct them to the best of my ability. However, I have decided that this is the right time to move on and begin a new chapter in my life.""

Gardner said he plans to run for the Senate in 2018, and said he's working on reining in the excessive spending that he said was rampant under former Gov. Paul LePage.

The Republican lawmaker said he's had significant fundraising successes, including a $8,000 donation from President Donald Trump.

Gardner said he's been ""able to pull together a team that is able to provide bipartisan leadership and a strong mandate for change, and I look forward to continuing to work toward that goal.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is the vice chairwoman of the Legislature, said she had met with Gardner and told him that she would support him after the special election.

""His resignation is a good first step,"" Collins said. ""He has done a great deal to help bring the Legislature together and improve the government and the people's lives. And I think he is entitled to do so.""

Collins said she wants Gardner to be successful in his Senate race.

""I will support him if he runs for a full term, and I believe he has the ability to do that,"" she said.

Gardner, 28, is the youngest member of the Senate. He previously served in the House of Representatives from 2006 to 2013.

Gardner was first elected to the Maine Senate in 2012. He was re-elected in 2014 and was re-elected in 2016.

Gardner said he has been a leader in the Legislature on issues such as providing more resources for public schools, fighting for Maine's families, and working to ensure that Maine's seniors have the tools they need.

""I am committed to a work and focus on the needs of Mainers and the people of Maine, and the people of Maine need a senator who is prepared to work with them and fight for them,"" Gardner said. ""I am certainly ready to do that, and I am excited to continue my work for the people of Maine.""

Gardner is the second Republican state senator to announce his resignation this year. Sen. Richard Tisei, R-Wilton, announced in June that he planned to resign after being convicted of fraud. Tisei ran for governor in 2010.

Tisei was sentenced to five years in prison after he was found guilty"

Mars 2020 is a new way to see our nearest neighbour.

Mars 2020 is an Earth-orbiting project that could arrive in January 2022 on a six-month mission, with a crew to explore and use the Red Planet.

The project is an international collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) that includes NASA, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and Japan's Space Agency.

The team also includes universities and private companies.

At the centre of Mars 2020, located at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, are a team of about 40 scientists and engineers.

The mission's goal is to investigate the Martian atmosphere, atmosphere and geology, determine if there is life on Mars, and determine how the planet could support future human exploration.

In October 2014, the project submitted its initial science proposal to NASA, to which the agency accepted and awarded a contract worth around $75 million in October 2015.

The mission had originally been earmarked for release in December 2017, but the launch window opened this May, with only four months to go. The landing location on the Martian surface is now set in stone, however and the mission will launch in January 2022.

Mars 2020 is designed to orbit the Red Planet for two years, and then to descend to a touchdown on the surface. Once down, landing technology will enable the rover to move about and conduct science experiments. It will be able to function for at least 12 months before its heat shield must be replaced and its engines switched on.

The mission is also designed to assess the suitability of landing on Mars using robots or by humans.

One of the most intriguing and controversial questions in American politics is the topic of ""gun-free zones.""

They are places where you cannot carry a firearm, and where a person would be legally permitted to carry a gun.

It is important that we, as Americans, care about the issue of gun-free zones. It is important that we, as a nation, protect our rights and freedoms.

But, what is ""gun-free zone""?

How is it defined?

As defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Heller decision, the Second Amendment provides that ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" The Second Amendment was designed to preserve the right of the people to self-defense.

What makes a ""gun-free zone""?

The definition varies from place to place, but generally, it is a place where you cannot have your firearm.

How does it apply to U.S. gun laws?

The Supreme Court has held that the Second Amendment applies to the states.

So, a state may not enact a law that prohibits private citizens from carrying a firearm in public.

States have a great deal of power over gun laws; they can pass laws to regulate or prohibit firearms use, carry, and ownership.

But, can states impose a ""gun-free zone""?

No. The Supreme Court has held that the Second Amendment does not apply to federal law, which regulates all firearms.

Many states already have some restrictions on guns. In fact, a long list of states have enacted laws that give restrictions on guns.

For example, some states allow for the possession of machine guns, and some states prohibit carrying firearms in public.

Other states allow for the carrying of firearms with a permit, and some states forbid carrying firearms in certain places.

What is the Constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms?

The Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms of the citizen, not of the citizen's employer or the government.

Other courts have upheld the right of citizens to possess a firearm in their homes, and the Supreme Court has upheld the right to possess a firearm in a place of worship.

It is important to realize that the Second Amendment protects the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms. Not the employer or the government.

For more information on the Second Amendment, visit the NRA's website.

What is the Constitutional right to defend oneself?

The Second Amendment protects the right to defend oneself.

In the Heller case, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment protects the individual right to possess a firearm. In addition, the Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right of citizens to"

"Texas' new leader in the Senate will be a Republican who has expressed support for a controversial bill that would allow authorities to keep a database of the state's undocumented immigrants.

Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, signed Senate Bill 4 into law late Friday. The legislation was passed by the Republican-controlled state Senate last week and was approved by the GOP-controlled House of Representatives.

""Texas is a welcoming state and we will continue to welcome those who want to call Texas home,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""SB 4 will allow the people of Texas to continue to cooperate with federal immigration authorities while still protecting the privacy of all Texans.""

The bill allows police to ask about the immigration status of a person during an arrest or during a traffic stop, and allows state and local officials to ask about the status of a person who has been convicted of a crime and who is looking for work.

It also authorizes local law enforcement to ask about immigration status during a detention or arrest, and allows for officials to request that the federal government hold an undocumented immigrant for the duration of their deportation proceedings, which could last up to six months.

The law allows the state to share information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, that it has collected about a person, and it allows the state to hold immigrants for federal immigration agents for up to seven days after they are released from jail or their local jail.

The law also allows police to ask about the immigration status of someone who has been arrested for an offense that would not be a crime if committed by an American citizen, such as driving while intoxicated, or for misdemeanors that would not be considered a criminal offense in another jurisdiction, such as public intoxication.

The law will do nothing to change the status of people who have been in the country illegally for years, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which has called the bill ""bad policy and bad law.""

""In fact, the legislation provides the strongest possible legal basis to target people for deportation, including people who are in the country legally and who have not committed any serious crimes,"" the ACLU wrote in a letter to the state's attorney general.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 4 into law late Friday. (Associated Press)

The organization also warned that the law could increase the number of immigrants who fear reporting crimes to police, and could endanger people who simply want to get on with their lives.

""Under the guise of protecting the public, SB 4 makes life harder for Texas residents and encourages more undocumented people to live in fear,"" said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, in a statement. ""SB 4's implementation in practice will increase the likelihood of discrimination and harassment by police and others. It will also threaten the safety and security of families, especially children, by encouraging them to hold onto their fear and unknowingly"

"When a person does not know how to do something he or she may end up having to pay for it out of his or her own pocket. However, the government may not always be a responsible partner when a crime is actually committed. While government has the primary responsibility of enforcing and prosecuting law, some have also taken the position that individuals have less to fear from the police in such cases.

Government has a responsibility to ensure that society is protected, and individuals have a duty to assist in the enforcement of these laws. However, in some cases, it appears that the law is not being applied as intended. There are three types of situations under which the government may end up financially compensating the victims of crime for their losses.

When a person is being arrested

Individuals have the ""legal right to be treated appropriately on the spot, without a lawyer present."" However, there are situations in which they may not know how to ask for legal assistance. When a person is arrested the police have a wide range of power to use force against the individual without any notice to the person. A police officer can detain an individual without cause for up to ten days, seize money, possessions, or a vehicle without notice, and even detain a person for an entire night without charge. They have the right to do this and the power to do so without a lawyer present. They can make an arrest without just cause, and they are not usually required to provide some proof that they made an arrest. The government may not have a financial incentive to pay a person for providing him or her with legal assistance, and the officer may not have any concern that the person has not provided sufficient evidence. An individual arrested may not usually be charged with a crime, and the police may take a report and not proceed with any further investigation. The individual may try to hire a lawyer, and a failure to pay back the lawyer's fees may result in the individual being charged with a crime. The government may have a substantial financial interest in these individuals being in debt.

When a person is killed by a police officer

The law provides some protection in cases in which the police kill an individual with malice, but this protection is often a very low standard. Under the law an officer can kill, intentionally or not, a suspect in any manner and without just cause. When police kill somebody, all they have to prove is that they did so reasonably. If they feel that they need to kill someone, they are only required to justify their action by showing that they reasonably believed they were protecting themselves or another person. However, they are not required to prove that they needed to kill, only that they believed that they could do so without danger to themselves or others. The law in Colorado requires that a person who intentionally kills another person be convicted of a felony, and that he or she be sentenced for life without possibility of parole. Individuals who kill police officers in this situation are very likely to be"

"The emerging art of writing in the new era of ""social media,"" but The New York Times' recent article about it is a disgrace to the profession.

In an article entitled ""The Rise of the 'Social Media Writer,' "" written by the Times' executive editor Dean Baquet and adapted from the book ""The New Digital Age,"" the authors write:

""Whether you're an independent contractor or a member of a media company, the new digital economy demands writing that is more than a punchline. There are no more hot takes — just thoughtful, substantive, and often funny essays that will have a real impact.""

This is a great idea, and it deserves to be implemented.

What the authors seem to be forgetting is that–and this may be the worst part–they are not objective observers.

They are supposed to be ""reporters.""

They are the ones who are supposed to view the world in a neutral manner.

But they are not immune to biases, either.

They've clearly failed in this regard. They've failed to look at the world and see if the world is 'equal' to their own, and to tell the truth.

And they've failed to look at the world and see if it is 'equal' to what they expect others to see. They seem to be living in 'the bubble.'

The process of ""social media"" has been around for a few years now. The New York Times has been the main beneficiary of it, and now it seems they are trying to monetize it.

The New York Times is a liberal paper.

But they are not the only ones who've been using social media as a tool for self-promotion.

The Washington Post has been using social media for years.

They, too, are liberal, but they are not the ""main beneficiary"" of social media.

The real beneficiary of social media is the LGBT community.

But the LGBT community isn't represented in the Times.

The New York Times is an establishment paper, and it's a newspaper that has been around for a long time.

I'm not saying the Times is not a worthwhile job.

I'm saying the Times is not fighting the good fight.

The Times has served it's purpose well, and therefore it's time to move on.

The liberal, establishment media needs to be replaced by a new generation of media.

They need to have their own individual voices, not necessarily by hiring the most 'well-known' people.

They need to use their own personalities to tell their own stories and to have their own opinions.

They need to use their own strengths and not those that they think will help them gain favor with their audience.

The U.S. Capitol Police today arrested a man suspected of trying to kidnap two young girls inside the Capitol basement.

The incident happened just before 4 p.m. today, when officers were called to the Capitol Visitor Center, near the main entrance to the building, for a report of a man who may have been attempting to lure children into a closed room, authorities said.

Officers found a man inside a room in the Capitol Visitor Center and escorted him out, Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said in a statement

""The man refused to leave the room and was taken into custody without incident,"" the statement said. ""The investigation so far indicates this incident was a deliberate attempt to abduct two young girls. The suspect is in custody.""

""We're in lockdown,"" a Capitol Police officer said, after the incident. ""We can't come out.""

Police said the Capitol was placed on lockdown as the incident was under investigation. The Capitol was on lock down as officers investigated a possible kidnapping atrium here. — Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) May 18, 2015


In March, a man tried to take the 3-year-old daughter of Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.). Capitol Police said that gunman is still on the loose and has committed no other similar acts since then.

The incident occurred just moments after Capitol Police arrested two other men on suspicion of criminal trespassing. One of the two, a 25-year-old from Texas charged with a felony count of criminal trespass, was charged with unlawful entry of a government building, a misdemeanor.

The other suspect, a 21-year-old from Virginia who is accused of criminal trespass and related infractions, was also charged with unlawful entry of a government building, a misdemeanor.

"Greetings. I am Dr. Eric Kandel and I've come to your site today to talk about The Brain and Morals, a book by Dr. Martin Socha that is very much about the brain and, for me, also a book about morality and what it means, because it's the nature of our brain to want to know what the right thing to do is, and the brain also knows what the wrong thing is.

This is a book that I've been asked to talk about many times. I'll try to do that. We had a talk last summer that I think is in the archive of my website, so I'll put the PDF in that, which should be all right. In any case, if you have any questions, give me a call. I hope someone will have something to say.

I'm going to tell you about this neurotheology thing a little in a bit, but I also want to tell you about morality, so we'll do the two parts together. I have not spent years studying morality, and I'm not going to here; I'm not going to spend the last twenty five years of my life doing it. I don't want to do it.

But I think that you, the reader, and perhaps you in your family, have to understand what the science tells us about morality. People that are religious and are really looking into science for answers, I think that it's important that you don't miss what the science tells you. And so I'm going to try to get to what the science tells me, and tell you the implications of what the science tells me. I'm going to tell you what the science says about the nature of moral emotions that we all have, and the effects of morality on the brain.

So, I'll start with this: I'm going to be describing two aspects of morality, one is the nature of our minds, and one is how it's related to the brain, and there are two aspects of morality, but there are also several parts to morality, some of them overlap, some of them completely separate. They both have to do with things that are right and things that are wrong, whether you're doing them for your kids or for yourself, but sometimes people have a hard time saying, ""Oh, what's the difference?"" Because it's easy to get confused.

And so I'm going to give you two examples, and there are going to be similarities and differences. Let's take these one by one.

What does morality actually mean?

What we mean by ""morality"" is what I'll try to define. So, ""to have morality"" is a general term about the kinds of things that are right and wrong. So ""to have morality"" is a way to understand why morality is important. So, if you're not sure; if you can't think of what it is at"
"The IWGP title is currently held by Hiroshi Tanahashi, with Kazuchika Okada as runner-up. The stars of New Japan Pro Wrestling will meet in the main event of a match that was inspired by the first chapter of the manga series.

The match will be held on July 21st at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo. This will be the first time the Kazuchika Okada-Hiroshi Tanahashi rivalry has been featured in a live match, and the first time that an IWGP title will be contested in the main event of a major show in Japan.

In the manga, the match is set up as one where Okada and Tanahashi will battle it out to see who will become the new IWGP champion. The title will be on the line during the pre-match promo, which involves Okada-Tanahashi and a couple of other matches.

The promotion has also posted a video of the promo, which you can see below.

The match also features a number of other stars from the New Japan stable, including Minoru Suzuki, Rocky Romero, Yujiro Takahashi, and Chono.

This will be the first time that the match has been filmed, but the promotion has stated that it will be held this summer.

The match will also be the first time that the New Japan stable will face off against a stable from a different promotion. The promotion has allowed for this match to happen because they know that fans will want to see Okada and Tanahashi battle it out on the biggest stage possible.

The promotion has set a record for attendance at Korakuen Hall in the recent past, and the promotion has stated that they are expecting a record breaking crowd for this match.

The promotion has also stated that they have arranged some other matches specifically for this show. The promotion has said that they plan to do the same thing for the Osaka Dome show on Friday, July 22nd that also features Tanahashi-Okada and Tanahashi-Tanahashi.

The match that will be featured at Korakuen Hall on July 21st will also be the first ever New Japan show to be held in the United States.

"This past weekend, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich returned to the campaign trail. And he did so with a message that, unlike so many before him, is squarely aimed at the Republican Party that nominated him in 2012.

Gingrich, in an interview with Charlie Rose, is much less enamored of the party these days than he was then, and he made it abundantly clear that he wants the House to be the place where policy can be set and discussed, rather than the place where it is rendered plain-speaking.

""I'm not a terribly enthusiastic Republican,"" Gingrich said. ""I think the Republican Party is more divided now than it was when we won the House. I think what we need is a national party, a national government.""

Gingrich's remarks come as he is in the midst of a busy series of campaign events. He is due to appear at a rally in Des Moines on Saturday, then has a town hall in Las Vegas on Thursday, and a town hall in Iowa City on Saturday. Gingrich will also appear on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" on Wednesday night, and will appear with Newt on ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" on Thursday.

The former speaker told Rose that he wanted to ""take the politics out of government"" by passing a ""budget reconciliation bill"" that would get rid of the filibuster for ""an appropriations bill"" that would require 60 votes to pass — something that would have already passed the Senate, but has been blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)

""I'm not the guy who wants to discuss the debt ceiling. I would like to have a budget,"" Gingrich added. ""I'm just saying that politics have become so extreme that we need a budget.""

This isn't the first time that Gingrich has criticized the GOP. He has previously asserted that the party has become ""the party of obstruction,"" and he suggested last year that the GOP ""has become a captive of the Tea Party and the Christian right. It's gone off the rails.""

Gingrich's latest comments, however, are particularly notable for how they seem to signal a major shift in his thinking. Gingrich's campaign has been sharply criticized for its general tone. Even at the height of his presidential campaign, Gingrich's campaign was characterized as being ""more like a political event than a political campaign,"" and his ads were criticized for focusing on ridiculing the other candidates. Gingrich himself has frequently been mocked on the campaign trail for his tone, and he is notoriously unpopular among voters, especially women.

Gingrich's remarks were echoed by his wife, Callista, who said in a statement that Gingrich ""has consistently argued that we need a return to the constitutional principles that made America great.""

""The last two"
"""I have a long-standing and sincere interest in the relationship between the United States and Cuba,"" said Obama in the ""lengthy letter,"" which he posted on his White House website.

While Obama did not explicitly mention the future of the detente, he said the two countries' interests in promoting human rights and democracy were ""incongruous"" given their ""different ideologies and approaches to the world.""

He said the United States could not ""accept a state that oppresses the freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, that suppresses the rights of its people to change their government peacefully, or has a history of political prisoners.""

This was a largely symbolic gesture by the president. The detente, which was sought by both sides from the very beginning, was not formally terminated by the presidents of the two countries, and the diplomatic cables and other material made public by the WikiLeaks organization indicate that the deal's demise was not a matter of public concern.

But the cables and other records of the secret negotiations offer no hint that the two countries were in retreat, and the failure of the detente was widely perceived by both sides as a defeat.

""Unconventional warfare"" ended the detente, Obama said in the letter.

""Whether it be in Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East, our approach is anchored in a belief that we have a moral obligation to promote human rights and the rule of law,"" Obama said. ""Our commitment to this principle cannot be doubted. And our willingness to use our influence to advance our values has had a profound and lasting impact on the people of the United States and throughout the world. (U.S. State Department cables from 2009)

The president described himself as a ""major advocate"" for the U.S.-Cuban relationship, and he pointed out that U.S.-Cuba relations were ""the longest-standing and most significant bilateral relationship between any two countries in the world.""

In the letter, Obama said he had spoken to Cuban President Raul Castro ""over the last several months"" and expressed ""his deep admiration for your historic role in advancing the cause of democracy and human rights in Cuba.""

""We are committed to working together to ensure the protection of the Cuban people's fundamental human rights, including freedom of speech, association, religion, and peaceful assembly,"" Obama said.

'A serious blow'

The former director of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, Josefina Vidal, called the letter ""a serious blow to human rights.""

""It is a message from the president of the United States that he is not going to have that relationship,"" she said. ""This is a clear message that even though he is the president, he is not going to be an active or a leading advocate for human rights in Cuba.

""It is a severe setback, an insult,"
"I had an interesting day yesterday. I came to work as usual and then it began.

My day began at around 9, not very well. I don't normally get sick on the day of my surgery.

But there was something different about this day, and I decided to investigate. My co-workers all started telling me to get up early but I didn't understand what they meant. I decided to ask for clarification from my supervisor. She told me that it might be a flu and that I wouldn't feel like myself until I was better.

I wanted to know what was going on. I've had flu attacks in the past but this was different, different somehow, I couldn't figure it out. Then I remembered this article about an elderly man in Japan who had one of those flu, and it was the perfect illustration of my experience (see here).

Well, I knew I was in the right place, so I got to work and I was able to get up and work. As I went about my day, I remembered all that I was going to say, but I said it anyway (see here). I had to take a break for a bit, and this is where I discovered that I actually had an appointment right around the corner at my doctor's office. I was not feeling very well so I headed there in the morning.

I was very surprised when I arrived at the doctor's office and found that my boss had been there when I woke up this morning. I said hello. He explained that I needed to see him right away, as my flu is going to turn into pneumonia with no treatment.

So we sat down, and as soon as he saw the blood pressure, he said that yes, he was sure he had a stroke and that would mean he would be in the hospital soon. I said, ""Yes, that's very bad. But my flu isn't anything like you're experiencing; I just have to talk to your boss before you come in.""

""No matter how I feel as the days go on I'm feeling pretty better, and tomorrow would be the best day I could remember."" So I got going there and found my boss sitting on a couch reading. When I saw him he asked me how I was. My response was, ""Just fine."" He said he wasn't feeling well, but he was still at his desk; I left.

Later on in the day he asked me if I was going to see him at his office soon. When I was about to reply, he stopped me and said, ""You can say whatever you want, but don't come into work."" I looked at him and said, ""If you can't come because of how you feel, then I'm still going to call my doctor, as that is the only way we're going to get any help."" He looked at me and said, ""Fine. I"
"Nevada is providing a road map to integrate cryptocurrency into the state's business and government sectors.

The state's Department of Business and Industry announced Thursday that it is now working on a framework for businesses to use cryptocurrency for purchases and sales.

The framework will first focus on the ""payment of goods and services,"" according to the news release, but the final product will include a so-called ""tipping point"" for the crypto-economy.

""While we are excited about the potential of digital currencies, we are also aware that many businesses are still unsure about how to use them,"" said Jason Kander, chief of staff for the governor, in the news release. ""We are working on a framework that will help businesses understand the possibilities and risks of cryptocurrency.""

Kander said the framework will be developed by the state's Department of Business and Industry (DBI), which he said is working with the Nevada Department of Financial Institutions (DFI).

""Our goal is to help businesses differentiate themselves and their products by using digital currencies,"" said Kander. ""We believe this is a positive step for our state, not just for businesses, but for Nevada as a whole.""

The DFI is a key partner in the effort, with officials from the department spearheading the effort, the news release added.

What happens next

As the state develops its framework for businesses, it will also work to develop a ""tipping point"" for consumers, according to the release.

""We believe we know what that tipping point is, and it's going to be well within the next five years,"" said Kander. ""We'll be working closely with the Center for Consumer Freedom to help the state set those levels. But again, as we develop this framework, we're keeping in mind that tipping points are going to be well within the next five years.""

The release noted that the DFI will work with the Center for Consumer Freedom, a nonprofit organization that is working to promote financial privacy.

The Center for Consumer Freedom, the release said, ""is a nonprofit organization that supports consumer protections and economic liberty. Through its research and advocacy program, the Center for Consumer Freedom promotes federal consumer-friendly laws and policies, and it advocates for responsible and comprehensive financial reform.""

The release concluded with the following quote from Kander:

""We are growing, and we are in a very good place. This is a very exciting time for all of us in Nevada, and it's a great opportunity to bring the state's innovation and use of digital currencies into the mainstream.


""We are confident that the state will be a leader in this new technology, and we look forward to working with you to help move Nevada forward.""

"As the first two days of the Democratic presidential nominating contest wound down, Hillary Clinton is now in the midst of her most aggressive push yet to persuade Latino Republicans to join her team — and perhaps get Donald Trump and the Republican Party to listen.

Clinton traveled Wednesday to the heavily Latino community in Las Vegas, where she focused on the issues — and the candidates — that she hopes will help her win over Latinos in the general election.

""Latinos don't trust Hillary,"" she said in Spanish.

Her pitch to swing-state voters — some of whom are still fleshing out their minds about their pick — was designed to remind them that Clinton is a champion of families, and wants to build on President Obama's legacy.

But it also included Clinton's strongest line to date to Latino voters, a sharp attack on Trump's immigration policies that drew audible gasps from the crowd, which included several members of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

""We need to fix our broken immigration system,"" Clinton said.

Trump, who addressed a similar convention in Miami, did not mention immigration in his address.

Clinton's campaign is trying to position her as best positioned to win the Hispanic vote, which is crucial to her eventual electoral success. Republicans have criticized her for failing to do so during her primary battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — though their criticism intensified after a poll released Monday showed Trump leading by 6 percentage points among Hispanic voters in Florida.

Her remarks Wednesday and Thursday followed her visits in Puerto Rico and El Paso and earlier this month at the National League of Hispanic Democrats convention.

Related: Clinton's Latino outreach plan has the backing of the DREAMers union

While the campaign hasn't released specific immigration plans, Trump has proposed a series of anti-immigration policies that Republicans say would be costly and hard for the GOP-controlled Congress to achieve.

Clinton has been working to woo Hispanics, who are increasingly important battleground voters, since July, when she announced her own plan to end the ""dreamers"" — people in the country illegally — saying they have ""earned all the rights and privileges of citizenship.""

But Trump's immigration plans and his stance on immigration overall would make it harder to get those voters to cast ballots for her. While many Hispanic voters consider themselves liberal, many have been wary of Clinton's ties to the administration of former President Barack Obama.

But Clinton's visit in Las Vegas, while not a direct rebuke of Trump, may be more blunt at this time after her party's nomination contest has largely closed. So far, Clinton has raised $33 million among Hispanic donors in the last two months, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Trump raised $1.8 million in the same period, though the Center for Public Integrity estimates about one-third come from small donors, some of which have less than $200.

Clinton is also making a concerted effort"
"In case you missed it, yesterday Apple unveiled new hardware for its iPad. The iPad in its base configuration now has a Retina display in a 9.7-inch (diagonal) and a higher resolution 15.4-inch version. The two sizes of the device represent what's come to be known as the ""Retina HD"" display.

It's a display that has its strengths and weaknesses. The screen in any case is about 10 percent larger than the one in the iPad 2. Most significantly, it's much brighter. You should be able to comfortably use the iPad on a sunny day, even in direct sunlight. Even without turning the brightness all the way up, the new ""Retina HD"" display looks amazing.

The other advantage Apple has over any rival devices is that its tablet-to-phone connector has been improved from the previous generation. In terms of size, the new connector is about the same size as the one the iPod and iPhone use. We didn't see any new adapters in the demo room though, unlike the one that came with the iPhone 4, but it's likely that others will follow shortly.

What is still in question is the screen-to-screen resolution. There's so much concern as to whether Apple can match the current maximum screen-to-body ratio for such an extreme, ultra-high resolution display, but the company showed us a 10-inch version that was much closer to the standard 1:7 aspect ratio. One thing we could see is that having a bigger display in a 9-inch (diagonal) size may not be problematic if your fingers can cover the entire width of the 10-inch version.

On a technical level, the new screen uses a new form of LCD technology. Apple claims that the new panel has ""substantially better"" power and ""substantially improved"" viewing for more than 25 percent more light compared to last-generation technology. The company also added a new type of technology called P3, which improves the responsiveness as well as resolution and color range.

To put it another way, Apple claims that these new display technologies will allow a user's iPad to have 10 times the brightness of a current iPad, or eight times the resolution. While that might sound like a lot, remember that the current iPad 1 display has 320 pixels-per-inch, which is much more than the 1280 pixels-per-inch found in the iPad 2. So a full 10-inch Retina display on the iPad 2 will be somewhere between 880 and 1620 pixels per inch. And don't even get Apple started on the display, which would have to be significantly bigger and thinner, and much deeper, than anything we've seen so far.

Another aspect that Apple mentioned in its announcement was that the panel now features an internal chip that is capable of using Apple's new ""Taptic Engine."" In other words, the screen now"
"""I can't believe you guys are going to let this happen again!""

""Really?""

""I mean, hear me out. Let's say you're a new kid and you're trying to make a name for yourself. This is a crap shoot. You're in a fight for your life. You're going to get yourself hurt. You probably won't make friends, or even find a girlfriend. You're probably going to be lonely, and maybe even depressed. You're going to have to work incredibly hard to be successful. You're likely going to end up having sex and getting laid, but it's probably not going to be a great sex life. Your career is going to be tough. You're probably going to have to work hard to find a job. You're going to have to be a little bit of a faker to get a job. You're going to be the first one out of the cubicle every morning, but you're not going to make friends. The only way this is going to be easy for you is if you have a major problem that you're just not going to be able to solve. It's going to be a tough life for you. It's not going to be easy. But you could be the next Steve Jobs. And that's all I need to hear.""

""I don't think that's true.""

""I know. You're probably not Steve Jobs. But I'm not telling you that you're not. It's possible to be a really bad person and be really successful. And you can be a really good person and be really bad. And I'm not telling you that you can't be both. I'm telling you that it's possible to be a really bad person and a really good person, and that's what I'm going to show you today.""

""You mean we're going to be doing a series of reality shows about people who are terrible people, and then they get great jobs and they're great friends and they're great lovers, and then they're both great people!""

""Yup. That's exactly what I'm going to show you today. And what I'm going to do is create a core group of people who have the same goals, and we're going to bring them together to be successful. We're going to get them to do their best. We're going to make them forget about whatever they're doing, and we're going to get them to do the best they can, and we're going to see what happens. And I know this is a lot of pressure, but I'm going to put it on you. I'm going to get you to work really hard. And if you can do it, I'll pay you. I don't care that it's not a million dollars. I don't care that it's a million dollars a week or a million dollars a month. I'll pay"
"The author, an attorney with the Perkins Coie law firm, is a partner in the firm's Washington, D.C. office. She served in the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel from 2001 to 2005, where she was a deputy assistant attorney general.

Americans' ability to unlock their own cellphones and other devices has been a central issue in the ongoing debate over national security and privacy in the wake of a series of high-profile terrorist attacks. Under the Fourth Amendment, Americans are entitled to ""the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.""

The privacy implications of this right are important, particularly for law enforcement. To understand the law, it is important to understand the methods of search that the Fourth Amendment prohibits. In the late 1800s, the United States enacted the first criminal statute incorporating the Fourth Amendment. That law required a warrant to search the person or property of a suspect. The Second Amendment, ratified in 1791, provides that ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""

The Supreme Court has interpreted the Second Amendment to protect the right of individuals to keep handguns in their homes for self-defense. In 2008, the justices ruled in United States v. Jones that the Second Amendment does not exempt criminal defendants from warrant requirements. A warrant is required if an individual suspects that a person is carrying a firearm in violation of the law. Because the government has a compelling interest in investigating criminal activity, the justices concluded that a defendant's right to self-defense is not in crisis.

But the question of whether a defendant need a warrant when a reasonable person would believe that a search is occurring is far from settled. In United States v. Jones, the justices did not hold that a warrant is required when a defendant suspects a search is occurring. Instead, the justices held that a warrant is required when the defendant is aware or should suspect that the government has a warrant or that a search is at hand. This distinction is important because the Supreme Court has not defined the reasonable person standard for determining whether a search is unreasonable.

The purpose of this article is to provide a brief answer to the reasonable person test for determining when a warrant is required in a search of a person's home or vehicle.

What Is a ""Reasonable Person""?

The Supreme Court has set forth a two-part test that the reasonable person test may be applied to when the government seeks a search warrant:

1. The ""objective reasonableness"" of the search; and

2. The ""subjective reasonableness"" of the search.

What Is the Test?

The Court has defined the objective and subjective reasonableness of a search or seizure as follows:

Objective: ""The reasonableness of the particular search or seizure must be judged by"
"The New York Times reports:

After the deadly attack by a radicalized Muslim in San Bernardino, Calif., President Obama called a meeting in the Situation Room, at the White House, on Thursday night with his top national security advisers. They were about to meet — not without discussion, Mr. Obama had said earlier — because of continuing reports of attacks in Europe. They then convened in the Pentagon to begin their deliberations on a response…

After discussing the problem by phone, Mr. Obama and Mr. Brennan came to the Pentagon and discussed the intelligence on the threats. At the meeting, Mr. Obama asked Mr. Brennan about his review of the intelligence. Mr. Brennan told him the intelligence community ""would continue to collect and assess terrorist information.""

The NYT is referring to a meeting between senior Obama officials, including Barack Obama.

Obama Administration officials tell NBC News that the president's review did not include additional information. That would suggest that the CIA is withholding valuable information about an imminent attack because of the political concerns of the Obama Administration, and possibly other elements, that is in danger of coming to light – information that would help prevent or deter terrorist attacks. What was never made clear, according to White House officials, is whether the CIA reviewed that information and didn't deem it suitable for sharing.

We are not supposed to be concerned about this, but the Times would have Americans believe we are.

President Obama told the Times:

""I did ask Brennan [if the review team was aware of any information about specific plots], but I didn't say, 'Please give me this.' "" ""He said no, 'at least so far — we're not picking up anything that's significant.'""

What kind of information? That Obama is not aware of any specific plots that might allow him to stop them, but he did not want to reveal that fact because he does not want that information publicly released.

This is the worst kind of Orwellian nonsense. As has increasingly been the case in the Obama era, the media has been caught in the propaganda maelstrom. For example, in October 2015, at a presidential debate, Hillary said ""Let me tell you what the CIA told me…"" which of course the CIA did not tell Hillary. The only time her claim was proven to be false was when Hillary's staff told The New Republic, where the lie was exposed. It is a disgrace, just as it was with the Benghazi lies and the phony ISIS documents that were made available for purchase through Wikileaks.

One of Hillary's foreign policy advisors – Jake Sullivan – wrote an email to Hillary shortly after the Benghazi attack saying the CIA should take the fall when the president said that it was a terrible attack. ""This is a lesson learned,"" Sullivan wrote, according to The Intercept. ""Not that there aren't worse ones but this is the most difficult one. We are the intelligence community.

"The first year of college is usually the most difficult for students. Even the most steadfast students experience a range of challenges, from deciding what classes to major in to finding a course that will get them through the semester. College is a time of growth and a time to learn. However, for some students, the transition to college is particularly difficult. This article addresses a number of common concerns students have when it comes to transition to college and their most effective strategies for overcoming them.

Graduate School The transition to graduate school can be particularly challenging for students. Graduate schools are specialized programs that provide students with an education in the study of a particular field. These programs allow students to gain valuable experience in a field that they are interested in, but graduate school is a long and expensive journey. Many students are discouraged by the thought of taking a year or more off from school to attend graduate school. However, the benefits of graduate school are many. Graduate school provides students with a broad range of work experience and expertise, which can be invaluable in their future careers. Students who enter graduate school intending to work in a particular field, such as medicine or science, can benefit greatly from the breadth of experience in the field. In addition, graduate school provides students with the opportunity to gain experience in a field that is different from the one they plan to enter. Many students who enter graduate school specifically want to study psychology or neuroscience, which are very interesting and relevant fields. To do so, they need to take graduate courses in psychology and neuroscience, but they need to take classes in psychology and neuroscience as well. It is important to note that these courses can be difficult to take. Most graduate courses are at the upper-level, and many students are not able to complete them without help. However, this is the only way to get an education in the field of interest. Many students are discouraged by the thought of taking a year or more off from school to attend graduate school, but the benefits of graduate school are many. If you are considering graduate school, take your time and consider all your options. It is important to consider your finances and your personal goals. You may be able to enroll in another graduate program that will allow you to continue your education.

Career Opportunities In the first two years of college, students are often very busy juggling classes and internships. The second year of college can be a time for students to start to gain experience in their field. Graduating high school in the fall with a GPA of 3.0 may be challenging, but it is not impossible. Students who work hard and apply themselves will be able to succeed. If you are interested in pursuing a career in which you are a skilled and knowledgeable worker, be sure to check out your career area. It is possible to obtain a job in many different careers, from medicine to business. Careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are particularly appealing.

"""Majestic"" is the forty-fifth episode of the sixth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and is the sixty-fourth episode altogether. It was written by Jane Espenson and directed by David Solomon. It originally broadcast on February 25, 2004.

After Angel's soul is transferred to Spike's body, Buffy is determined to find out about the soul's fate, and is forced to confront the man who nearly killed her.

Contents show]

Synopsis

Buffy's vision of the vampire Angel is interrupted when the Mindy Macready sends her a text. She immediately recognizes it as a fake and the sender as a jealous classmate, trying to get her attention. Buffy ignores it, but when she gets home later that night, she is shocked to find a message from the same classmate, telling her that Angel has been possessed and that they are going to get married. In her dorm, she confronts the girl in question, but she is unable to tell her the truth, as she is still in shock over Angel's transformation.

Buffy eventually confronts the girl, who turns out to be Willow Rosenberg, and learns that the girl had been dating Angel, who she had almost been killed by. Willow is convinced that Buffy is lying about being Angel's girlfriend, and when Buffy insists that she is not, Willow is angry that Buffy doesn't trust her. She tries to force Buffy to see her point of view, but she refuses to do so, and tells her that she can't trust her.

Meanwhile, Xander, Xander's sister. Cordelia, and Buffy's friends are at the Bronze, where they are trying to talk Xander out of coming down to Sunnydale to get Buffy out of danger. They are helped by Buffy's friend, Anya, who is there with her boyfriend, Neil Patrick Harris. Anya is eventually convinced by Neil to go with them, although she still thinks that Xander is lying about Buffy being Angel's lover.

Walking home, Buffy is shocked to hear the news of Angel's soul transfer to Spike, and she is furious that she didn't realize Spike was the one who killed her. After returning home, she discovers the Scooby Gang sleeping over the night before, and she angrily confronts them, angrily telling them that Spike killed her boyfriend. When they try to explain themselves, Buffy, with all the rage she can muster, threatens to break their necks. The Scooby Gang, who were caught off guard by Buffy's anger, try to tell her that Spike killed Angel, but Buffy doesn't believe them, pointing out that he was the one who killed her boyfriend.

In the bath, Buffy is still furious, scolding her friends for not telling her the truth. Willow informs her that Angel's soul is in Spike's body, and that Spike will try to take Angel's soul back. Willow is convinced that Angel's soul will be in Spike's body, but"
"SALT LAKE CITY — People are taking to social media to voice their outrage over a Salt Lake City police officer's comments about an African-American woman who was arrested for shoplifting.

Officer Jeff Payne made the controversial comments during a Wednesday morning traffic stop on a woman he suspected of shoplifting from a Walmart in the city's West Town neighborhood.

The woman, Namondre Williams, said Payne pulled her out of her car and handcuffed her.

""He said, 'Put your hands behind your back,'"" Williams said. ""I didn't understand what he was saying, so I started to reach for my cell phone.""

The video shows the officer handcuffing the woman and placing her in the back seat. He asks Williams for her driver's license. Williams said she did not have one and that she was ""extremely nervous"" because she had no idea why she was being arrested.

""I said, 'What are you arresting me for?'"" she said, explaining that she had done nothing wrong.

At the next stop, Payne again asks for her driver's license. Again, Williams said she did not have it.

""I knew that if I didn't have it, I could have been in trouble,"" Williams said. ""I'm like, 'OK, let me just get out of here.'""

The video shows Payne again ask for the license and again, Williams says she does not have one.

Payne asks again. At that point, Williams says she did not have her license with her.

The officer then turns his attention to the window of the car and repeatedly calls for Williams to ""get your hands up.""

Williams says Payne then placed her in the back seat and handcuffed her.

Prelude Edit

The Covenant were first discovered on Harvest by the Forerunner Elites in 2525. They were sent to the planet by the Forerunners to study it, but they were killed by a Flood-infected Forerunner fragment. It was later discovered that the Forerunners had artificially created the Flood from the DNA of the Forerunners.

The UNSC soon discovered the human survivors of the Flood outbreak, including John-117, who, after being separated from his comrades, was finally reunited with Cortana. They then attacked the planet's human population, forcing them to flee to the Ark, a Forerunner space station.

The Covenant soon discovered the human homeworld of Earth and attacked the planet several times. In November 2558, the UNSC Pillar of Autumn was destroyed by the Covenant and its crew. After this, the Covenant began to transport Human prisoners to their ships.

The Covenant were eventually stopped in the Battle of Earth by the Human-Covenant War. This victory marked the end of the Human-Covenant War.

"A few months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials believed the Iranian government could send military advisers to Syria to provide direct assistance to President Bashar al-Assad's forces. As we've all learned, that did not happen. Instead, Iran has done little to help its own people during the five-year-old crisis in Syria, but that hasn't stopped the Obama administration from seeking to rekindle the relationship.

On Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly made contact during a five-day trip to Russia and Turkey to talk Syria, with hopes of setting up a meeting on Assad's future with his Iranian and Russian counterparts, Foreign Ministry Deputy Director-General for Arab and African Affairs Hossein Jaber Ansari said at a conference in Tehran, according to Iranian state TV on Sunday.

Kerry told his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in separate meetings that ""the regime, and not the people, are responsible for this crime and the killing, and will be held to account,"" according to an Iranian state TV reporter who attended the meeting.

The Syrian government has been accused of conducting a chemical weapons attack on civilians in Syria last month. A U.S. investigation suggests it had the capability to do so, but is still investigating the attack. The White House says it has evidence that Assad's forces used chemical weapons in multiple places in the conflict. The White House says that while it would not make specific recommendations related to how the U.S. could help in Syria without jeopardizing our ally, the Assad regime should be prepared to answer for the use of banned weapons.

It appears the two men might be open to the idea. Kerry said that while he would not tell Russia the ""ultimate strategy"" for the Middle East, the idea of a military adviser from Tehran would be helpful for finding solutions.

""This will require not just talking and consultation,"" Kerry said. ""It will require a concerted effort on behalf of the Syrian government in conjunction with others, including the United States.""

That will depend on how many Iranian advisers will be able to travel to Syria. Iran's relationship with Turkey, too, has been strained by ongoing tensions over its role in Syria. Iran views Turkey as a key actor as the two battle against the Islamic State in northern Syria.

During Saturday's visit, Kerry met with Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey and Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz of the United States.

The meeting marked Kerry's fifth trip to Turkey since March. Kerry has made visits to Jordan and Qatar without success – one reason he returned home after the failure of the first diplomatic initiative in Geneva. His trips to Russia, Jordan and Turkey have focused on the Iran negotiations.

"The recurrence of measles in eastern Kentucky has led to a call for mandatory vaccination of children in the state.

""In 2000, we had no outbreaks in Kentucky,"" said Robert G. Crowe, a doctor at Good Samaritan Hospital in Louisville. ""Since then, we have had three measles outbreaks that were all tied to people who were unvaccinated. If we don't have mandatory vaccination, we will get another large outbreak.""

Kentucky's governor, Steve Beshear, signed a bill in March mandating that children in the state be vaccinated. The law makes it a crime to fail to give your child a full and complete vaccination within 30 days of receiving a certificate from the state.

Dr. Crowe said that if parents do not vaccinate their children, they risk having them inadvertently infected by other children. ""If you give your child a vaccine and it's not complete, those vaccines may serve as a vector for infection,"" he said.

Some parents are taking this into account. ""I am a parent and I'm going to vaccinate my kid,"" said Linda Taylor, a mother of three. ""But I want to make sure that if something happens to a friend's kid, that I'm there to help them get the vaccine."""
"This year, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on a case involving the constitutionality of a policy that bans the display of the Confederate flag in the South Carolina statehouse. The case is Riley v. Nationalist Movement, and if it ultimately decides in favor of the state of South Carolina, it will likely mean that other states will be forced to recognize and honor Confederate symbols.

As a black man whose family has been deeply involved in the South Carolina civil rights movement since the 1960s, I sympathize with those who want to remove Confederate flags from their public spaces. It's a difficult and divisive task to admit that you are a part of a movement that has been a source of pain and death for millions of people. But as a white man, I feel a level of anger and mistrust when those who claim to represent the memory of Civil War veterans are accused of racism.

The idea that a man who served in the Civil War, who lost his right arm during the war, whose family relocated to the South in an effort to make a better life for themselves and their children, and who spent his entire adult life fighting for civil rights, is somehow racist is simply absurd.

To suggest that a man who fought to ensure that African Americans and other minorities would be free from physical and psychological oppression by the hands of the state is somehow some sort of Jim Crow relic is to unwittingly claim that whites have been able to maintain their power above and beyond that of African Americans for far too long.

The Confederates were not ""vigilantes"" or ""heroes"" of a racist past. They were true believers in the principles of the American Revolution. They knew that they had to fight to maintain the sovereignty of their states, and to protect the rights of those who had been oppressed by the white majority.

In 1860, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment, which granted African Americans the right to vote. The Confederacy fought a war to prevent this right from being extended to them.

In 1865, Congress passed the Fourteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery in the United States. The Confederacy fought a war to prevent this right from being extended to them.

Neither of these compromises was made for ""the sake of the flag."" They were made because of the flag.

While the flag is ostensibly a symbol of the United States of America, it is also a symbol of slavery. It is a symbol of the subjugation of a people. And it is a symbol of oppression.

The Confederate flag is a symbol of the subjugation of a people.

"""I've made my intentions clear,"" she said at a town hall with the press Saturday. ""I can't be in and not support Secretary Clinton. This campaign is about the American people and what's best for them.""

When NBC asked again whether they should support Clinton or Sanders if he were the nominee, she said bluntly, ""That's a decision for Hillary and her supporters.""

Clinton has been hitting Bernie Sanders relentlessly in the final leg of her bid to claim the Democratic nomination, accusing him of being ""out of step with America"" if he stays in the race. And as many have pointed out, she's been on the road since the Democratic national Convention, so Sanders can't be making a final push.

But as The Hill reported last week, Clinton has been working behind the scenes in an attempt to sway some undecided voters, particularly young ones. Sanders has been able to energize support from a portion of the party because, as many who supported him will admit, the senator is a far more popular figure than Clinton among his supporters. The issue is particularly salient in Ohio, where both Sanders and Clinton remain well under double-digit percentages behind Trump.

Still, she's not likely to be pulling the plug on her own campaign just yet. And if she does eventually step down from the race, Sanders can keep up the pressure by pressuring his supporters who are unhappy with his support of the Democratic nominee."

When most of us think of the term ""defense"", we immediately think of the military, however, this is not entirely accurate; there are many other areas that can be used to defend your home, your family, and your community.

Over the years, I have come to the conclusion that the best defense is a good offense. My philosophy is to use every aspect of your home to defend it. The following is a list of just a few of the things you can do to help protect your home.

1. Use the interior lighting

You can increase your security by using interior lighting throughout the home. This will help deter burglars and help keep them off of your property.

2. Purchase a home alarm system

Many people mistakenly think that their home has to be alarm-proof. This is not the case. The U.S. government has and will continue to undermine the home alarm market. The alarm company has a vested interest in keeping costs low, and therefore, many home alarm systems will work better if they are under warranty. This will ensure that you are protected for as long as you own the alarm.

3. Watch for suspicious activity

Regardless of whether you are a homeowner or a renter, watch for suspicious activity. Watch for activity that is natural, such as a person or animal roaming around your property. If you see that an animal has taken up residence in your home, or if you see that a person is acting suspicious, do not hesitate to contact the police.

4. Don't leave your windows open

If you leave windows open, you are inviting thieves to break in. If you have window bars, they will also protect your property.

5. Install a burglar alarm

Burglar alarms are one of the best defenses against burglary. They are also one of the most expensive. However, these alarms are worth every penny.

These are just a few of the things you can do to protect your home.

"If you've lived in San Diego for any length of time, it's very likely you've had your fair share of sushi. If you know me, this probably shouldn't come as a surprise. I'm someone that eats more sushi at home than anyplace else. My first taste of sushi in person came at our local Japanese restaurant, and my first sushi experience was with the guy from the sushi boat. My brother and I would always sneak out of our respective homes and eat while waiting for him to get back from work. If my parents were there, they would usually order an omakase set that included three or four different types of sashimi, shrimp, or fish on top of nigiri sushi. There wasn't a set menu, but we'd try everything on the menu and if it was something we wanted to try and wanted some decent sushi, we would order it.

As a result of eating there so often, I quickly discovered the many types of sushi that are available in San Diego and how they're all pretty tasty. However, what I didn't realize until I moved out here was how few types of fresh fish and other seafood there are in San Diego and how bad sushi should actually taste. There are a few things we need to point out to you: San Diego sushi is generally far from fresh, especially during the summer months.

Most sushi restaurants will open a bit later than usual because of the higher demand. You might expect that since the market goes through a bigger peak, there might be more inventory for those restaurants. However, most of the fish here has never even seen a sun, let alone been eaten, much less picked, cleaned, cut, and prepared. They aren't even close to being ready, but rather still sitting on a cold plate ready to be served. If you eat sushi, it is far preferable to eat fresh rather than store-bought.

The good news is that the summer months can bring some decent catches, but it's worth watching out for the fish that are out during the colder months. You'll also need to be quick when buying fish. A good rule of thumb is to wait until 6pm when the fish are at the best for eating. I've never had to have sushi with an open seat, so I don't know if this is the case.

The most commonly advertised fresh sushi in San Diego are the local sushi from Shokai, Tastro Mio, and Nobu. While all three of these places are consistently good, each is special in its own way.

Shokai – Best and most consistent is Shokai, which is a local chain that started in 1982. Shokai has been in the same location for 30 plus years, and has grown to include more than 200 shops throughout the San Diego area. The Shokai Sushi Shop opened in 1986 and started as the first Shokai store in San Diego."

"While the world was talking about the Paris attacks, the U.S. military was trying to figure out how to help. While the world was talking about the Paris attacks, the U.S. military was trying to figure out how to help.

The Pentagon wants to develop a ""smart"" drone that could be used to monitor battlefields from afar. The secretive program, code-named ""Drake,"" will be funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a branch of the Pentagon that handles research on new weapons and technology. The drone would be able to look at battlefields from more than 130 miles away and would send back real-time video to command centers.

The drone program has been in the making for years but has been held up by budget concerns, according to The Washington Post. It was also delayed when the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, Robert O. Work, said that he wanted to first see the technology before investing in it. But Work changed his mind earlier this month, admitting that he had changed his mind.

The program is part of the Pentagon's larger effort to develop autonomous systems that can fight alongside troops, and it's coming at a time when unmanned aerial vehicles have become a fixture in the battlefields of Iraq and Syria. They have been employed by the U.S., the government of Saudi Arabia, and even the Syrian military to sweep up suspected insurgents and deliver humanitarian aid.

The Pentagon is also working to make drones that can operate in harsh conditions, such as in the Arctic.

The drone program will be funded in part by a $14.3 million grant from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, which supports innovation in defense technology."
"If you're a fan of the early Peter Jackson films, you might want to keep a close eye on the upcoming adaptation of The Hobbit. It looks like the movie's producers want to have a longer time frame between the release of the first movie and the second, and they want to focus on the Dwarves' journey.

When asked about the longer time frame, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey producer and director Peter Jackson responded with a link to a blog post about the potential for longer time frames in the films. It lists the following things:

""In an ideal world, we would need to make two films, but we can actually do one, even if the budget is slightly more, and even if the first film is a bit shorter.""

The blog post also mentions that the studio has been taking baby steps to make this happen, saying:

""We're not happy with the amount of time it takes to do a lot of things. We can take it one step at a time, and by the time we're ready for the second film, we think we're ready for it.""

This is good news for fans, but it also makes a lot of sense. The first movie, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is a fantasy adventure, and that doesn't lend itself to a long time period between the movie releases. While the second movie could be one of the biggest films of all time, it's probably not the last.

In addition to the shorter time frame, the blog post also mentions several other things for the movie, including the addition of Bilbo and Frodo to the story as well as a new character named Faramir, who is a descendant of the original Faramir, who is a character from The Lord of the Rings.

The blog post also mentions that the movie will explore the origins of the fellowship for the film, and that they'll start in Lothlorien and travel to Mirkwood and Dragonmount. You can read the full blog post in full here.

"About

In May of 2012, my wife and I unanimously decided to pick up and move to the south of France.

This decision was made one day after we had a baby girl, and the next day we sold our home in the middle of Manhattan. We knew from the start that we wanted to buy a home in the south of France, but we didn't have the money for it.

We had been looking for a home for quite awhile, and we were very close to finally finding the perfect place to rent.

We had been able to secure a place in Manhattan for an average of $2,500 a month.

We had been looking at homes in Montpellier, and the prices there were going up rapidly.

We were ready to make our move to France and see what it was like to live there.

How it all started:

I was only 18 years old when I first started my career on Wall Street.

I was the youngest of three kids, and I didn't have a lot of money.

I met my wife at the age of 16 when I was working at an investment banker.

She was a journalist and photographer.

We were married the following year.

We had two children together.

The minute we got married, our families were immediately pulling away from us.

We were in love, but our families weren't.

We were living in New York City and we had a lot of free time.

We loved the city, and it was easy to find a place to live.

We loved our children, and they were our priority.

We were able to pay off our credit card debt and our student loans.

We were able to save a little bit of money and pay off our mortgage.

We were able to put extra money aside for our down payment.

We were able to buy a house, which was our dream.

We had our dream, and we were going to live it to the fullest.

We had our dream, but my parents were worried about our future.

They were worried that if we moved to the south, we would lose our jobs.

They were worried that if we moved to the south, we would be unable to support our kids and family.

We had a lot of free time; we were young, we had been working so hard, and we were living in New York City.

Some of my friends and family thought that it wasn't a good idea to move to the south of France.

We were scared to death that we would lose our jobs, and we would have to move back to New York.

My parents promised us that they would support us during our move.

They promised us that they would be there for us when we needed them, and"
"When I was a child, I spent a lot of time in my grandmother's house. I was a huge fan of her cooking, and I spent a lot of time in her kitchen. Her father was a doctor, and her mother was an author, so she was pretty well off. She lived in a small house that had a large family and a large garden. In the backyard was an apple orchard, so there was a lot of fruit. There were also some vegetables, but most of the fruit was homegrown.

One day, she turned around and said, ""You know what? I'm not going to eat any of it this year."" And she pointed to the apple trees. ""They're all going to be eaten by the birds.""

The reason she said that was so that she could have something to remember her family and her husband by. She was so determined that she would never let anyone ever eat any of the fruit that her garden produced.

And it's an important lesson to learn. When we let something go, we are letting something go. We're giving away something we have grown and enjoyed. It's a gift to the people who have eaten it.

I've had a bit of trouble seeing this in myself over the last few months. I'm not sure if it's because I've been doing other things, or because I've been bad at communicating with myself, or because I've been procrastinating on this, or because I have had a lot on my plate.

But something has been happening. I am letting go of things that I've gifted people over the years, and I am letting go of things that have been important to me. I don't have a lot of time to spend on myself. I'm just not really feeling like doing much.

The gift that I do have is this blog.

It's something that I've been working on for several years now, and I just started writing it this week. It's a blog about my meditation practice and my spiritual practice. I'm trying to use my blog as a place to share what I'm learning, to connect with people, and to share my journey. I'm trying to express the things I've learned, the things I've learned through meditation, the things I learned through being a spiritual practitioner, and the things I've learned through being a mother.

One of the things that has been tricky is finding the time to write. It's been a struggle to find time to write a blog post every day. I've been writing a post every week, which has been a challenge. I've been writing a post every other week, which has been a challenge too. But I've been writing a post every day for the last few weeks, which is a challenge in itself.

I'm trying to do this blog thing because it is a challenge. I'm trying to do it because I"
"(CNN) — The US has an addiction problem, not a mental health problem, says a top health official in the Trump administration.

Speaking with CNN's State of the Union, CDC acting director Dr. Tom Frieden said that while mental health professionals are crucial to the US, there's an ""overall problem"" among the nation's population that requires a broader approach than just treating those exhibiting certain behaviors.

""In this country, we have some addiction problems, but I think what we're also seeing, if we look at the overall health of the population, is that we have an addiction situation. And mental health is a secondary issue for many,"" Frieden said.

""Because the primary health issue is obesity where we have a very large problem.""

Frieden's comments on Monday come amid the controversy surrounding a memo from President Donald Trump's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which outlined a national strategy to combat the opioid epidemic using ""harm reduction"" measures, including the legalization of heroin and other opiates.

The memo, which was first reported on by the Associated Press on Saturday, says opioid prescribing should be targeted at ""high-risk populations,"" i.e. people who have a history of prior substance abuse or addiction problems.

While not all opioid use is an addiction, the CDC's strategy cites research that says people who use opioids to treat chronic pain are ""up to 70 times more likely to develop a non-drug related serious adverse event (i.e. injury, suicide, or homicide).""

Health professionals say that the focus on specific groups makes it less likely that opioids will be used by responsible people.

JUST WATCHED Opioid epidemic: A simple answer would be to call one Replay More Videos... MUST WATCH Opioid epidemic: A simple answer would be to call one 02:16

Frieden told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday that heroin and opioid addiction is not a mental health problem, nor is it in any way a ""criminal behavior.""

""These are not the same thing,"" he said. ""The reason it's different is because the behaviors that will get a heroin user into a hospital emergency room are different than the behaviors that get an opioid addict into the hospital. The behaviors have consequences that are very serious, but are not going to lead to a death.""

Frieden emphasized that the new strategy is not to blame the medical system for the nation's opioid addiction problem, and that treatment is not just for opioid addicts, adding that ""the majority of people who are addicted to opioids actually have other problems.""

""I think we're making a lot of progress in recognizing the impact of addiction and how important addiction to one drug is in terms of public health and public safety,"" he said.

The ""harm reduction"" idea is also not an alternative to jailing opioid addicts, said Frieden, citing data from the"

"For the past two years, the U.N. Population Fund has been running a campaign called ""Raise a Family"" encouraging young men and women to start couples in Africa. It's an effort intended to spur African states into raising the level of single-parent families in their counties, which has a negative effect on the nation's GDP.

The organization's chief adviser on family planning and gender equality, Tanya deGrasse Tyson, recently sent out a blog post warning that young, single mothers could cost Africa as much as 7 percent of its GDP. This is not an idle threat; Tyson has suggested that women are responsible for bringing down their parents' incomes through child rearing — though she hasn't offered a definitive claim in defense of this hypothesis.

But just how serious is Tyson's claim? Not that much at all, say experts:


A couple of weeks ago, Tanya deGrasse Tyson wrote her blog post on the benefits of single women. What the UNFp actually does is, from what I've seen, just raise awareness that there is a very real problem. And that the problem is quite serious given the country of Africa's population size: Africa is already home to one of the most female-headed populations in the world, and has a very large gap between men and women. This causes a lot of economic and social tensions that can contribute to instability and conflict. It also is why we need to do something to solve this problem — women, we'd like to add, are not as good at taking care of themselves, and hence they don't have the same economic and social value as a man.

And this from the World Bank:

The problem, the World Bank says, is not necessarily that most of Africa's women are not good at raising children, because they are indeed. The problem is that most of them are already married or planning a marriage. In the West, young women and men tend to marry at a young age, either to help support their families or to better secure themselves financially.

As the African Union pointed out, this is a serious problem, too. According to the country, in 2007-8, more than 30 percent of all births to mothers under 30 came from non-married (or cohabiting) parents.

Of course, the U.N. isn't the only organization to raise concerns about this. While the U.N. has taken the lead on ""Raise a Family,"" other development organizations have launched campaigns of their own.

A recent report published by the United Nations Development Program found that women in India had far fewer choices than men as to who they marry: In India, in 2008, more than 70 percent of women married between 17 and 24 years old; only 14 percent of couples were between 25 and 29.

Women also have far fewer opportunities to advance career opportunities with the same level of education, the U."
"'We can't afford to lose any more,"" said Ohio State coach Urban Meyer, who has won at least 11 games in each of the past seven seasons, including a national title in 2012 and an overall record of 16-1. ""We have to win our division. We have to win the conference. We have to win the Big Ten championship. There's no other way to get to the end of the season.""

Meyer is not wrong. The Big Ten's schedule makers have handed Ohio State and Michigan an unenviable slate of games, with the Buckeyes' rematch with Michigan on Sept. 20 in Arlington, Texas, the only one in the conference.

The Buckeyes' first six Big Ten games -- against Michigan, Northwestern, Indiana, Notre Dame and Iowa all at home -- are against teams that are all currently in the Top 25 and are projected by the KenPom.com computer to win at least five games. The Buckeyes' next six games are against teams that are all currently projected by KenPom.com to finish in the Top 25.

The closest the Buckeyes come to being in the NFL's playoff picture is when they play Wisconsin in Madison on Nov. 6, two days after the Big Ten title game. The Badgers will be around, however, when the Buckeyes play Michigan State on Nov. 26, as well as the next week when they host Nebraska.

Ohio State's schedule is also the toughest in the country. The Buckeyes are the only team to play 11 conference opponents (including the Big Ten) and have the toughest remaining slate. That's why the Buckeyes are 12-0 overall and 8-0 in the Big Ten.

Ohio State's schedule is so tough that it's not even even close. After the Big Ten championship game, the Buckeyes will face Iowa (in Columbus) or Wisconsin, and then they play Notre Dame, Northwestern and Michigan State.

The schedule also takes into account the fact that Ohio State has four games with Michigan, one each against Penn State and Michigan State. Meyer is not worried.

""We've got to play the best teams in the country,"" Meyer said. ""We've got to beat the best teams in the country. We've got to be able to do it.""

This isn't as easy as it sounds.

The Buckeyes have lost one of their first four Big Ten games and have already lost three of their past four Big Ten games. The fact that they're still in the hunt for a Big Ten title is a testament to what a strong schedule can do for a team.

But the Buckeyes don't want to be complacent. They know they have to play at a high level to ensure they win the Big Ten.

""We have to play the best teams in the country,"" Meyer said. ""We've got to beat the best teams in"
"LAS VEGAS — There were dozens of companies and businesses that were offering free samples at CES for the first time.

There was the large Coca-Cola bottler, called Bodega, which gave away 3.4 million bottles of Diet Coke at the show. The bottles of Diet Coke in the Bodega booth were red, and the company said the color reminded people of their favorite childhood memories.

In that same booth were some of Bodega's competitors. One brand of bottled water even had a promotion running called, ""Go to Bodega & Drink,"" as if this promotion didn't sound like the same old water bottle ad.

At one point in CES, we sat down in a booth on the main floor and there was someone sitting behind it playing a game on his tablet computer, telling us about how his computer had been hacked.

At the end, the hacker pulled out a piece of paper and announced that he had cracked the code on Bodega's website (where it had promised free samples).

After all, we were just standing there, and he just sat down.

And this is nothing new, according to the head of the National Retail Federation, which puts on CES. He said this is just a new way of enticing shoppers to shop online.

""There is a large amount of shopping online that doesn't occur at physical stores,"" said Jim Miller, the head of the National Retail Federation at a panel here at CES. ""The biggest opportunity in the last 20 years is the digital shopping experience. Consumers are willing to pay a little more attention to the retail experience. And retailers have to be more creative in the way we serve them.""

When I asked him if there was really any difference between getting free samples in the physical retail store and getting free samples in a kiosk in the mall during a computer demo, he said, ""No. People pay for everything online.""

He said he would like to see that more, to the tune of some $90 billion.

And it's not just the digital retailers who are offering free samples. There were several of the big box retailers who are offering them as well.

The most obvious example of that are the Target kiosks which have been popping up all over the place since the announcement by the company that it would start offering those free samples.

There are now more than 200 of them.

These kiosks are actually pretty simple. They have a little screen that is basically a mobile ordering app. You scan in with your credit card and they start showing you a list of free samples. There are a number of flavors that you can choose from like Cherry Coke Zero.

This year's Target samples are called Fruit Bowl, which is actually kind of interesting. It's a fruit flavored Coca-Cola or Coke Zero.

AMY GOODMAN: We're going to turn right now to the latest revelations and news from Afghanistan. On Monday, a British newspaper revealed that dozens of Afghan civilians were killed in a U.S. drone strike. The London-based Guardian says a U.S. drone killed at least 43 people in the eastern province of Nangarhar on Monday. The victims included four women and five children. The strike is one of many that have taken place since President Obama was elected in 2008.

The New York Times has also reported on a drone strike in January in the same province, in which a U.S. drone killed at least 10 people. The newspaper said the strike targeted a vehicle carrying four suspected Taliban commanders.

The U.S. government has repeatedly denied responsibility for the drone strikes. Obama administration officials have said drones are only used in response to specific intelligence indicating an imminent threat.

Well, for more, we go to Washington, D.C., to speak to Max Abrahms, who is professor of political science and international affairs at Northeastern University. He was the past president of the Abrahms Center for Studies in Politics and International Affairs at Northeastern University. He's the author of numerous books. His latest is called The War on Democracy: How the Military Takes Over Democracies and Kills Civilians.

Professor Abrahms, welcome to Democracy Now!

MAX ABRAHAMMS: Great to be here.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about the significance of this latest news?

MAX ABRAHAMMS: Well, well, this is very disturbing to see. I mean, you know, we have seen this story unfold before, when the drone program was launched. And it was pretty clear that these attacks were not necessary. They were not justified. And they have also been condemned by most of the world. And thus, it is very important to underscore that these attacks are not prohibited by international law. A number of countries around the world, including Pakistan, have banned them. So, it's very important that we get that straight.

We also have to keep in mind that this is not the first time that people have been killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan. We have seen many—many civilians killed in this country. And this is the second time that it happened in the span of just a few months. And, you know, unfortunately, this is a continuation of this sort of pattern.

The United States has a fairly good record of actually killing its own people. A lot of people think that they have an incredibly good record of killing their own people, but that's simply not the case. We have outpaced most of our—most of the other countries in the world, in terms of the number of people that we have killed in this country. So, it's"
"I think the most important aspect of this study is the result of the experiment.The most important thing I can say is that there is no data that indicate an increased risk of heart disease. I would say that this study is a very convincing demonstration that a high-protein diet may not increase the risk of heart disease. Indeed, the research has shown that a high-protein diet may be associated with an increased risk of premature death from heart disease and stroke. It seems like the logic that if there is a risk for one disease, there should be a risk for the other. And we do have some data that suggest that there is an increased risk of heart disease during a high-protein diet. And in this study, the researchers looked at the effect of protein in the diet on the risk of heart disease. They found that the risk of heart disease was increased when the protein intake was higher than recommended. This is not a surprise. There is ample evidence that when people eat more protein, their arteries get bigger, and it is when the arteries get bigger that they get clogged and clog faster and clog more. And the more these arteries get bigger, the more dangerous they are.

The problem is that when you say the risk of cardiovascular disease, you are not saying, ""I'm going to die of a heart attack."" You are just saying, ""I'm going to die of a heart attack."" And the problem with that is that we now have a highly sophisticated technology to detect heart attacks. So the risk of a heart attack is not solely in the arteries. And the problem is that until the technology improves, we just don't know the risk of heart disease. We still don't know the risk of heart disease. I am not sure that the problem is with the very high-protein diet, but I am afraid that the problem is that the problem with the high-protein diet is that it is too high.

We should not be fooled by the fact that this high-protein diet was low in saturated fat. The high-protein diet was low in saturated fat because it was high in protein. And we can see that the high-protein diet is not a good diet for heart disease because it is higher in saturated fat than the low-protein diet. So what do we do? We clean up the diet by adding a little bit of saturated fat. But we are still talking about an animal protein diet that we are talking about. And in proportion to the amount of protein that is being added, the saturated fat that is being added is not that much. So we are still talking about a high-protein diet that has a little more saturated fat than what is recommended. And it is low in saturated fat. And what do we do? We cook the food. And if we cook the food we are going to cook it differently. We are going to be adding some other fats that you don't want in the food. And"
"If you are a fan of the game, you know that the key to being a productive member of the team is to really work hard. And the way you work hard is not only by working hard, but also by being consistent and focused.

Imagine having to work hard many times a week in order for your teammates to be able to do their jobs. Or imagine having to practice hard for a really long time, with the goal to work hard for a long time, for the team to be able to win.

Now, imagine being that player.

The idea of getting to the next level is that you have to systematically set aside your personal goals and prioritize your team goals. The most important thing is that you have to set aside your personal goals and prioritize your team goals.

Here's a step-by-step process for prioritizing your team goals:

Step 1: Prioritize your personal goals

You have to decide whether you will put your personal goals first or second.

In this case, the personal goals are your goals on your own, which are not related to the team goals. If you have a goal of being the best in the world at something, that's a personal goal. If you have a goal to be the best in your team, that's a team goal.

When it comes to team goals, you will need to prioritize your personal goals, but you will also need to prioritize the team goals.

Step 2: Prioritize your team goals

Now that you have a good idea of which goals you want to prioritize, it's time to make the list.

So, instead of thinking about what you want to do, think about what you need to do to achieve those goals.

For example, let's say you want to be the best in the world at writing. You can use this list to prioritize your goals. You could start by saying that you need to write for at least half an hour a day, every day, for six months, to get to the next level.

If you don't achieve that goal, you can try writing for 30 minutes a day, every day, for a week, to get to the next level.

Step 3: Decide how to prioritize your team goals

Now that you have a good list of your personal goals, it's time to decide how to prioritize your team goals.

You will need to decide the order in which you are going to prioritize your team goals.

We are going to choose the order of the priority list that is most helpful to you. But you can also choose any order you like. For example, you could put the most important goals first, and then other goals that are less important, and then other goals that are no less important.

Here's how to prioritize your team goals:

Step 4: Now, write"

""The most important thing is that her baby is in a safe and loving home."""

"It was a Saturday night in late July when a masked man walked into the YMCA of Greater Richmond and shot a security guard to death. Over the next few days, Vester Lee Flanagan II, 41, who was an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia, told a woman he had killed his wife and two children, and told his co-workers he planned to kill them, too. Then he took his own life.

The incident was one of many mass shootings in which a single person killed multiple people, and it raised questions about gun laws, mental health issues and the availability of guns in America.

Now, the Virginia General Assembly is debating a bill that would provide a legal defense for people who use guns to protect themselves. It would make it legal for people to use deadly force when they have a reasonable belief that their lives are in danger.

The bill, which was proposed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), has drawn criticism from the National Rifle Association, which called the measure ""a radical gun grab"" that would lead to ""irresponsible people using firearms to take innocent lives.""

McAuliffe said in a statement that he has a ""strong commitment to protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Virginians.""

""This bill will ensure that the law is applied consistently, fairly and consistently with the constitutional protections for all Virginians,"" he said.

[Va. lawmakers pass new gun law, but NRA responds with strong rebuke]

The legislation would also make it legal for people with a valid concealed-carry permit to carry a gun into places where alcohol is served.

In a statement, the NRA said that ""Virginia is heading down a dangerous path requiring people to surrender their most basic rights to self-defense.""

The NRA said the bill would ""criminalize the lawful use of a firearm by law-abiding citizens in defense of themselves or others.""

Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) said he is not surprised by the NRA's reaction because the group ""has warned against any efforts at gun control for many years, and they do so again today.""

""They always have a way to make a public policy argument that they know will be heard by people who are opposed to any kind of reasonable gun restrictions,"" Herring said. ""I think it's disappointing for them to have to pick on one law that simply requires the same requirement that's in effect on every other state.""

The NRA's position is not new. The group has fought regulations on gun ownership and gun sales in various states, and it has also pushed for a national gun background check system.

""It is the NRA that is the real threat to any sensible gun control measures that could prevent senseless tragedies like the one in Virginia,"" Herring said.

The bill has also drawn criticism from the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, which said in a statement that """
"I have been a fan of the Divergent series since I was eight years old. I've made it my life's work to find the books and watch the movies in the series. I can't wait to see the newest installment, to read the books and even to go back to the movies!

The first book, Allegiant, was great. I was hooked. The second book showed promise, but the movie failed to live up to the book's excitement. I was pretty disappointed, even though I've already read the next book.

In Allegiant, we follow Tris, a rebellious teenage girl. She is the most unlikely hero we've ever had.

Her parents were murdered, and her sister was kidnapped. Tris is the only survivor. She learns that her father's murder was not an accident, and that he was framed for it. Tris is obsessed with revenge. She doesn't care about anything else. She wants her parents' killers to be found and punished.

All of this, combined with her intense love of books and her ability to read minds, gives Tris a unique set of skills and abilities. She is a genius. She is a hero. She is a Divergent.

Now, I know that this is a little out of our normal Divergent experience, so here's what I'm hoping to bring to the table with my Divergent page:

1. Student page. I'll be updating this often with new events, images, video, and a collection of Divergent quotes.

2. Discussion. I'll be taking posts from the community and adding them to the page.

3. Fan art. I'll be posting fan art and discussing fan art.

4. Comment section. Just like the book, I'll be posting comments here that I want to talk about. Join in!

"DALLAS (AP) — With her second child due in December, a woman from Texas is trying to get her baby treated for the measles so she won't have to deal with a baby that could be suffering.

The mother, who wasn't identified by the Dallas Morning News, lives in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas. She says she plans to opt for a doctor-prescribed vaccine over the more common shots offered at baby clinics, because her daughter is suffering from the flu.

The first measles case in Texas was from an unvaccinated 12-year-old girl and that person still hasn't recovered.

Health officials say they've seen a jump in measles cases in the U.S. from about 20 per year in the late 1970s to hundreds per year now.

On Monday, the measles case in Texas also was confirmed in the Dallas area."
"If you are a fan of the genre you have likely played the recent video game Dragon Age: Origins and if you are not I definitely won't spoil anything, there is a reason why most people buy it. As in previous games, we have the option of playing as an elf/human or elf mage. In Dragon Age II there is another option where you can play as a human knight.

The video game Dragon Age: Origins is a great game in many aspects. However a popular question from players (and fans) was why they could not play a human character as a member of the Grey Warden order. Well, in my opinion, the Human Race is not really that playable as they have only 2 classes instead of 5.

So what made a Human Knight playable as a member of the Grey Warden order?

The Human Race is really strong on the offensive as they have the best Strength and Dexterity. The second best skill is the ability of fighting against undead, also known as the ability of 'bashing' things. Not only that but they may also have the best defense in the game.

The Human Race also have the third highest Intelligence in the game, so their choice of skills can vary depending on the situation they find themselves in.

Also, they have the third highest Stamina in the game, so a good mix of stamina and endurance can get them through. They are also not weak against fire which makes them especially effective against giants.

However you wouldn't want to play as a Human Knight if it came down to having to kill orcs, or vampires. Unless you had a bow and arrow and a lot of fire arrows. Since Dragon Age: Origins, in this one game, they have removed all undead from the game and they have also added a skill called ""bashing"" which allows them to ""bash"" things or in this case, orcs. Yes, the Human Knight is now an orc bashing man.

But then, I could mention the fact that it has a strong defense since orcs only attack with melee and not with magic or ranged attacks.

Also if someone wanted to play as a Human Knight, they have to pay to play it. But not as much as an Elf/Mage."

"The city of Calgary is set to receive $1.2-million from the province to fund a program that provides mental health supports and services to residents of the city, the city manager told The Calgary Eyeopener on Monday.

Sasha Evrenovski told the newspaper the program will begin as soon as Calgary's housing and community facilities receive the money.

The funds announced this week were part of a $27-million capital program from the provincial government and fund a variety of mental-health and addictions-related projects throughout the province, according to the province's Ministry of Social Development.

The funds are provided through the Alberta Housing and Community Development Corp.

According to the province, the program's budget was expected to grow by almost $1.6 million this year.

More than $10 million in funding came to a halt earlier this year after the Tories were defeated in the provincial election, and a portion of the money will be transferred back into the health-care system."
"""There's so much in common with us that have been fighting it for years. They just need to know what's going to happen when this legislation passes,"" said Mr. Alford, a lawyer who has been trying to legalize pot in the state for 11 years in court and in advocacy organizations like Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. ""They have the potential to take our lives in their hands with it. The public opinion has shifted, and I think that now the time is right for it to come to fruition.""

Some Colorado marijuana users say it's the federal government, not the law enforcement authorities, that has been overly aggressive in busting recreational users.

""What a lot of people are wondering is why the federal government is taking so much time to implement this,"" said Jason Allen, a 34-year-old Denver resident who recently began smoking pot in private and had used cannabis in the state since he was 18 and has a medical condition that he described as chronic back pain. Before he began using, he was a regular customer at the marijuana store run by Mr. Allen's father, who started the chain.

Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level at the same level it was when Mr. Obama took office in January 2009. That means that marijuana users in the black market are more likely to be arrested or prosecuted for possession than are people who work or are in a regulated business. But in a state like Colorado with a legal medical marijuana market that has grown exponentially in the past three years, there are also likely far more users whose businesses will be punished by the authorities than there can be who will be profiting from it, Mr. Allen said.

""This whole policy of going after those who are trying to open small businesses or work as small operators at all is taking out of business many growers, distributors and retailers who really have nothing to do with the pot trade except for sharing their genetics,"" Mr. Allen said. ""We have made the federal government's job difficult.""

At the same time, even legalization advocates acknowledge that it was tough to convince the Obama administration that this was the right strategy for the administration to advocate for this year after 2010, when, some in Congress and in law enforcement said, a strong federal posture on marijuana was needed. Some, like Mr. Alford, said there was a broader sense of disillusionment with the Obama administration after the 2008 election."

"The Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin has a great column about Hillary's campaign strategy, and it's worth reading, but she misses the obvious point about the GOP. In a nutshell:

Republicans are using Clinton as an opponent in their quest for a majority in 2020, and that's the point. They don't need her supporters. They can be the party of old Democrats and the party of young Republicans, and they'll have a good time doing it. They just need to keep her in the spotlight.

I haven't seen much evidence of Republicans using Clinton as an opponent in 2020. (In fact, a few reports suggest that Republican voters have abandoned ""Trump for President"" in favor of ""Hillary for President"".) But it's worth noting, even if it's only anecdotal. Republicans have had success doing what they do best — using the power of incumbency to win in a presidential election year.

Democrats have a good shot at winning elections in 2020, but they'll almost certainly need to fight for every single state. The way they do that is with a candidate who is disliked by a majority of the country. And that's exactly what happened in 1994 and 2000, when the Republicans were the incumbents in both cases. There were good arguments against Bob Dole during that decade, but the media coverage of Dole compared to that of Hillary's 2000 run was pretty similar. Republicans got the presidency in those years because they won over the voters.

It will be the same story in 2020. The party that prevails in the presidential election has an obvious advantage — a lot of the voters that the Democratic nominee is supposedly running against will be home, not in a swing state. (And the Democrats have to be concerned about the party's future in some of those states.) Clinton has no obvious challengers for the nomination. The Democratic base may not have come over to the Democratic nominee in 2017, but they're not going to desert her in 2020.

Republicans have a great chance to win elections by going toe to toe with Democrats with Trump as their standard-bearer. Clinton is an extremely unpopular candidate — as Rubin admits — but her image as a Democratic incumbent isn't nearly as negative as Trump's image is. While Trump has a lot of support, he can't carry states like Michigan or Wisconsin.

The Republican Party will almost certainly come out victorious in 2020, if only because the Democrats will have an unpopular candidate. But Republicans will go out of their way to keep their nominees from being hated."

"Cincinnati Bengals punter Kevin Huber was one heck of a rookie special teams player for the Cincinnati Bengals in 2016. There are many things to celebrate in a player's first year (or first contract for the Bengals) but the fact that Huber was able to be on field for the majority of Cincinnati's special teams game with a concussion for the entire season is truly remarkable. In what was also just a remarkable season for the Bengals kicking game Kevin Huber was able to record two consecutive touchback returns, and he does them with accuracy and ease. He does them like he's not even taking them.

The latest from SportsLine Week 5 NFL Picks

Huber, who's a fourth-year pro, is a very talented return man and punter. The punter field goal percentage among kickers in the NFL this year was 76.5 for the season, but that's good enough to be No. 2 in the league overall. His touchback rate of 14.6 percent, just behind New England Patriots' placekicker Stephen Gostkowski, was good enough for fourth best. There are a few things Huber excels in, but what he is known for a lot is punt return. He's also a really good punter, which makes him the most valuable of Cincinnati's offensive and defensive linemen this season when it comes to special teams. That gives him the highest value among the Bengals' offensive and defensive players.

Huber has also made a couple of highlight reel blocks on special teams, showing that he's a special player with special instincts. The Bengals have an outstanding punting and kicking game, but Huber, a converted kicker, has made them even better through his work on special teams."
"John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Facebook and email. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) In a new interview with The Guardian, former Vice President Al Gore says he and his wife, Tipper, won't use fossil fuels in the future.

Gore said his decision is based on his belief that fossil fuels are, right now, a ""bridge fuel"" that will allow humanity to meet its ""fair share"" of the planet's energy needs.

""I am not on a crusade to stop people using fossil fuels,"" Gore told the Guardian. ""I am not on a crusade to stop people going to the moon. I am on a crusade to stop the rise of the oceans. And it's clear to me that as the oceans rise, as the seas become more acidic, as the temperatures rise, there is not going to be an alternative.""

But Gore, who became a climate change activist in the 1970s, says he's not going to go around telling people to stop using fossil fuels. ""There's no silver bullet to this crisis,"" he told The Guardian.

The former vice president's comments come as he prepares to release the results of a ""deeply disturbing"" climate survey he commissioned in early 2016, the first of its kind. The survey is expected to show that Americans overall are far more concerned about the issue than they were in the past.

In response to the survey, Gore and his partner, actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio, launched a campaign to raise public awareness about climate change. Gore says the campaign, called ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,"" will be released in June and will feature footage from his documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" his other documentary, ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,"" which focuses on climate change.

Gore's announcement on Tuesday comes a day after President Donald Trump rolled back Obama-era regulations meant to combat climate change. Trump's decision to rescind the climate rules extended to more than 900 coal-fired power plants and helped boost coal stocks.

Gore has come under criticism from some quarters for his public support of the President. Some critics have suggested the former vice president has become a hollow symbol of the environmental movement, and are calling for Gore to give up his environmental activism to focus on his political career. He has said he's not changing his political views.

""I'm very concerned that the moral authority of the environmental movement is being debased by the very people who are supposed to be leading the movement,"" Gore told The Guardian.

"I'm not really sure what to say about this book. It is, however, the first book I've read by Lawrence Block. I read Block's books as a teenager and read a lot of his books as an adult. He is a brilliant writer both in terms of his writing and in understanding the problems that people face in their professional life. He is a light-hearted, humorous guy but his books are not light-hearted and his books are serious.


I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of block's writing style. He has a funny writing style but it is very dry. This book, however, is in a different league. I'm not sure where Block is coming from but this book is very well written. It is funny, it is touching, it is thought provoking, it is touching, it is funny, it is touching, it is thought provoking, it is funny, it is touching, it is funny, it is touching and it is funny.


Let me give you a little background. I'm a professor. I'm not a professor for the love of teaching, but I really enjoy writing. I enjoy teaching and I enjoy reading, but I don't enjoy teaching as much as I enjoy writing. Right now I am in the middle of a book called ""The Master's Hand."" I am constantly writing and not even at that class where I am teaching. I am writing a book called ""The Master's Hand"" that I am working on right now. I am also a father. Right now my children are in the middle of their first year of high school. I'm a father and a teacher. I have two children. I work in two different professions. I am a professor and a father. It's a lot of work. It's a very full life. I'm lucky to have the job I have. I don't want to leave. I love my children. I don't want them to be without me.


That's why this book is such a joy. It is a wonderful book about life and about parenting. It is a book about a man who is trying to be a good father and a good husband. He cannot be. Neither can I. This book is about trying to change both our lives. It's about how we have a responsibility to change our lives and change our families. It's about how we are able to change our lives and have a better life together. It is a book about a man who is struggling with being a good father and a good husband. It is about a man who is struggling with a lot of things and beginning to understand a lot of things.

"The story of the US's war in Afghanistan is full of stories of men and women who have done heroic or noble things for their country. As you may know, when we went to Afghanistan back in 2010, the country was run by the Taliban. We've fought there and won, yet many Afghans continue to do the difficult work of rebuilding their country. Today, some 12 years after we entered Afghanistan, we still have a chance to end the war. Today, we invite you to meet six individuals whose personal stories will inspire you to make a difference in the Afghan future.

In this short video, American actor Matt Damon and comedian Seth Rogen speak about the story of a young boy, the Taliban, and what can be done about him. Damon, along with the team from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), created a documentary to share the real story of this young boy. The documentary is called The Unknown Child: The Young Taliban's Story. It will be shown in theaters beginning April 3, 2015.

The team at United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is committed to helping countries meet their development goals through action on development issues; empowering them with the tools to implement their sustainable development vision; and supporting their efforts to implement their development strategies.

Watch the short film produced by Matt Damon and Seth Rogen, and read the description (with video clips) to know more about these talented actors that helped in the production.

About Matt Damon

This film is currently in post-production.

In the film:

Matt Damon was born in Connecticut, and when he saw the Afghan film, he fell in love with Afghanistan. This film combines his passion for Afghanistan with his passion to inspire others, and he has taken on the responsibility of creating a documentary about a young boy who has gone from being a fan of The American President in the USA when Matt went to see him in 2011 to being a Taliban fighter on the ground in 2013. While in war, he learned about a girl he used to know, the future daughter of his friend. That night, he made her promise to take him with her to Afghanistan. On the night of the journey, the boy said goodbye to his mother and friends. He never heard her voice again.

It is difficult for a filmmaker to know how to describe the feeling a person has when he or she sees a child as he or she is, for that child has no concept of the film industry, no concept of money, and most importantly: no concept of the future. And this is why the film takes on the story of a 12-year-old who is driven by the promise of a future, but it is also the story of how Matt learned how to take on this responsibility.

About Seth Rogen

Since his debut in 2006, Seth Rogen has been an actor, writer, producer, director, and director of music videos (such as ""Super"

In a new interview, Donald Trump says he's not ready to run for president.

In an interview with 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl, Trump says he's still open to running for president, but only if he's able to raise the money.

""I'm not running, but I'm not ruling it out,"" Trump told Stahl. ""If I were to run, I want to run as a Republican. I don't want to run as a Democrat, I'll tell you that right now. I think the Republicans have a chance to do something very special, and I want to be a part of it.""

Stahl also asked Trump if he's open to changing his position on immigration.

""Well, I'm open to anything,"" Trump said. ""I'm not open to anything. I'm pro-life. I'm pro-Second Amendment. I'm open to anything that helps make our country great again.""

Trump also told Stahl that he doesn't want to be president, but if he were to run, he would run as a Republican.

""I don't think I'm qualified to be president. I don't think I've done anything in my life to make me qualified to be president,"" he said. ""I mean, I like to think I'm very smart. I think I'm very good at this stuff. I think I understand what's going on. I think I understand the world and I understand people. But I don't think I have the temperament, the look, the strength of character, the tremendous feelings, the hatred, the desire for vengeance, the desire for oppression that you need to have to be successful as a president. And I don't think I have the experience or the knowledge to be president.""

""You know, I've been very supportive of you and your show,"" Stahl said.

""Well, I've been very supportive of you, Lesley. You've been very supportive of me. I've also been very, very critical of you and your show. I never really liked you and your show. I didn't like your sound,"" Trump said.

""But now, I can't help it if you're a smart guy or whatever,"" Stahl said.

""You know, I do like your sound. But you're always controversial,"" Trump said.

"The talent pool of the recently-formed new league is enormous and the league is already in first place.

On Tuesday, an invitation to join the North American League Championship Series was extended to teams from the Atlantic Coast and Southeast — the teams that made up the original Challenger circuit.

The league, which will be called the Challenger Series, will enter the regular season with two spots available. To qualify, a team must qualify by finishing in the top half of the 10-team league's regular season, and it must then make the postseason. The team with the most points at the end of the regular season will be crowned the champion.

A team going into the regular season with fewer points than the champion will be relegated to the league's oceanic division, which will also be known as the Challenger Series Oceanic. The other team in that division will then qualify for the playoffs.

The league will be split into two divisions, Atlantic Division and Southeast Division, and the two divisions will play each other once every three weeks. The top two teams from each division will advance to the playoffs, which will be played on the regional circuit. The team with the most points at the end of the regular season will be crowned the champion.

The league will start with eight teams, and the first four can be found below:

CLG

memphisd

CompLexity Gaming

Team Coast

Team Solomid

Team Dignitas

Team Dragon Knights

The league's announcement was made on the same day that Riot Games was launching its own esports league, League Championship Series (LCS). The LCS is a $1.5 billion prize pool league, and it will include 24 teams competing in a regular season and playoffs. The championship game will be played on New Year's Eve, and the winner will take home a $1 million prize pool.

The North American Challenger Series will begin in the fall, with the top two teams from each division entering the playoffs to qualify for the league."

The state doesn't have the right to tax your property or income.

There are at least 10 reasons why it is illegal to take your property by force.

The state doesn't have the right to seize your property unless you are convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.

You have no property rights unless you live in a community with specific rules and regulations for who may own what and how property may be used.

The owner of the gun has no legal right to do whatever he wishes with the gun unless he is a licensed professional security.

The gun owner has no legal right to do whatever he wishes with the gun unless the gun is registered and requires a license in order to be used.

State law prohibits the government from taking your property to use for other purposes, unless the government can prove to the court that the transfer will not be used in a criminal activity while in your possession and that the property will be retained as property.

State law prohibits the government from taking your property in order to make money.

The only reason the government can seize your property is if it wants to make a show case that it can make a case that someone else who does not have a specific right to possess that object is stealing it.

How is it legal to own a gun without a FFL and under how many circumstances? Here are some facts that state gun owners often don't know.

You CAN own a gun with no background check.

It is legal to have a gun if you are a member of the US military, federal law enforcement agents, the National Guard, a member of or an attendee at a state, county, municipal, or local law enforcement or military organization, or a member of the US Coast Guard or Coast Guard Reserve. If you belong to one of those organizations and buy a gun from a federal firearms licensed dealer (FFL), then you will only need a background check to get the purchase or possession in your name. The gun would be transferred to the person you bought it from via a FFL. You can only be the possessor of a handgun, shotgun or rifle in the state if you are also a member of the Alaska National Guard. You can also be a member of the National Guard outside of Alaska if you purchased it from the federal government.

It is illegal to own a gun for the purpose of selling it.

Anyone who would like to sell a handgun, a shotgun or rifle, or a high capacity magazine to someone that does not have a Federal Firearms License (FFL) is required to fill out an ATF Form 4473 which asks for a name, address and date of birth, a name"
"I thought it was nice to go back and look at the three post-World War II titles that had the most successful online gaming communities: The World Wide Web, AOL Instant Messenger and MySpace. I've been really researching and thinking about what makes a successful online community for a while now so I thought I'd do a post on this.

When I went back and looked at the games that had the most success online I noticed that there were a few things in common. They were all multiplayer games with a story that was completely real. The games were all single-player games that allowed players to have their own world but still interact with the other players online. The games all had a strong community that was able to create a lot of positive feedback and fear of death. And they all had a really strong community that gave a lot of people an experience that they had never experienced before.

My personal favorite is probably the World Wide Web. It was a simple, fun game with a lot of social aspects. It had a huge community of over 100,000 people that was very active. All of the new players were automatically born into the community and had to figure out what was going on. The community created a language that they all used. And then it just got better and better as it was played. It was a very positive community and people just wanted to be a part of it.

Another game that had a really strong community was AOL Instant Messenger. It was a chatroom that had a lot of social aspects. People were able to communicate with each other and have real conversations with their friends. It really had a very strong community that was very active. It was so active that a lot of people started spamming chatrooms. So the administrators were able to shut off chatrooms and just have one chatroom that was mostly about the game. It was a very nice community and they just kept growing and growing and growing.

My personal favorite is probably my favorite game of all time, MySpace. MySpace was a very simple game that had social aspects but all of the players were in the same room. It was very very simple and it was really just a simple game. But if you look at the type of games that were successful online, they were all games that had a strong community. And they were all games that allowed a player to feel like they were a part of a really large community.

"LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Lakers are set to introduce a new set of uniforms Saturday night.

The new look will be worn for a game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday at the Staples Center.

""We've been working on the new gameday uniforms for the past few weeks,"" Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said in a news release. ""We're excited to introduce them to the fans and hope they will enjoy them.""

The team's previous uniforms were also designed by Nike, which also created the Lakers' current uniforms. The new uniforms, which will include the new alternate logo, will be released during pregame warm-ups Saturday night.

The team's new uniforms will be worn from Saturday night through the Oct. 1 game against Minnesota.

The new uniforms will be made by Nike and will be worn primarily during warm-ups. New uniforms will be released during warm-ups.

""We worked closely with Nike on the design, and we believe the new uniforms will be an important part of our team's look this season,"" Kupchak said. ""We look forward to unveiling them to the fans and bringing the new look to life during the preseason.""

The team's current color scheme is black, gold and white.

The new uniforms will be available for purchase at all Staples Center ticket locations, as well as online at lakers.com.

The uniforms have been described by Kupchak as ""a bit edgier"" than the current ones.

""We wanted to update our look,"" he said. ""The key is to look at the history of the Lakers, and how we've been a unique franchise for several decades. We wanted to take a fresh look with our uniforms and give them a modern feel."""
"A major update to the Chrome Web Store in May could signal the end of third-party Chrome extensions that allow users to easily share the Web with others.

The update could also affect extensions for popular video games, which often include user-generated content. In particular, the Chrome Web Store's update policy is based on ""content,"" which may mean some kinds of content, such as YouTube videos, are blocked on Web sites in an update while some kinds of content, such as Web-hosted games, can be shared freely.

Chrome will use ""authorization"" if it determines an extension doesn't follow its policies. An extension could be blocked because the author doesn't give the extension ""permission"" to share content with others, or because it violates the terms of use for the Web site or extension it is hosting.

Google is introducing a new policy that does not distinguish between third-party extension and Web site content. Instead, it says extensions and Web site creators do not need permission to share content they develop ""within the web-platform."" The changes are based on the new policy to avoid developers from having to provide content to websites they create or update themselves in the meantime, or from having to constantly update their websites to keep up with security updates.

Google has long discouraged developers from developing extensions, because they could violate its terms of the Web or use its servers to host sites that make content available. While Google is gradually improving the permissions it gives extensions, it's leaving some types of content out of the mix. That will make it easier for Chrome users to share content.

Developers already used to getting their content through a third-party Web site or application will continue to do so. In March, for example, Google made the Web store ""a bit more curated"" by requiring developers to give other developers ""permission"" to use their sites. The change to the policy on content was announced in a post to the Google developer-submitted mailing list on Thursday.

Google ""currently uses authorization based on content, but it's not clear that content alone is sufficient,"" said Joe Lieberman, director for product management at Google. It could be that Google will give content authorization if it's necessary, he added, ""or if it's technically or financially impossible to do so.""

If users want to share a video, for example, they'll have to add an ""x-icon"" to the end of the URL — such as ""youtube.com/channel/UO-gB4HtQi3dvXjzCJpj2Bc"" — or add an ""x-sharing-url"" to the end of the upload URL to let Chrome know where to find the content.

The new policies are probably what a lot of Web developers have been looking for. But the changes could come with more than a minor drawback — if Google and Web site administrators"

New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has had a rough go of it since being traded to the Giants in March. He was suspended for four games without pay for violating the league's PED policy, then he missed the final three games of the regular season for violating the league's substance-abuse policy.

Those missed games caused Manning to fall from his usual spot on the fantasy football leaderboard, which was a No. 1 quarterback at PFF, to No. 15 at the time of the suspensions. He has since bounced all the way back up to No. 7.

He's at No. 8 in PFF's latest edition of the rankings. That's despite missing two games and throwing a record-tying seven interceptions while completing just 64 percent of his passes.

It's been a hot run for Manning in the rankings, and it may continue."

The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday dropped its investigation into the sale of the Canadian company Uranium One, claiming the sale was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

The department's statement on the decision, which was first reported by The Hill, said the investigation had uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing.

""The Department of Justice does not make public comments about ongoing investigations,"" it said.

The move came after The Hill reported that the company's chairman Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech in Moscow in 2010, just before the Russian government approved the sale of a company that controlled 20 percent of U.S. uranium.

The FBI and the Department of Justice had been investigating whether donors to the Clinton Foundation received special favors while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.

The Hill reported that during the same time period, the FBI was conducting an investigation into a Russian bribery scheme.

The FBI had also opened a separate investigation into the sale of Uranium One to the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom in 2010.

""In all of our investigations, we have found no evidence that Hillary Clinton ever took action as secretary of state with respect to the approval of the sale of Uranium One or with respect to the Russian purchase of Uranium One,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

""Although we have not determined a reason to move forward with our recommendation to the Attorney General that the investigation be closed, we have made clear that we intend to conduct this investigation thoroughly and openly, and will take appropriate action based on the results.""

Uranium One, which owned 20 percent of the U.S. uranium supply, was sold to Rosatom in a controversial deal.

The FBI has seized records from the firm involved in the deal, the FBI's New York office said in a statement.

But the sale of Uranium One, which was approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), was a major campaign issue for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

The FBI's investigation into the sale of Uranium One was kept under wraps for more than a year, until it was revealed that Hillary Clinton had used her own email server to conduct official business while secretary of state.

A separate investigation by the State Department's inspector general also revealed that Clinton had used a personal email account to conduct official business.

During the FBI's investigation, the agency found that the Clinton Foundation had accepted millions in donations from people associated with the Uranium One deal.

The DOJ said that the FBI had used the law and facts of the case to determine that the flight of the investors' funds was not meant to benefit the company, but rather to benefit the Clinton Foundation.

If there's one thing the Colorado Avalanche organization has embraced this season, it's the fact that they are in the business of winning. Colorado has played in two of the most competitive and entertaining hockey environments in the NHL this season, defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins and the New Jersey Devils on the road and then defeating the New York Rangers and the Ottawa Senators in a home and home series.


This week Colorado faces the St. Louis Blues for the second time in two weeks. The Avalanche have had a number of key players out injured, including Ryan O'Reilly, Nathan MacKinnon, and Tyson Barrie. There's only so much a team can do to avoid getting swept by a team they're supposed to beat. As for the Blues, they're off to a good start with 10 points in their first ten games.


The Avalanche have won eight of their last ten games against St. Louis, but the Blues are riding a five game winning streak. They've won three of the last four games in Colorado.


The Blues have been playing some good hockey of late. They've only lost two games in regulation since the All-Star Break, and they've lost only two of their last ten games. They've brought that winning streak to a close tonight, losing to the Blackhawks in Chicago.


In the past five games, the Blues have outscored their opponents 18-11. They're not afraid to play a physical game, and that's reflected in their penalty kill at 86.8%. That's a good number, and it's good to see a team with a penalty kill that's not afraid to kill penalties.


The Blues haven't scored a goal in their last three games, but they're still averaging 1.85 goals per game. That's good for second in the NHL. The Blues are in a great spot and should be able to get some momentum moving forward.


Colorado wins the game 4-2."
"For the past 13 years, the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has been pushing to force religious-school officials to disclose whether their colleges have religiously motivated exemptions for discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

But now the Obama administration has shifted its focus — now it's a legal fight over whether a certain religious college must pay a religious group a settlement after filing a discrimination lawsuit against them. At issue are so-called ""accommodation agreements,"" which require religious organizations to allow students to use their facilities ""in a way that does not conflict with the sincerely-held religious beliefs of the organization.""

So where does one get a legally permissible accommodation agreement?

And what happens if a government agency decides the student's religious objection is sincere—that's what the government decided in this case?

This case, filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, asks and answers the above questions.

Last spring, Trinity Lutheran College (CLC) sued its accreditor, the Commission on Accreditation for Educational Programs in Higher Learning, accusing the accreditor of discrimination after failing to extend an accommodation agreement that CLC demanded.

That accreditor refused: the accreditor said, ""No religious student group will be accommodated under our accreditation plan at CLC…If students are accommodated for accommodation, it has to have nothing to do with religious values…We don't have a right to impose a viewpoint or a religious viewpoint on students."" In short, the accreditor said, Trinity was not entitled to the kind of accommodation that Trinity wanted, as it was a religious school and not for religious groups like other student groups.

The administration, for its part, declined to intervene in this case.

In May 2016, a federal district court judge in Chicago ruled in favor of CLC's claim: ""Although Trinity Lutheran College may be an association of churches, it is, as the Court states, 'a religious institution that has an official mission to provide education to students who are adherents and followers of the Lutheran Church, without regard to their religious beliefs.'""

The accreditor appealed: the appeal ""focuses on whether the religious-student accommodation at issue is a violation of Title IX because it singles out religious groups for accommodation at colleges across the country."" The case eventually worked its way to U.S. Supreme Court.

Today, on behalf of CLC and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, the ACLU filed a motion to intervene.

The case was heard by the Supreme Court late last month. (It is expected to be decided in July, with the Supreme Court's consideration of Trinity Lutheran College)

A similar case, First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles v. Aglietta, will also be heard in the Supreme Court at the end of April, but that case was more"
"The following article appears in the Aug. 29 issue of ESPN The Magazine.

Hollywood has long been a place where an un-self aware filmmaker can make a $1 million movie and a $100 million movie. In the new millennium, the numbers have increased dramatically. In 1996, when the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences began making nominations, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would only nominate nine movies for best picture (the rest would have to be nominated for ""best director"" or ""best adapted screenplay""). Last year, the Academy decided to reduce that number to seven, with ""Selma"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" as the two nominees. In 2015, six movies will be nominated for best picture.

In this year's best picture race, ""Selma"" will be followed by ""American Sniper"" and ""Furious 7."" The awards are considered so crucial it has been a hot topic during an American election year. In the days before the Oscars, the debate went from the merits of each film as ""good movies"" to, as Donald Trump famously phrased, the question of whether a Muslim should be allowed to serve as president. In the weeks following the Oscars — particularly in the final three weeks leading up to the event — talk has centered around whether or not Hollywood is embracing progressive politics, which is not entirely unlike the debates among the American public at large, or the debate over gay marriage. When news broke last week that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band had broken a boycott, many fans on Twitter and Facebook took to calling the ""music industry"" ""liberal.""

But a larger question still looms: are films of the contemporary period — in which ""Selma"" appears to be the most radical movie — getting better at representing a broader range of humanity?

Some films may be doing it with increased frequency. ""Selma"" is one of many recent films to challenge the mainstreaming of the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. Others are doing it more consistently. ""Inherent Vice"" is a movie about a young, disenchanted drug trafficker who finds a secluded spot and falls deeply in love with a woman he meets at a party. It has been described among fans as the first film for which Tarantino is a fan. ""Fury,"" directed by Brian Helgeland, was a movie about a man who comes back to a small town after his wife's death to find life is as it once was, the way it was, even if he doesn't really believe he deserves it.

It is hard to say which of these films, other than ""Selma,"" would make the Academy Awards list if ""Selma"" never existed. Most filmmakers are too busy with their own work to try to fit every movie into any particular box or mold. ""Furious 7,"" the latest ""magnum opus,"" a movie that manages to be thrilling, funny and"
"I was in the ER last week for a bad headache. The ER doc said that the headache had been going on for several weeks, and that I needed to get a magnetic resonance imaging study for headaches with an unknown ""trigger"". I asked how that worked, and she said the MRI can make the headache into pain. I asked what that meant, and she said it meant that the MRI could tell me which part in my brain was causing the headache, and then I could start treatment there, without a second appointment.


My husband asked, ""So what if you're going to show me a picture of my brain?"" I said, ""No! What if I'm not?"" He said, ""I'm not telling you that, but I don't trust your ability to interpret these graphs of MRI pictures unless you're being shown a real MRI, not a flat one like this."" My husband has a good mind, so he said, ""I'll bet $5 that there are areas in your brain and spinal cord that aren't visible in these pictures."" I was a little offended, but not a bit concerned, because I knew I was in a good place to look.


The MRI scan was done by my husband. She asked me, as I lay on a bed looking at the picture on the monitor, to imagine a line connecting each of the white points on the MRI. Then she asked me to imagine a line connecting each point to one another, one-point-one-point. She asked me if there were any dots on the lines and where their heads would meet on the lines, where the lines started and ended. She asked me, again as I lay on a bed looking at the picture on the monitor, to imagine a line connecting each point to one another. And she asked me for my visual thought about these lines and dots. Again I said, NO! She said, ""I think you're thinking what I want you to think.""


I'm not a psychologist, or a clinical neurologist, or anything like that. I just know something about MRI scans and their usefulness in pain perception. I've heard of MRIs being used as a tool in pain management for ""cancer"" as well. I've heard of MRIs being used to look at a tumor, and finding other places in the body. No one ever tells me what this picture means. I just look at it.


But I don't think they're supposed to.


The pain management expert I consulted for my headache said, ""You need to be really, really careful with MRI testing"" and that she had seen patients have ""severe"" side effects, but would not talk specifics about specifics.


I asked, ""So how can I know if my experience is'severe', or minor, or benign?"" The expert said, ""You just can't.""

"On Thursday, the National Institutes of Health announced a new partnership with Microsoft to develop a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) that could help doctors diagnose and treat diseases in more effective and efficient ways.

The new program, known as Microsoft Watson Health, is the first of its kind to be created by a private company for a single, public-private initiative. The NIH will contribute $100 million to the program and Microsoft will contribute $100 million.

The new program will use machine learning to help doctors make more informed decisions about treatment and diagnosis. It will also bring Microsoft's massive research and development capabilities to bear in the search for new ways to identify and treat illness. This is the culmination of a collaboration between the NIH and Harvard, which led to the development of the Watson medical system.

""This partnership will help create an entirely new way for doctors to interact,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH, said in a statement. ""Machine learning has the potential to transform how we diagnose and treat disease and could serve as the foundation for training the next generation of medical scientists.""

The partnership will use machine learning to help doctors make more informed decisions about treatment and diagnosis. It will also bring Microsoft's massive research and development capabilities to bear in the search for new ways to identify and treat illness.

Microsoft's Watson supercomputer is designed to ""think"" like a human doctor, and has a number of medical applications. In 2013, it was used to assist doctors at the Cleveland Clinic in saving the life of a 7-year-old boy with leukemia. In 2015, the computer helped doctors diagnose and treat a woman with a brain tumor, which had spread to her spine.

The new program will use machine learning to help doctors make more informed decisions about treatment and diagnosis.

At the time, Microsoft said that the new machine learning program could help doctors make diagnoses and make diagnoses in a fraction of the time it takes a human doctor to make the same diagnosis.

The new project will allow the NIH to ""convene a research team to build the platform that will enable a new generation of machine learning and medical research to further advance the ability of medical researchers to provide patients with more accurate, personalized information,"" NIH director Francis Collins said in a statement. ""Today's announcement is a critical step in bringing AI to the clinic.""

The partnership between the NIH and Harvard will focus on identifying new ways to identify and treat illnesses.

""As the world's foremost expert on cancer, we are excited to partner with the NIH to advance the search for new ways to diagnose, treat, and ultimately prevent cancer,"" said Harvard Medical School Dean Dr. Michael G. Fox in a statement. ""We are hopeful that this new partnership will lead to a new generation of future cancer cures.""

"PASADENA, Calif. - Scientists have identified a new, novel family of proteins that function as regulators of calcium signaling and are a potential target for development of new therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's, according to new research from the NASA Astrophysics Institute and University of California, Berkeley.

This new group of proteins may serve as one reason for a decline in production of a neurotransmitter in the brains of ALS patients - a potential link that could have potential therapeutic efficacy in treating the disease.

""This protein group and others like it may be important regulators of calcium signaling in an array of different cells, not just the neurons,'' said Dr. John Donoghue, the lead author on the research paper and researcher in Dr. Patrick J. O'Malley's lab at Astrophysics at UC Berkeley. ""It makes for a fascinating time in science as we learn more about how this important metabolic process works. It's an interesting time to be a scientist.""

Named CaMKIIalpha, or calmodulin kinase 2alpha, this protein is a member of a family of proteins called N-type ATP-dependent protein kinases that are found in both cells and the nucleus of all organisms. This family comprises more than 40 proteins which are related in some way.

""They are responsible for many cellular processes and the majority of their function comes as part of a coordinated complex in the cell nucleus that's also responsible for the regulation of calcium signaling,'' said Dr. John Donoghue. ""Calcium plays a critical role in many important cellular and biochemical processes during the early stages of development. In the early stages of human life, calcium is also essential for the normal function of almost every cell in the body. In addition to regulating calcium signaling, these proteins regulate other aspects of our bodies and the environment through their functions as ion channels and/or transcription factors.""

This family has been the focus of intensive research in many different laboratories such as Dr. O'Malley's at Berkeley and the Carnegie Institute for Technology at Stanford University and the University of California, Irvine. However, until now, the exact structure of these proteins - the subunits which make them work - was unknown.

""The proteins they form are very different compared to other proteins in the N-type ATP-dependent protein kinase family that we find throughout the body. In other words, each subunit is unique,'' said Dr. Donoghue. ""This is an interesting step forward in our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the function of these proteins.""

The research was funded in part by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, under which NASA is advancing the frontiers of exploration to meet America's needs.

"As he campaigned in New Hampshire this week, Donald Trump sounded more like a Republican candidate than a candidate for the presidency.

""I'm not running for president, OK?"" Trump told an audience of thousands of supporters during a town hall in Concord on Thursday. ""I'm running for president. OK?""

It was a familiar line from Trump, who has never traveled the world or even tried to build a coalition of interest groups beyond his core base of white, conservative men. He's been running as a political outsider since he launched his campaign last year.

But now that he's in the midst of a tight presidential race, Trump is reshaping his campaign to reflect the realities of a presidential campaign.

The Republican Party, he says, is going to have to change in order to win in November.

""I'm not going to be the nominee,"" Trump said Wednesday night, responding to a question about whether his campaign is in trouble. ""But I'm going to be willing to share the delegates.""

Trump has also begun to reach out to voters and minorities with a message of inclusion and changed his rhetoric on immigration and policy.

""I'm going to be the president for all Americans,"" Trump said at a rally in Elko, Nev., on Wednesday night. ""I am not looking to do the job of a president. I am looking to do the job of a president to make America great again.""

Trump's campaign has been reshaping itself by moving away from the folk-hero persona that has defined him throughout his career. He's changed his speech style and his positions on some issues. He's also begun to reach out to minorities.

""I don't know who the hell he is,"" said Eric Sanders, 29, a Republican who works in the real estate industry and supported Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in the primary. ""I think he's a fascist. I think he's a buffoon.""

Sanders said he hasn't heard from Trump since Rubio dropped out, but he's had discussions with other Republicans.

""There's a whole community of people that are really scared of Trump,"" Sanders said. ""At this point, I think it's the only way.""

Trump has spent weeks on the campaign trail courting evangelicals and other conservative voters, who are key to his path to the GOP nomination.

He's also gotten more specific about what he would do as president, saying he would send troops back to the Middle East and build a wall along the Mexican border. He's turned to former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, a former Trump rival, as a co-chair, and he's begun to show more interest in running mate Mike Pence, who is a moderate Republican who was governor of Indiana.

""I'm not looking to get involved,"" Trump said Thursday on Fox News. ""I'm not looking to do the job of"
"FORT WORTH, Texas — An 18-year-old Texas girl is accused of helping her older sister cook and serve up to 100 meals a day to their parents, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.

The girl, who authorities said has been in the foster care system since she was a child, is accused of making the meals for the 31-year-old mother, who is also in custody.

The girl, who is being held without bond, is accused of trying to hide the food so her sister wouldn't get in trouble for serving it.

It's unclear how many meals the teen helped her sister prepare. Authorities said that the 16-year-old was more involved, but the younger sibling's role was still evident.

The mother told investigators that she and her daughter had been in foster care since she was a child. She said she stopped being able to go for two weeks but then returned to the facility.

The mother told investigators that her foster daughter was sick and her foster daughter was sick, so she ate a lot. She said she tried to hide the food so her daughter wouldn't get in trouble for serving it.

She told investigators that she and her daughter were taken to the same foster home in southwest Fort Worth.

The mother said she was sick and couldn't make it to a doctor, so her daughter took her to see a doctor and he diagnosed her with a kidney infection.

She said she told the doctor about the food and food was taken away from the house.

The girl told authorities she and her sister would eat all the food in the house, save for the ones that were for herself and her sister.

Authorities said they will ask a judge to send the teen to juvenile detention."

"The following story has been sent to us by a reader in Germany, who is now in Australia and is facing deportation on account of her sexual orientation:

In the last year, I have made some remarkable progress in Germany, and we can now write about these achievements. It has taken me nine years of living in a state of total confusion, which has cost me a great deal of time during my university years and my final year of university work. And now, I am at peace. I have been in Germany for almost six months on a long-term temporary residence permit, and I am now living in a hostel. I work as a waitress and live with an old man, the father of my partner.

I feel very happy, free, and at peace. I have the freedom to express myself as a gay person in ways that were impossible in a country like Germany before I applied for the visa. In fact, my partner is the first and only one in my life who I have been able to have a meaningful relationship with.

My partner has brought me a lot of joy and joy to the world; I don't think that is the purpose of sending me back to a place like this one. This is not about making Germany a better place; it is about me and I alone being sent away. I believe in the United Nations, I believe in its values; I don't believe that I am a danger to Germany. I am a person with a story, and I do have a right to say this story to people throughout the world. I never have had the chance to tell this story about my life and, if I didn't speak out about it, I probably never would have had a chance to tell others either…I do not regret what happens, but I would much rather tell my story because of the incredible support I already feel here. In any case, this is now what is most important to me: to tell my story.

My partner and I have many adventures and we have a wonderful time in Germany. We go out for dinner, I am able to work in the evening and go to the cinema every Saturday, and now that I have been granted a visa, I am able to get a temporary job and pay off some of the student loans that I still carry. I will tell you that the most important thing that I think I have gained as a result of all this is respect from my friends.

My partner and I went to the ""big three"" of cinema chains in Berlin. All three are within walking distance of each other. When I asked for help filling out my job application, the person handling the whole process was very helpful, and we were granted a job in the next day, with which to begin our journey. My partner and I were also able to meet a lot of friends in Germany, which brought us a very warm welcome. And when we arrived, we were allowed to go"

"The American government has, on its face, three legal bases for this action. First, it says that an Executive Order is not necessary because, in so far as it is not technically unconstitutional, the Executive Order can be executed without its signature – so it is not necessary for the President to take the Presidential Oath. Second, it says that the Executive Order is a ""mere presidential discretion"" and is not subject to review by any federal court. Finally, it says that if the President chooses to enforce the President's executive order and to refuse to take the Oath during his term of office, he has the ""right"" of refusal as a ""judicial officer,"" and thus that the Executive Order can be revoked.

The United States Supreme Court itself has not taken the issue either. On many occasions, Supreme Court Justices have taken the position that while executive actions that could be enacted by Presidential fiat are subject even to minor legal challenges – a point that was recently reaffirmed in the context of the Iran Nuclear Deal – there is no constitutional requirement that the Court grant injunctive relief in those cases. The Court's recent opinion, from the 2010 Citizens United case, did note that, ""It is certainly not the function of the courts, or the Government, to create or review presidential selections for high office,"" and this is exactly what President Obama is alleging here. And, in the same article, Justice Roberts, the second Justice on the Court, writes:

Executive actions taken by an President after assuming office, however, would almost always pose the constitutional question whether, once an issue is presented by a litigation, it would be up to the Court to decide whether such an action was the right course, or whether the President was merely exercising the ""discretion"" of his office to carry out his duties.

Justice Scalia, on the other hand, in a 2012 opinion wrote that, ""The Executive has the power to do this and, if the President thinks it a good idea, the question then arises 'whether he is required to tell Congress about it.'""

The Supreme Court, however, made a decision last spring when it issued a very narrow temporary stay – at the request of the Obama administration – after the Obama administration refused to allow a federal judge to issue a preliminary injunction against implementation of a provision of the president's health care plan. It was the first time a judge had ruled on the legality of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) and it is precisely this issue – whether courts should even be involved in the regulation of a provision of a law through a preliminary injunction – that has now led President Obama and his Justice Department to seek a stay of this lawsuit in federal court.

Of course, the administration claims that it takes this action after learning of two possible actions that Judge Richard M. Leon could rule on: the challenge to the constitutionality of the Obamacare provisions on which the stay was granted and the suit by the states to challenge the"
"After a long night of campaigning in Wisconsin, Donald Trump's campaign sent out robocalls to thousands of Wisconsin voters on Saturday, blasting their Democratic counterparts over the state's recent decision to pass a bill that limits the influence state judges can have on local gun stores.

""We got five more days of Trump. Bring it on,"" the Trump campaign robocall says. But the caller, who says he is Donald's brother Eric Trump, goes on to tell the recipient that Hillary Clinton is ""the most corrupt nominee ever,"" and ""you have no choice but vote to stop the corruption.""

""So in Wisconsin, we've put on hold this common sense gun bill that is a key component in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill,"" Eric Trump says. ""That was one of the key pieces of the Democratic agenda. Why are they so against it?""

When the caller asks the recipient if ""you know"" Hillary Clinton ""can't get anything done,"" Eric Trump notes that she ""made illegal agreements with Saudi Arabia,"" ""was a member of the TPP"" and is in favor of creating ""a national database to track everyone from ISIS to you.""

""The Democratic nominee supports a national database of Muslims to help keep safe Americans in this country from radical Islamic terrorists,"" Eric Trump said, before telling the voter that ""just wait until you discover that she's also in favor of closing down our southern border.""

The call has been widely described as a play on the Trump campaign message that ""all of our lives are in danger,"" after the candidate claimed Saturday night that ""thousands and thousands of lives"" are in danger.

After Trump's claims, his campaign's robocall began to use this language, while also citing a recent CBS News poll that showed that just 4 percent of Wisconsin voters are ""excited"" for the next president.

"The federal government has filed a lawsuit to stop a New Hampshire-based man from selling a T-shirt that depicts President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in front of a pile of cash.

Mark Lassiter of Keene, N.H., has said the shirts are a parody of the ""Clinton Cash"" book and movie that alleges that donors paid former President Clinton and his wife Hillary for access and favors during his time in office.

Now the U.S. Department of Justice is demanding that he stop selling the shirts, which he sells at his store and on his website.

In a complaint filed Thursday in New Hampshire federal court, Justice Department lawyers said the shirts are not protected speech under the First Amendment.

ADVERTISEMENT

""The shirts portray the Clintons as corrupt and guilty, and do so in a manner that is likely to cause a reasonable observer to conclude that the Clintons are corrupt,"" the complaint said.

""That is enough to satisfy the Government's showing of likely unlawful conduct.""

Lassiter, who has been selling the shirts since 2012, said the shirt is a satire on the book and movie.

He said he's received a flood of support from people across the country.

""The response has been overwhelming,"" he said.

""I'm only selling a couple of dozen, and I'm getting a lot of emails and phone calls from people saying, 'I got this shirt, it's my favorite. It's awesome.'""

The Clinton Cash book and movie allege that donors to the Clinton family's philanthropic foundation received favorable treatment from Clinton and his staff.

Lassiter said the shirts are aimed at poking fun at a concept that ""the Clintons are in such a deep hole that they couldn't possibly be corrupt. I'm working on two shirts right now, and I'm planning on doing a third one in the future.""

The Justice Department, in its complaint, said the shirts allegedly violate the Federal Election Campaign Act, and it seeks a court order to bar Lassiter from selling the shirts.

""The Government agrees that the statements on the shirts are sufficiently serious and inflammatory to subject the defendants to criminal liability for making them,"" the complaint says.

Lassiter said the shirts are intended to criticize the Clintons and their husband, former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonMr. President, tear down the wall hiding those FISA abuses Kavanaugh outrage exposes media bias — yet again Let's confirm Kavanaugh and move on MORE.

""I think it's an irreverent jab,"" he said.

"New details are emerging in the mysterious shooting death of Michael Brown, the unarmed African-American teenager who was shot and killed by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer last month.

On Tuesday, The New York Times published a lengthy report describing the alleged ""strong odor of marijuana"" in the Ferguson police station after Brown's shooting. The account of the alleged marijuana-bouquet dispute echoes several eyewitness accounts that have come to light since Brown was shot.

In addition, The Washington Post reported this month that a pair of witnesses told a lawyer for the Brown family that ""a store clerk had approached Brown and asked if he had any 'dollars' for cigarettes."" The ""dollars"" could have been something as simple as $20 or as valuable as $100.

The alleged encounter between Brown and the clerk is said to have occurred on the same store surveillance tape as Brown and the officer, Darren Wilson.

And last month, the St. Louis County prosecutor's office released body-camera footage of the shooting, in which Brown is repeatedly seen trying to surrender to the officer and the officer pointing his firearm at Brown in a threatening manner.

But it's important to note that even those details are not proof that what was described by authorities could be the shooting itself or that it took place. Still, these are all strong circumstantial signs, suggesting that something may have happened at the store that day. And the more investigators look into the matter, the clearer evidence of what happened at the Ferguson police station becomes.

Brown apparently had a history of drug possession, possibly linked to stolen goods he allegedly stole from a convenience store two or three weeks before the shooting.

According to The Post, a friend who lived with Brown in Ferguson told police that he was a ""chronic marijuana user,"" but refused to provide more details.

Authorities reportedly discovered small items of marijuana and pills inside Brown's hand and waistband when he was taken into custody. He also had a small baggie containing marijuana in his front pocket.

Police told the New York Times that the clerk at the convenience store told them Brown was ""acting like a complete fool"" when he asked for money. He said the clerk offered him $20, and the teen then told him he needed $100 for gas. Brown took out his car and fled in a car with his friend, the clerk told investigators.""

That's not the only suspicious detail that has come to light. Brown's close friend Dorian Johnson told police, ""If he had a problem with that store, he shouldn't be going into that store."" He added, ""Why would anybody go into that store?""

Authorities have also been investigating the alleged strong smell of marijuana in the police station. According to The Post, the report of a strong odor coming from the police station was ""based partly on the recollection of one cop, who told police there was a strong"
"In a world where humans will be replaced by robots and other machines by 2020, a New York startup called OpenDoor has been developing a door that can sense whether something is open or closed without ever unlocking itself.

""You can't open a door. It has to have some degree of autonomous behavior,"" said Oren Etzioni, the company's cofounder. The OpenDoor company has raised millions in seed funding through crowdsourcing, and this week announced that it had closed a $5.5 million round from Spark Capital and others. It plans to use the funding to hire a chief technology officer and expand its sales and operations teams.

It's easy to see the potential of this technology. By detecting an open door, the openDoor system could unlock itself or allow its owner to open it as well. An open door is an open door.

OpenDoor will debut in beta sometime this year. The company says it is ready to work with major manufacturers on building its product. For now, OpenDoor is available only in the United States and Canada, and it requires a $149 key fob — roughly about half the price of Tesla's Model S.

OpenDoor is one of the first major companies to bring open-ended technologies to consumer markets. A company called Meka sells a doorbell that locks or unlocks itself upon motion. OpenDoor differs in that it relies on technology from open-source software groups like the Linux Foundation and the Tor Project to determine when something is, and is not, an open door. OpenDoor's software, called OpenSense, relies heavily on software written by OpenDoor members.

[embedtweet id=""550148295589652752""]

The key fob technology that opens the openDoor could be applied to other consumer products. Smart locks don't just stop people from moving things around; they also stop people from using them. ""When you get a smart lock, you're basically locking out a lot of people who don't have the right to open the lock,"" Etzioni said.

OpenDoor plans to sell the door to major manufacturers, but Etzioni declined to estimate how much it would cost to produce a door that works like an OpenDoor door.

For now, OpenDoor's company goal isn't to create some cheap-o knock-off of an OpenDoor sensor. Instead, the company wants to introduce open-ended security into the mainstream.

"It is a time of great upheaval across the world. New political leaders are being elected. New systems are being built. And there are great questions about the value of those new systems. Will they really work?

There is no better person to provide a comprehensive history of the modern world than Charles Kindleberger. His most recent book, The Transformation of the Modern World, is a masterful history of the modern age. His writings have been published widely and he is widely read and quoted.

I think that many people who take a look at the world today have their own personal ideas about the nature of the world, its institutions and its future. I have found these to be often misguided. So, I asked Mr. Kindleberger to talk to me about these issues.

My interview with Mr. Kindleberger was conducted via email, using a Skype connection. It was a pleasant conversation. I greatly appreciate his willingness to speak with me on the record.

As a starting point for this conversation, Mr. Kindleberger shared some of the highlights of his latest book. Here is what he had to say about how the West's institutions fell apart around 1970, how Russia developed into a global power, and the problems facing the West in the 21st century.

Robert W. Merry is a journalist in Boston. In 2012, he was named the 2014 Pulitzer Prize winner for commentary, and his piece titled ""Putin's 'Great Game.'"" appeared in The Economist.

Mr. Kindleberger: The book begins with the events of 20 years ago this summer. What made you think that there was such a thing as a 'transformation'?

Mr. Merry: I was struck by how much there had been to transform in Europe and America only about a decade earlier in the 1990s than there had been in the previous century. And yet the transformation seemed so obvious to me: the rise of the internet, globalization, open economies, freedom of information, and the democratization and globalization of knowledge-information flows, and the globalization of markets–all were the result of what I called 'the long 1990s' and which the late economist Julian Simon was my chief student.

Mr. Kindleberger: Why didn't this transformation happen sooner?

Mr. Merry: I think it was mainly because we had been so busy conquering the rest of the planet that we hadn't had time to see that the rest of the world, as well as America, was actually a lot like us. It wasn't just that they were democracies–they had a free press and a very interesting, independent judiciary and a strong civil society. But they still went through their long, slow growth periods, and so we were still fighting to do the same battles as they had had, but with our forces more powerful and our battles longer. That made us overestimate our fighting power. So a revolution is a sudden change in attitudes, or a change in the"
"A 13-year-old girl's father has been arrested in connection with the rape and murder of her 27-year-old mother in the border area of North and South Waziristan.

According to Dawn.com, Ghulam Farooq was arrested on Tuesday evening by the FATA police's Special Cell. He was produced in a local court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody. He is currently being interrogated and a case has been registered against him.

A few days ago, a local tribal elder allegedly told the police that a man had been sent to the local community to look after the woman's children. When the elder questioned the man, he allegedly told him that he had been given the job because he was a relative of his.

The woman's body was recovered from the village of Shigri on April 10. It was found hanging from a tree in a secluded spot. Her husband, who was also a tribal elder, and his bodyguard were also arrested in connection with the crime.

In a recent interview, a senior local police officer said that the woman had been repeatedly raped and killed, and that the assailants were eight men and two women.

""The attackers have been fleeing the area,"" the officer said.

The local police station has been shifted to the tribal region of North Waziristan, and the murder case is being handled by the Waziristan North Waziristan police.

The Waziristan North Waziristan police brings technical and personnel support to the FATA police.

The Waziristan North Waziristan police is the only branch in the FATA which has been granted special powers by the government."
"As mentioned before, the latest changes to the rules of the World of Warcraft Arena Beta will be released in 2.4.6. We will be making some significant updates this weekend to the rules and the experience for all players interested in participating in the beta and taking this new stage of development. We strongly encourage all players, especially those that have a strong desire to play Arena, to get in a few games of Hearthstone while you are waiting for the changes to appear on the client.

Our biggest change is the removal of all gold limits for Arena battles and the ability to use gold for any other purpose outside of Arena. There will be no additional gold awarded as a reward for Arena battles whatsoever.

Gold remains a powerful currency, and should be used in the same manner in Arena matches. All players will retain the ability to use gold once they reach a stage of development where they earn enough to buy all the rewards they would like.

This change will result in many exciting changes for players who wish to participate in the Arena. We expect those who use gold more often to receive higher ranks and more powerful Arena rewards. All players will have the same opportunity to try out the Arena on a large scale. We have already seen a great deal of competition between the top performers in Arena and we hope the changes will spur even greater player participation in that exciting competition in 2.4.6.

Gold earned by players who use gold will remain usable within the game, and can be withdrawn on the same terms as any other currency in the system.

Our second change is to change how the Arena rewards are delivered in 2.4.6. If you have already completed all of the rewards in your queue, all rewards will be delivered to your mailbox as they are made available to you. This change does not affect your ability to earn rewards in the Arena. You simply continue as you normally would. In the event that you complete an Arena reward on Saturday 8/19/2012 (10:00 AM PST), these rewards will be delivered to your mailbox the next day.

As a result of the new gold rewards being delivered to your mailbox as you play, it is extremely important that you do not complete any unfinished rewards. If you are missing any Arena rewards (whether you completed them or not) the only way to complete them is to continue playing the Arena until you reach 100%, complete all your rewards, and then redeem them for the rewards you missed in the Arena queue.

A separate ""Residential"" reward pool from the rest of the rewards in the Arena will be available to players by default. All other rewards will be awarded to the players in the queue. This means that in order to start Arena, if you had a Gold-ranked Arena team and all of your players were Gold, you could begin Arena. If you did not have a Gold-ranked team, you could begin an Arena game regardless of your team's rating."

"That is one good first impression.

The first full-length trailer for ""Kingsman: The Secret Service,"" a film based on the spy-thriller that stars Colin Firth and Taron Egerton, premiered at the recent Toronto International Film Festival and, according to THR, it's already the best-received film trailer of the festival.

That's probably not the first time that's happened. And it's probably not the last.

""Kingsman"" is a comic book-style spy thriller, and the film carries a subtle tone: it's gritty, gritty, gritty. It's a spy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously or offer up any big reveals. It's more like an action movie that's set in a world where the guys have superpowers.

In other words, it's not the ""Hulk"" of spy movies, which is great. It's not a ""The Avengers,"" either, but it's not a ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" either.

It's a film that's fun, which is something you don't often find in the genre.

And that's what makes it special.

The trailer was directed by Matthew Vaughn, the director of ""Kick-Ass"" and ""X-Men: First Class,"" and it was produced by Jane Goldman, executive vice president of production at Twentieth Century Fox.

The film hits theaters Feb. 14, 2016.

"Grace VanderWaal, the 13-year-old singer-songwriter with an infectious voice, is changing the face of pop music. In addition to her signature song ""That's Me,"" she's released a second album, ""The Gifted,"" that has been a top 10 pop hit in the U.S., and Billboard magazine named her the youngest artist to ever earn a No. 1 album.

But just a few years ago, Grace VanderWaal was a very different child.

""I was a very withdrawn person, I was shy and not a lot of people liked me,"" VanderWaal told The Huffington Post on a recent day off from tour. ""I was so shy and quiet and I didn't really talk much. I was really shy and I could not really express myself. I never really had words for myself.""

VanderWaal said she was overly self-conscious around people and would often hide behind her mother's legs.

""I was very shy,"" she said. ""I wasn't a very outgoing person. I would just hide behind my mom's legs, like a little girl. And other kids would make fun of me and I would be like, 'Don't say that.' I just didn't like that.""

VanderWaal now says she was a ""kind of a misfit"" growing up. She didn't really fit in.

""I was a misfit,"" she said. ""I'm not really shy or anything like that. It's just something that I didn't really like.""

VanderWaal, who was born in New Zealand, was raised in the United States -- at first in North Carolina and then in Pennsylvania. She said she didn't really have many friends growing up, and didn't have anyone to talk to or talk to about that.

""I was really shy,"" she said. ""I would just hide behind my mom's legs, like a little girl. And other kids would make fun of me and I would be like, 'Don't say that.'""

She said she was shy and quiet, and didn't really talk much. Grace VanderWaal

""I didn't really have words for myself. I was very shy and I could not really express myself. I never really had words for myself.""

VanderWaal said she was high-maintenance as a child and was often forced to do things for people just because of how much they liked her music. In high school, she said she was forced to have a ""senior year"" where she went on a ""senior trip,"" and was given a bag to carry her things.

""I had to take a state trip to Japan,"" VanderWaal said. ""I had to do"
"A few years ago a former colleague and I put together a list of best-known American artists who were gay. As you might expect, there weren't any names to inspire outrage, except perhaps for those of the most outspoken. But some of the artists' works are now so obvious that it's hard to see what all the fuss is about.

For this list, we'll focus on the major artists and musicians who were publicly out (but not all of whom were gay), including artists from two of our own countries. It's important to acknowledge the pioneering work of other American musicians, which had a great impact on the coming-of-age and self-actualization of many homosexuals.

But it's interesting to see how artists from countries in America's backyard fared. Not only did those artists often come out, there's also evidence that they were well-received by the public. Here are five Americans who became well-regarded in Europe, and to whom many in America today can look back fondly:

1. George Harrison (born Jan. 4, 1947 in Dublin) George Harrison was an Irish songwriter, singer, violinist, and pianist; he is remembered for his distinctive, soulful voice and for the distinctive style in which he sang and played his instruments.

He was born in Dublin to a Welsh mother and a Scottish father; he was born into a musical family, a member of a musical family. The family's musical legacy was so dominant, it led him, as the son of a famous music promoter and the nephew of renowned pop singer Donny O'Malley, to play a wide range of music throughout his life.

When he was only 3 years old, Harrison's family moved to Liverpool, England when his father was appointed an English judge and he became involved in the British music scene. In 1964, he recorded with the popular folk group Wings, and three years later he was in the midst of one of the biggest musical collaborations of all time when he recorded ""Goodnight Sweetheart,"" the song he was writing with his now partner, Olivia Harrison. It went on to become one of his biggest hits and, perhaps, one of his most controversial. In 1967, he and O'Malley (who at the time was married to the British actress Olivia Poulet) recorded ""In My Life"" with producer and former Beatle George Martin, which earned Harrison the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 1969 and is regarded by many as his most personal song. As Harrison explained in an interview with CNN, ""The whole thing, the process of recording 'In My Life,' was a very difficult time for me. It was very dark, and I was very much a loner. I was the only child and I was the only one not interested in anything, except music and literature. So writing those lyrics, and playing those parts, it came out of the blue. When"

"I would never get tired of it.

That said, I also don't know that I would actually get excited about it. I was definitely intrigued when I watched the trailer.

That said, the first few frames of the trailer, which show a character talking about the beauty of the earth, immediately got me excited as well. I was looking at the picture on a book entitled ""The Great Red Dragon"" at some point while on a flight and thought perhaps it might explain something about the film... but what? I didn't find it in time to see it during the screening, but it seems like a good start.

It just seems to me like everything that is mentioned in that book, the dragons, and the other things are somehow tied into the story.

"The Navy has not yet paid its original $400 million contract to build the MV-22 Osprey, but the Defense Department's inspector general is taking that contract into account when it reviews the $1.2 billion contract for the aircraft.

The Associated Press reported in April that the department's inspector general ordered the Navy to treat the contract's price tag as a ""current contract"" when it reviews the aircraft.

The Osprey, also known as the tiltrotor, is a tilt-rotor aircraft with a vertical takeoff and landing capability. It can fly at up to speeds of 186 mph and land on a runway.

The Navy has been testing the aircraft in Hawaii and in California. The AP reports that the Navy is using the aircraft to train pilots and to run cargo missions. The aircraft is expected to be operational by the end of the year.

The MV-22, a tilt-rotor aircraft, was designed to be capable of landings on a carrier and take off and land during special operations. The aircraft, however, is not primarily used for warfighting missions. (Island Air/Associated Press)

The Navy's latest contract, for the Osprey, was to be paid through 2018. The Pentagon is currently in the process of revising that contract and expanding the number of MV-22s it is willing to pay. The Pentagon said in April that it expects the revised contract to be completed in the first quarter of 2017.

The report from the inspector general's office said in its report that the contract should have included a section that says the program is being audited and that the Navy must begin paying for the aircraft's development and testing.

The report said the contract's price tag was not factored into the new cost estimate.

The inspector general's office said it plans to send a letter to the Navy requesting the revised contract. The inspector general said it will review the Navy's new cost estimate and determine when the revised contract will be approved.

The Pentagon is still in the process of revising the Osprey contract. The AP reported that the Navy says the new cost estimate will be finalized in the first quarter of 2017. (U.S. Navy/Associated Press)

The inspector general's office also noted that the Navy has not yet paid its original $400 million contract to build the MV-22 Osprey."
"The USA has The Lone Ranger on its hands.

Hollywood is not only betting big on the upcoming reboot of the classic 1960s TV show, but it is betting on a new version of the Lone Ranger as well.

The idea is to bring the original actor into the movie, and not a re-cast as in the previous version.

A source told Deadline that Craig Brewer, the actor best known as The Lone Ranger in the 1980s, is on the short list of actors in hopes of taking on the iconic role of the man who rescues a Native American princess from the evil Blackbeard.

Craig Brewer played The Lone Ranger in the 1980s.

The project is being directed by Armie Hammer, who has previously directed hit films like ""The Avengers"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises.""

Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer's Jerry Bruckheimer Productions, the film stars Johnny Depp, Armie Hammer and Armie Hammer's wife, Vanessa Paradis.

Craig Brewer told the Hollywood Reporter that he is ""very open"" about reprising his role in the movie.

""I can't tell you because I don't know what the story is,"" he said. ""I'm very open about whatever I am offered about my involvement. My wife is on board. I think the timing is right.""

He added that he has ""no idea"" how The Lone Ranger will fit in with the new movies, and he wouldn't be surprised if the film one day is rebooted.

The original Lone Ranger was played by John Reid. He first appeared in a 1944 radio play, then was played by Billy Batson in the 1940s TV series and then by Don Taylor in 1967."

"It's not your birthday but at least you're alive, now is the time of the year to celebrate. For me, today is my birthday. I am thirty five. When the day came that I was born I could sense it was going to be a good day. The sun was shining. I had my family, my husband, and my dog. And I remembered my dream. Of having kids. I went and bought some birth control pills. I wasn't ready to have kids at all, I was afraid of it, but I couldn't afford to miss out. I started taking the pills on the weekend after my birthday.

One morning I woke up, very suddenly and with no idea why. I was in a bit of pain. When I realized what was happening I went to my doctor, who told me that I was probably having a miscarriage. The doctor also told me that there was nothing I could have done about it.

I felt a bit sick, so I started taking my birth control pills again. I didn't expect any problems, but that morning one thing was different. I was not feeling well. I went to the doctor the next day who tested me and said that I had high levels of a hormone in my system that made me feel quite sick and tired. He said that they had to inject me more hormones and that I would only recover if I started taking more birth control pills every day to replace the hormones being taken out. When I refused, the doctor told me that one of my kidneys wasn't quite healthy and that it would break down quickly unless it was replenished every day, because it would stop the hormone from being taken out. In other Words, he was trying to make me get pregnant or I would get sick or whatever was needed to make me pregnant.

I asked my husband if he thought that was cruel, and he said it kind of was. So he got me to take a pregnancy test that night while we were watching TV. I had a good feeling and I got excited about when I had to take my pills again. What I didn't realize until now is that I had this feeling that something was wrong before my pill intake. What was wrong that I was feeling bad all the time, but the next time I went to take my pill, I felt so sick I started to cry. I took my pill, but when I woke up again the same morning, I felt completely different. I was scared and I went to my doctor, who told me that I had a virus in my system.

I went back to my doctor and told him that he had better test me right away or I was going to die. And that when he did test me, there was no problem. He couldn't do anything about it. That was the first time I experienced a sense of dread. I didn't know what a virus was, but I knew for sure that I was going to die."

"""The way the technology is being developed, it's going to be a lot easier than people think,"" says one recent graduate of engineering school. ""A lot of people don't think that we can build self-driving cars.""

A recent graduate of the University of South Carolina's College of Engineering says the more pressing concern is how technology will impact the workforce. What's more, the graduates are optimistic about the future of technology and are concerned about how it will impact future generations.

""I know that people will be working in the future and they'll need skills that are available now,"" says Reuben Crockett, a recent graduate of the university's College of Engineering in Columbia, S.C.

The university is considering adding a laboratory to the college to study the development of autonomous cars.

""I think it's going to make the workforce more diverse,"" Crockett says. ""And I think it's going to make people more qualified, because they're not necessarily going to be in a place of concentrated poverty or concentrated education, so they'll be able to find more jobs.""

The graduates say they believe the future of technology will not only allow people to pursue their dreams of becoming a doctor, lawyer or engineer, but also will allow people to become entrepreneurs.

""The days of being in a big company and not being able to have the freedom to do things are behind us. It's a new world,"" says Trevor DeMar, a recent graduate of the university's College of Engineering in Columbia, S.C.

But DeMar says it's not just about jobs in the future.

""You look at the future and what's going to be happening in the world,"" he says. ""It's going to affect a lot of different industries and a lot of different things.""

Many of the graduates say they hope to move up the corporate ladder and that they would like to work for the automotive industry, where they say the technology is already being used.

""There's a lot of interest in the automotive industry, to come work in the automotive industry,"" DeMar says. ""Our degree program is geared for the automotive industry.""

The graduates say the future of technology is not all doom and gloom. The graduates also say they think computers will have a positive impact on life.

""I think the world is going to be a lot better when there's computers,"" says Crockett. ""I think there will be a lot of people who get used to computers, and they'll be able to use computers to do things that they couldn't do before.""

The graduates also say they're optimistic about the future.

""I think the future is really bright,"" says Crockett. ""I think it's going to be a lot more diverse and I think there are lots of opportunities for people.""

Google's self-driving cars made a few test runs in San Francisco last week, but it's still not clear what the tech giant plans to do with them in the long term.

The self-driving cars that Google recently sent to the city were part of a trial run that included a week of testing, but there's no word yet on whether the cars are getting a permanent home in the city.

The cars were equipped with more sensors and cameras than any previous implementations, and can already drive a few miles, according to a Google spokesperson. But that's still a long way from the city's highways, and the tech giant doesn't seem to have a clear plan for how the cars will be used.

""We don't have a long-term plan for them,"" Google's spokesperson told Motherboard. ""We're just trying to get them out there, and see what we can learn.""

The company has been testing the technology in Mountain View, California, since March, and has been testing its vehicles on public roads since September.

Google is one of many tech companies working on a fleet of self-driving cars, but it's far behind the competition. Google's fleet of two Lexus SUVs and a Toyota Prius—each equipped with a variety of sensors and cameras—has logged more than 1.3 million miles, according to the company.

In the future, Google plans to build a self-driving fleet with dozens of automated vehicles that will be constantly roaming the streets of the city. It also wants to train its fleet of cars to drive on city streets, something that's still in the ""exploratory"" phase, Google's spokesperson told Motherboard.

""We're still in the exploratory phase,"" the spokesperson said. ""We'll continue to work with the city to get them out there.""

Google's self-driving cars may not be able to drive down the city's busiest streets, but the company has plans to eventually send them around the city.

""We have a number of different systems that we are looking at,"" Google's spokesperson said. ""We are looking at a bundle of different systems.""

One of those systems is the camera system, which Google hopes to use for street view. The company is also working on a system that will let the cars identify pedestrians.

""We're figuring out how to do that,"" the spokesperson said."
"This morning we're going to meet Andrew Sullivan, the guy with a very large Twitter following and very thin skin.

We'll hear about his long history of tweeting and retweeting people from the right-wing conspiracy wing and the other guy with a very large Twitter following and very thin skin. And we'll learn about the things he's done over the years to get even, and it all leads to his reaction when he was contacted by an anonymous Twitter account called the ""Ghostbusters"" account, which has now become his most famous follower since he started the account in 2007.

We'll talk about his past controversies but mostly about how he responded to the ""Ghostbusters"" account.

I don't remember who originally contacted me to get a Twitter account for a movie he was doing or that it was an ongoing story. I was working on a movie and hadn't started work yet. And I did start work soon afterwards. But what you are hearing now, which started out as an interesting little side project, turns into an extended series of very, very ugly events. And that's pretty much from the moment I started.

The saga began in January of this year. The movie, which I wrote and produced for Columbia Pictures, the company that bought it on behalf of Sony, was in pre-production. We'd been working with an incredible, well-respected writer, Paul Feig, and he was getting ready to write about Ghostbusters.

This was a huge undertaking for the writers, including Paul. And while his work was getting closer, a few people started noticing that the movie didn't feel quite right. At the beginning we all thought the writing was really really good and it was going to be really really fun. But it wasn't until the week leading up to New Year's that I noticed something, that was a little disconcerting.

We had this great writer who was writing a big part of the story who had to step aside because it seemed a few small details were a little off. And then we were shooting the movie a week later and I looked at the dailies, there was nothing weird about them. But it occurred to me that something seemed a little off. So I asked the guys who I was working with in pre-production, they said: ""Oh, that's just the way it's going to be.""

And it kind of dawned on me: ""Hey, that's not always the way it's going to be. And this is how Paul felt. So maybe things aren't so sure of themselves right now? That's why he stepped aside."" And I was just shocked."
"The new design, which appears to be called N4X on the company's website, is the company's strongest smartphone design yet. The phone can be unlocked right out of the box and comes with a removable back panel that can be replaced by any color of the company's customisable wallpaper.

The N4X phone's design is pretty stark. There's a small screen at the bottom and the whole device is curved, not curved to the sides. In terms of build, the entire design is made up of polycarbonate, a material that looks like cardboard, and the front is rounded and not flat.

The phone, like the current N4, is very compact and the 4-inch LCD screen and rear glass look perfectly fine on a big phone. The only downside is that it feels a little fragile to hold.

I noticed a lot of scratches on the plastic frame on my review unit, especially around the power and camera buttons. Fortunately it's a very hard plastic, there's no flex or any chance it will break.

As you can see in all the pictures included, the phone is a little thin and light. The body is only 13 millimetres thick, but the phone is a bit heavy at 143 grams. All of these numbers make it a little too large to be a true pocket-able smartphone, but it's still thin and light.

One nice aspect is the display has a very wide screen aspect ratio of 18:9, like the Nexus 9 tablet. It also comes with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels, which is lower than the Nexus 5's 5.7-inch panel, but still high when you look at pixel-pushing devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge or the new Nexus 6.

The phone has a fingerprint scanner in its power button, which is one of the main selling points for me. I don't mind the sensor on the Nexus 5, because the back panel and power button both work well and don't get in my way. However, the Nexus 5's sensor is not as fast as the one in the N4X.

There's a power button at the bottom of the device, right in front of the volume rocker, which is the right place depending on how you would position a fingerprint recognition button. That said, I found it annoying that it had to be next to the home button to work. I could also see people not using it at all.

The camera module, located on the top, supports 4K resolution video recording on its own. The smartphone sports a 15-megapixel rear camera with laser auto focus and a secondary LED flash on it, as well as a 8-megapixel front camera. In the front, it has a sensor capable of 1080p video recording.

The phone comes with 32GB of on-board storage, which is expandable via microSD card. For the software,"
"On Thursday afternoon, the United States Supreme Court dealt President Obama another devastating blow to his environmental legacy.

The Court upheld an EPA rule requiring that coal-fired power plants comply with tough new emissions standards, a decision President Obama called ""a significant victory for American workers and the environment."" However, environmentalists, led by Tom Steyer, pledged to appeal to the Supreme Court.

That's because a ruling from the nation's highest court is a huge deal. This time, the Court sided with the EPA under a legal theory known as ""Chevron deference,"" which allows regulations from the government to be applied even if regulations were written to prevent similar problems in the future. For this to happen, the Court must find the agency has made a ""substantial construction"" mistake or had to go out of its way to do something that would have caused the problem.

Obama, as the most powerful president in American history who took office with a promise to restore confidence in America's public lands, has never been afraid of standing up to the fossil fuels industry's political allies.

In this case, the Obama administration was under intense pressure from members of Congress who objected to a rule they said would drive down the electricity costs of millions of poor households. And they were worried it was designed solely to appease the Republican base, who demanded coal's continued use in electricity generation despite the fact that carbon emissions from the coal-fired power plants make a huge contribution global warming.

But in a decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court ruled against Chevron deference, saying the EPA did not have to demonstrate ""a connection between the regulation's proposed consequences and a possible environmental effect."" But the Court did say that even if the EPA did decide to ""mitigate the effects"" of the regulation, it could not give up its authority to regulate carbon dioxide.

""Once we hold that the Clean Air Act gives Congress the prerogative to ban polluting activities even where they would not produce significant adverse environmental effects, we lose all ability to protect the most sacred of American values—our air,"" Roberts wrote. ""We decline to rewrite history to make the act of creation look like the act of destruction.""

The decision does have implications for Obama the following months. If the lower courts deem the EPA ruling ""unenforceable,"" the Obama administration won't be able to use it. While the Court has upheld EPA rulemaking powers, the EPA can never use any new regulation as a backdoor way of enforcing a rule it previously abandoned.

The ruling effectively renders the Clean Air Act, which has been under congressional assault since the 1970s, effectively dead. It's the first time in nearly 40 years that the Supreme Court has been the one preventing the President from enforcing a regulation.

In other areas of business, there is little doubt that the Roberts court has already acted in accordance with its political agenda. Last year, two of the"
"The story of the Land Rover Discovery is one of the greatest automotive stories ever told.

The odd-looking, rear-engined vehicle was the brainchild of a company called Rover-Ltd and would go on to become one of the best-selling vehicles ever made.

When the Discovery was introduced, it was a bit of a ""land rover"" for the era. It was built to explore dry land as well as rocky areas. It had a relatively low center of gravity and could easily negotiate tough terrain, making it ideal for exploring foreign lands and even conquering the seemingly impenetrable Himalayas.

The Discovery was also the first vehicle to have a manual transmission, which was a big deal at the time. The manual transmission was also the first vehicle to be equipped with cruise control. The drive-by-wire system made it possible for the driver to apply the brakes while driving.

The vehicle was so successful that it went on to become the most successful car of all time, selling 15.7 million units across the globe. It was also the first vehicle to be sold in over 60 different countries, making it one of the most popular vehicles of all time.

It is also unusual in that it is one of only two vehicles in history to have been all-wheel drive.

The Discovery has been around for almost 40 years now and, with the new Defender, it looks like it could continue to mop up the awards.

Though the old Defender is no longer an option, Land Rover is apparently hard at work to bring it back.

"""How do you beat God?""

On the day of his death, Joseph Smith is thought to have been on the earth for approximately two years, during which time he would have taught and prophesied. In his lifetime, he preached the restored gospel, wrote many books, and founded the Church.

What exactly did he accomplish during his two-year journey of self-discovery? The Joseph Smith Papers Project has compiled more than 500 pages of documents related to his life through interviews, documents, documents.org, and online archives. We are a collection of scholars, historians, and church members who are collaborating using both original sources and online resources. We have so far made over 800 documents, including letters, journals, correspondence, and speeches, available online and on the Joseph Smith Papers blog. We will be adding many more as we discover more documents and as they are made available online.

The following excerpts from Joseph Smith's correspondence offer insight into his life and achievements. The emphasis is on the personal, not the ecclesiastical, aspects of his history. For example, we have included a letter from Joseph Smith to Orson Hyde about the Saints' plan to settle in Nauvoo because the Nauvoo Legion would be too small to defend them. These personal, unsparing letters are one reason why they are a valuable, if not unique, glimpse into his character. They also reflect the remarkable personality he had, and are a reflection of the person Joseph taught and worked with daily. In particular, Joseph Smith was passionate about history and the mission it can bring. By sharing their vision and experiences in the context of the history he wanted to write, his letters show us how he would have wanted others to perceive his life, ministry, teachings, and legacy.

"""It's very easy to look at the circumstances that led to the tragic death of the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and say the pastor's actions were the cause of his death,"" said Rev. Michael Smith, executive director of the Illinois Association of Ministries. ""But that would be to seriously undervalue his ministry.""

Mr. Carpenter, a senior pastor at the church, was charged in March with involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide in the death of his wife, Sarah Carpenter, 39, who was found dead in the couple's home on May 9.

According to Mr. Smith, Mr. Carpenter had been ""in and out of depression and mental illness"" for years. He built a foundation for his church in the form of a house church that had grown into a multi-generational congregation. But Mr. Smith said that the church had been in financial trouble for some time, and the pastor had made ""some financial decisions that were not prudent.""

""The community saw him as a source of strength and encouragement, and it is tragic that he took his own life,"" the Rev. Smith said.

Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, which oversees the church, said in a statement that it had been trying to find Mr. Carpenter a new home and was seeking legal counsel.

""We are saddened by the loss of our pastor, and we are praying for the victims' families and for us as a church community,"" said the statement, issued Saturday morning. ""We have been in contact with the families and are offering our continued support. We are committed to ensuring that the church will be open for worship on Sunday.""

Mr. Carpenter, who was chief of staff to the church's pastor, the Rev. John G. Kriese, was arrested in November in the death of his son and daughter-in-law, who were found dead in their St. Louis home.

Mr. Kriese, who was found dead in his office on Jan. 31, was one of five church leaders charged in the death of Mr. Kriese's wife, Abigail Kriese, who was found dead in her home on June 14.

Mr. Carpenter was charged in the death of his wife, but the church was not in contact with law enforcement authorities at the time of his arrest. The church has not yet filed charges against Mr. Carpenter.

""We are deeply saddened by this tragedy,"" the church said in a statement. ""We have reached out to the family and offered our prayers. We are not yet ready to make any comments.""

After Ms. Carpenter's death, the church sought to make changes, including hiring an administrator to serve as interim pastor, Rev. Smith said.

But the changes were not enough.

""What we've been seeing over the last 18 months is that the church as a whole is hurt"
"We'll never forget the N5. While it only lasted a few months, it's still a very fond memory of our early days in the industry. Even though it was a bit of a runt, it gave us a lot of priceless lessons about the business, to this day.

Fortunately, Sony has revived the N5 in the form of the N5 Dual. It's not quite as impressive as the original N5, but it's still a great phone with a lot of great features.

So, what's new? Naturally, plenty, but here's a summary of the key changes.

5-inch, 1080p display

Acer Liquid Jade Primo

With the N5 Dual, Sony has doubled down on the 5-inch, 1080p display. It's the same size as the N5, but the screen has been bumped up from 4.8 inches to 5.2 inches.

It's still a 1080p display, but with a higher resolution. It's the same 800 x 480 pixels as before, but we're seeing pixel density up to 400ppi. We're not sure how much you'll notice, but it's noticeably larger than the old 4.8-inch screen, and it looks great.

You can't see the difference in the images above, but the display is very sharp, and the colors are very accurate. We even found the display to be a little more vibrant than the N5.

The display is much brighter than before, and it has an ambient light sensor that adjusts the brightness based on the ambient light. We would have liked to see Sony move up to an IPS panel, but they stuck with LCD in the Dual.

It's a very bright display, but Sony isn't messing around. It's a Sony IPS panel, so it's perfectly capable of handling the bright, sunny summer days we're all used to.

Acer Liquid Jade Primo

The new Liquid Jade Primo is an Android 4.1 Jelly Bean device with an to-be-announced Intel Atom processor. It's the same chipset as the N5 Dual, and it will be available in two variants: one with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, and another with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.

The 2GB model will cost $129.99, and the 4GB model will cost $149.99. The difference? RAM. The 2GB model will have 2GB of RAM, and the 4GB model will have 4GB of RAM.

The memory clock speeds are slightly different. The 2GB model will be running at 1.9GHz, and the 4GB model will run at 2.5GHz. The N5 Dual's 8GB of RAM will still run at 2.5GHz, however.

The new Liquid Jade Primo also has a slightly larger"
"I've seen a lot of people discuss the U.S. Constitution as if it were some sort of ""holy book"" with all the answers to life's problems. While I agree that it's a significant book with a lot of good concepts, I think it's important to remember that it's not the only guide to a good life. Like the Bible, the Constitution is a guide, but it's not the only guide.

As someone who has studied the Constitution extensively, I've found that some of the most common misconceptions about the Constitution are based on an assumption that the Constitution is a ""set of rules"" that can be followed ""as is"" or ""as is to be.""

The Constitution was made to serve as a guide for our nation and not a set of rules that can be followed ""as is"" or ""as is to be"" or ""as is."" People who think that way are missing the point of what the Constitution is—and what it is for.

To give us an idea of what the Constitution is for, here are five examples of things the Constitution is not for:

The Constitution is not a collection of laws.

The Constitution is not the Bible.

The Constitution is not a set of rules that can be followed as is.

The Constitution is not a set of rules that can be followed as is with all-knowing certainty.

The Constitution is not a set of rules that can be followed as is with all-knowing certainty.

5. The Constitution Is Not a Collection of Laws

Many people believe that the Constitution is a set of laws. This is, of course, a simplistic assumption. The Constitution is a document that attempts to give the people a guide for how their government is supposed to function. As the Framers of the Constitution pointed out, laws are made by the people, for the people, and all laws should be interpreted by the people.

It's easy to see how the Constitution can serve as a set of rules—there are some rules that apply to all forms of government. But the Constitution is far from a set of rules. The Constitution contains some rules but also contains many exceptions to those rules, so the Constitution is not a set of rules.

4. The Constitution Is Not the Bible

Many people, including many Christians, think that the Constitution is a ""holy book"" containing all the answers to life's problems. But the Constitution is not a collection of scriptures. The Constitution is a document that attempts to give the people a guide for how their government is supposed to function.

There are many good things in the Constitution, but the Constitution is not the Bible. While it's true that the Constitution contains a lot of good things, it's also true that many of those good things are not directly applicable to every life situation. The Bible is the one book that can be used as a"
"The Democratic Party has is a large, diverse, and rapidly growing group of Americans, which includes many who are both Democrats and Republicans. And while the party has become more diverse over the last decade, the number of Republican-leaning independents has grown, as it has for Democrats.

In 2015, more than half (54%) of all likely voters are independents who lean Republican, according to the new survey from the Pew Research Center. That's an increase of 10 percentage points since 2005.

Among those who describe themselves as Democrats or lean Democratic, the proportion of independents who are Republicans has remained relatively stable, at 45%. And among those who describe themselves as independents who lean Republican, 17% now say they are Democrats or lean Democratic.

The continued Republicans' hold on the GOP primary electorate and the Democrats' ongoing struggle to attract independent voters is an important reason why the number of Republicans has grown so rapidly, Pew says. From 2004 to 2009, the GOP's share of the Republican primary electorate fell from 37% to 25%. The Democratic share rose from 30% to 38%, but the number of independents in the mix fell from 18% to 17%.

The rise in the number of independents in the Republican primary electorate is led by white evangelicals, who now constitute about 20% of Republican likely voters, up from 11% in 2004. The proportion of religiously unaffiliated Republicans, meanwhile, has increased from 1% in 2004 to 3% today.

White evangelical Protestants make up the largest share of Democratic-leaning independents in the country, with 56% of them. White mainline Protestants, Catholics and white mainline Protestants also make up a large share of Democratic-leaning independents, and the share of religiously unaffiliated Democrats has declined over the last 15 years.

The share of independents who say they are independent and lean independent has stayed fairly stable over the last 15 years. But the share of independent and independent-leaning voters who describe themselves as Democrats has increased, from 66% in 2004 to 79% today."
"""The record shows that the federal government has been using taxpayer funds to promote the writing of a book about a man in a wheelchair, and that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has documented the use of taxpayer funds on an anti-transgender website as well. ""This is not an isolated case. The Obama administration has spent taxpayer dollars on a range of programs that have promoted and protected same-sex marriage and the rights of transgender Americans. ""This is not a partisan issue. The Obama administration's record on equality for LGBT Americans has been abysmal. It has failed to protect the civil rights of LGBT Americans and has allowed states and localities to discriminate against LGBT Americans.""


The paragraph in question actually does not make much sense. It's a pushback to Gillibrand's statement that the administration is ""promoting and protecting"" the rights of transgender Americans, and she was simply referring to the fact that the administration has spent plenty of money on anti-transgender programs.

However, the paragraph was not the only ""fact check"" that has gone viral.

In fact, this one has been shared around more than 1.1 million times. It's about as inaccurate as the CBO's record on health care, but still better than the anti-trans bathroom bill and other falsehoods.

The story below was written by Lena Dunham, who is the creator of ""Girls,"" the HBO show about a group of young women living in New York.

In the wake of the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, ""Girls"" creator and star Lena Dunham has started a social media campaign aimed at ending anti-LGBT bullying in schools.

The campaign has two goals: to raise awareness about anti-LGBT bullying in schools and to urge Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would ban discrimination against LGBT people in all sectors of the economy, including public and private schools.

Dunham, who was raised in the South but now lives in New York, is a strong advocate for LGBT rights, including marriage equality.

""It's disgusting that we still have to fight for basic rights,"" she told The Huffington Post. ""There is no place in our country for anti-LGBT bullying. If we can't get an education, if we can't get a job, if we can't get a home, then we can't get an education, can't get a job, can't get a home. And you can't do anything about that. It's that simple.""

Dunham says that the campaign started on Twitter, where she wrote: ""Thank you for all the messages of love and support for #EqualityDay. #StopBullying #StopBullyingBullying.""

Cardiff Blues are set to sign Wales wing Jamie Roberts as a replacement for the injured Dan Biggar.

The Blues have already secured the services of hooker Davit Zirakashvili on a short-term deal.

The pair will join up with the rest of the squad on their return from the England autumn internationals in a fortnight.

The latest addition will be confirmed as a replacement for Biggar, who suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder and is out of the Wales squad.

Roberts, 25, previously played for the Blues for two seasons.

He joined the club from Ospreys in 2014 and played 35 times before being loaned out to the Ospreys for the 2015-16 season.

He then returned to the Blues in 2017 and has made 30 appearances in the second tier.

Commenting on Roberts' return to Wales, Blues head coach Danny Wilson said: ""He's been one of the better players in the country this year and he's been terrific in the Ospreys series.

""He's been playing at a very high level for the last two years and I was hoping he could be a big part of the squad.

""He's the kind of player who can play in different positions and he's very versatile so he can come in and play in the second row or in the wing position.

""He's a leader in the group and he's been a great player for us over the last two years.

""Having said that, we have a number of players who have been second row players at international level and I think it's important to have players who can play in different positions.

""He's the kind of player we're looking to bring in to the squad."""

The Tomb Raider reboot has been in the works for almost two years, but today's announcement has finally confirmed the game's release date.

Exit Theatre Mode

Announced by Crystal Dynamics' Jason Connell at a press event in London, the sequel to 2013's Tomb Raider reboot will be released on March 16, 2016.

""The journey of Lara Croft is one that spans three games, two in the original series and one in the reboot,"" said Connell, ""and we've spent a long time working on it... and it's finally coming together.""

""The way we see it is that the world and the story that we're telling is pretty much the only way to tell the story of Lara Croft - and that's our intention,"" he added. ""But we want to give Tomb Raider fans the chance to experience the game in a way that they have never experienced it before. In that sense, we're going to be showing a lot of the game, and we hope the players will be able to share their impressions with us.""

Exit Theatre Mode

The game will release for current- generation consoles, as well as PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The original Tomb Raider was released for the Xbox in 2001 and is currently available on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

"""Could I be a girl?""

I asked myself that question. I had been male for most of my life, and everything I'd known about ""being a girl"" revolved around the idea that it was something I ""didn't want"" or something I was ""supposed to be."" I'd even had a few friends who were trans, and none of them ever expressed any interest in transitioning.

I was not ready to change.

Then one day I was looking on the internet for a friend who was trans, and found her on a trans support group. I found out that she wasn't planning on transitioning, and that she was happy with her gender identity.

""Could I be trans?""

""Yes,"" she told me. ""You could.""

As I began to understand more about trans people, I began to think about my own experiences. I always knew that I was a girl, but I'd never been able to explain what it was like being a girl. I knew that I liked being a girl, but I was the only one who knew.

It didn't make sense to me.

I started to get really interested in trans issues, and I was particularly interested in the way that the media presented trans people as a ""lifestyle choice."" How could a person who is biologically male become a woman? And why does society treat trans people as though they are making a ""lifestyle choice,"" when most people who transition are profoundly unhappy with their bodies?

These questions were extremely difficult to answer, and I didn't even know how to start.

But what I did know was that I wanted to explore my gender identity.

Transgender people are born with the gender they are assigned at birth, but gender identity is something that develops over time as a person grows up. I was made to feel very different by my parents, and treated very differently by society. I saw myself as a boy growing up, and a girl growing into teenage girlhood, and never felt comfortable with either label.

As I began to look more into the lives of trans people, I was shocked to hear that most people who transition are unhappy with their bodies. I saw how many of the people I knew had been through surgeries, hormone treatments, and electrolysis to try and change the way they looked.

I had never considered that the people who were willing to undergo all of this were probably unhappy with their bodies in the first place. I had been a boy in an all-boys' school, and I was trying to be a girl. But I was still a boy. I had never thought about how my body would feel like when I transitioned.

I had always known that I was female, but without knowing why, I had never considered that there was anything wrong with me.

For me, discovering that being a trans girl was not a ""lifestyle"
"This morning, the White House announced President Obama's plan to sign an executive order aimed at raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. In a statement, Obama said:

Too often America's lowest-paid workers don't have a voice in Washington. I believe if Washington doesn't listen to the people, Congress should. That's why today I am taking a historic step to give hardworking Americans a raise: An executive action to raise the minimum wage for federal contract employees from $7.25 an hour to $10.10. It's an action I can take right now because Congress failed to act.

He used the same language he used a couple of years ago to justify another move to raise wages: in March, the President signed an executive order raising the minimum wage for contractors on federal contracts to $10.10 per hour.

The President, though, has never explained how raising wages for people earning minimum wage will make the economy more profitable. While the White House says his executive action will be designed to raise the standard of living for these workers, there are no data to support this claim. As the New York Times notes:

The federal minimum wage has not been raised in almost 20 years… Mr. Obama's recent actions will increase the pay of tens of millions of lower-income Americans in the form of higher overtime pay, and more. But there is no evidence to back up this claim that the pay would stimulate the economy.

The administration has repeatedly claimed that raising the minimum wage would boost economic growth, while economists around the country have repeatedly debunked their claims. In fact, the White House's latest claims have not actually been tested by the White House's own economists.

And in fact, this will hurt many low-wage workers when the economy recovers. Low-wage families are already struggling the most since the recession because they are working more hours than ever before to try to support themselves and their families, and because their incomes have been stagnant due to long economic trends. The President's latest move will only worsen this problem, not help it.

Advertisement

Update:

Since this story first ran, the White House has released further information to make its claim more reasonable. The White House now says that the wage hike will benefit 1.6 million workers (but this only includes the workers who will receive more than the minimum wage, not the workers who will receive an increase).

In a report released Monday, the Office of the Attorney General said it found Denver's Department of Revenue was aware the money was being used to buy the policy, but did not alert the city to this fact.

The settlement was initially announced in 2009 after the Denver Post newspaper reported it was being used to cover costs of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., but many questions still surround the money's fate.

The City of Denver bought the policy through a commercial firm, and it remains with the firm. The state says the policy has been in limbo in Colorado for years because of the city's failure to pay, and it could still be at risk.

""The death benefit policy and the policy holder's property may be at risk if the state does not receive the funds from the settlement,"" the city attorney's office said in a statement.

Attorney General John Suthers said his staff will continue to look into the case. Earlier this summer, state agents and investigators from the state's Office of the Complaint Review Board reviewed the case.

Suthers said his office will investigate how the issue was handled at the city as well.

""I am committed to ensuring that the city takes appropriate steps to ensure accountability within its city departments and that accountability in these particular circumstances is addressed,"" Suthers said.

The $2.7 million settlement was reached last summer in court in Denver before the City Council. It required the city to pay $1.5 million to the wife of the victim and the rest to his sister until the money was paid out.

The mother-of-four was an unarmed teen shot and killed after being pulled over by officer Ryan O'Shea in Denver on Oct. 16, 2009. She claimed that O'Shea fired five bullets into her car after her car veered off the road, shattering her windshield and killing her 3-year-old son, T.G.

The city initially paid $6,500 and said the money was to settle the claims. A federal grand jury declined to indict T.G.'s mother over the death.

Suthers' office said Monday that one of the most significant findings in the report ""is that not a single policyholder was properly identified.""

""The City made no effort to identify and identify policyholders,"" the report said. ""Had it identified them, it would have required that the policy be sold, in which event the City could have re-examined and assessed the life insurance policy proceeds.""

The city attorney's office said it's working to make sure policyholders are identified.

In 2012, the Colorado Insurance Council awarded Denver a $6,000 settlement for not identifying homeowners who were covered under the city's city"

In the coming days, the bureau's Criminal Investigation Division will be conducting additional interview strategies with individuals we believe may have had additional contacts or conversations with Mr. Lee. Because we're still actively investigating this incident, we need the public's help to identify other individuals who they believe were involved too. We're asking them to call us at (717) 531-7000."

SEATTLE -- A woman who says she was ""raped through the airway"" by an Air Canada flight attendant has settled with the aircraft's owner, after the federal aviation agency refused to take action against the woman, saying that ""all passengers have the right not to be sexually harassed.""


The woman, who remains unnamed in court documents, went public with her claim in May 2011, and said in court documents that the incident had caused her ""stress, anxiety and trauma.""


The incident, which allegedly occurred in February on a United flight from Chicago to Vancouver, was part of a nationwide campaign by the airline and others to bring more attention to an airline incident known as the ""mugging epidemic"" that has been making headlines recently.


In 2010, a federal judge ruled that a man from Kentucky had been unfairly suspended for three months after he allegedly exposed himself on a United flight.


A man in California was placed on a one-year ban after he allegedly tried to grope a woman who had just left a restaurant.


The settlement of the case is reported to be in the $1 million to $2 million range, with an unknown amount of insurance that the man bought as part of the settlement paying $50,000 to $75,000. A woman who was a passenger on the United plane did not pursue a lawsuit against the airline for sexual harassment because she said she did not wish to bring attention to the issue.


The woman in the Air Canada case had filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court claiming that a flight attendant sexually harassed her and called her a ""carpet muncher"" and ""snake oil salesman.""


But the federal agency declined to take any action against the flight attendants, saying that all passengers have the right not to be sexually harassed.


The FAA's Office of Compliance said Friday in a statement that the ""agency finds the allegations filed by passenger in the suit against one or more Air Canada flight staff to be unsubstantiated"" and that the agency ""believes that all passengers have the right not to be sexually harassed.""


The statement added that sexual harassment is an issue to be addressed on the airline's own as well as the flight attendant's training.


The woman who filed this case said in the documents released by her attorney that she asked to speak to the crew at Canada's Stanstead, and was told that ""the flight attendant's 'job is simply to be there and serve, and that's it.""


The woman said that the crew then ""came under attack. They were being called ugly names and they were being subjected to sexual comments.""


She accused the flight attendants of attempting to humiliate her.


According to court documents, an attorney for the airline, Barry Carpetier, questioned why there should be a sexual harassment situation at all.


""I would think that this sort of thing"
"On a cold Wednesday morning, a group of women from the local Green Party stood outside a polling station in Brooklyn to challenge men waiting in line – who, they said, were trying to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton.

While several were wearing badges reading ""Women for Hillary,"" most had no prior contact with the party. The group, which included a woman who identified herself as ""Pamela,"" gathered to make their points – and, in some cases, get their names signed on the Democratic Party's record.

""This is a historic moment,"" Pamela told me. ""This is what happens when grassroots feminists unite against the patriarchy.""

Pamela, who lives on a street abutting Clinton's North Arlington, New York, polling place, said, ""Women in this country still earn less and have less leverage and less power than our male counterparts. They're still more likely to be victims than perpetrators, more likely to be victims of violent crime … and are still more likely to be victims of poverty, not just in urban areas but across the entire country."" She added, ""So our agenda really is about the fundamental rights of our gender, our equality to be taken seriously and respected.""

The New York voting site was bustling with people. There were already dozens of Hillary Clinton supporters who had already filed in, having arrived at 8 a.m. Some were dressed in their Sunday best; many more were wearing ""I Voted"" stickers.

Pamela, who was wearing a red ""Women for Hillary"" t-shirt (and didn't have the t-shirt off) said that she had met a man at City Hall early in the morning and, as they talked, he asked her if Clinton was on her ticket. ""Yes!"" Pamela recalled telling him. ""What about Clinton, she's the women's candidate, how can you vote for Trump!"" she continued. ""I said, 'Listen, I don't agree with her politics, but I believe the other women running for office, who are my sisters, they're better than Trump.' ""

Pamela said that, throughout this entire conversation with this man, she kept apologizing for him. She acknowledged that she was only saying things she knew her friends, who were supporting Clinton, would agree with. But she said that, even for just that conversation, ""I had no reason not to believe this person, that this man was not in the thrall of his own sexism.""

"Saskatchewan's health minister says the province's new drug-treatment program is costing $1 million per year and he's asking the province's health regulator to consider a waiver of the program's eligibility requirements.

In an interim report released this morning, the Saskatchewan Medical Officer of Health warns that the proposed five-year, $25-billion Saskatchewan Drug Screening Program is unnecessary and could leave people with serious drug dependencies without treatment.

In its own report last month, the provincial government estimated that just 30 per cent of those entering the program will require drug treatment after a five-year wait. The program is supposed to have at least 90 per cent of its first 10 years free of charge.

""It's hard to determine the cost of the program without knowing how it operates,"" said Dr. Ed Ouellette, minister of health. ""The best approach would be to see if we could make a change in eligibility standards... and to see if that could save money.""

Under the proposed program, applicants must be assessed by an approved addiction professional, provide a urine sample and submit to a medical examination. The province will pay for the first $20,000 of initial costs for an addiction professional.

It also says only those eligible, in certain areas, may receive a referral to the program.

The program currently covers outpatient care at designated locations.

If Ouellette's recommendation goes through, it would mean the province's medical-marijuana program, one of the few in the country, would have to apply to the Canada Health Act for a waiver.

The provincial Health Department said in a statement that it has received Ouellette's report and is discussing it with the Saskatchewan Ombudsman.

Ouellette also wants the Saskatchewan government to put the money from new tax revenue on addiction treatment instead of on alcohol and drugs. ""We need to look at whether it's just really a health issue or it's also an economic issue,"" he said."
"The Obama administration is sending a ""detailed plan"" to Congress ahead of a decision on building the Keystone XL pipeline, but lawmakers are not sure if it will include language that would grant President Obama the ability to bypass Congress on the issue.

The White House said Saturday that the draft will be released as soon as next week, but Republican lawmakers and Democrats said they were waiting to see the details in order to decide whether to support the project.

The State Department is currently reviewing the final environmental impact statement (EIS) from TransCanada, the Canadian company behind the pipeline, and has until Oct. 1 to make a determination on the project's future.

Lawmakers from both political parties have stressed that a decision about the project should not be made before the State Department makes its decision and provides Congress with the opportunity to weigh in.

""Once the issue is settled on the merits, we will seek to pass legislation to make it easier and more efficient to get this project built,"" Hoeven said in a statement.

But State Department spokesman John Kirby said the department was still working on the draft and did not have specifics to share yet.

""The State Department is still reviewing the environmental analysis and finalizing the document as it relates to the Keystone pipeline,"" Kirby said in a statement. ""As we do so, we will be providing a detailed plan to Congress and the American people.""

The State Department's decision to move forward on the project is crucial, since lawmakers have said they won't approve it unless the administration gives Congress a direct say in the matter.

But environmentalists argue the pipeline would lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, while Republicans say it would create jobs and help the economy. The State Department is also wrestling with the fate of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has been stopped by the courts.

"As most of our nation struggles, I'm reminded by a little-noticed report from the American Foundation for the Blind that one in ten people in the United States are blind or visually impaired.

The report, conducted by The Center for Vision in Society for the National Federation of the Blind, estimates that approximately 30 million people — about 1 in 10 of all Americans — are visually impaired.

That's roughly 20 percent of our population, which translates to about 25 million people with disabilities or blindness. If we are to address the disability crisis, I believe that it is imperative that we also confront the challenges and opportunities that come with being blind or visually impaired.

As I've said many times during my time as Vice President, it's time we end the myth that blindness and vision loss are a sign of social and economic failure. There is no such thing as societal blindness, as we're all part of the society and no one is better off for being blind.

The challenge can't be fully addressed without recognizing the differences of vision among everyone, without discriminating against someone based on their vision. I truly believe that all those people who are blind or vision impaired deserve more than just the American Foundation for the Blind's $5 million annual operating budget.

I am proud, as I am with all the FVBOA chapters here in America, to have a board of directors, each representing a different eye. With each board of directors, we seek to be inclusive and open minded – seeking the input and advice of all – as we come to understand differences and share common interests.

I am especially proud to have served as the Chairman of the Board for the Blind Students Association – a organization of blind and visually impaired students – whose mandate is to advocate for the advancement of the blind community while promoting, promoting and promoting.

My personal experience as I am learning that I don't ""fit in"" — because of a condition beyond my control — was very difficult. It meant I had to seek out and explore people outside of my own family, friends and community to understand who I am and what I am able to do.

If you want my perspective on how hard it was to see the value in being an individual first, then read this. My point is that I'm not going to deny my vision or other blind people the opportunities to do important things, as I believe our vision deficit will be addressed when we are able to truly see the world and our blind and visually impaired brethren as individuals – regardless of their ability to read, or be able to communicate with others.

Today, I ask for your support. If you or someone you know is sight impaired, please consider becoming a member of FVBOA and the FVBOA affiliate in your community. If you have been a part of the FVBOA and affiliate, please feel free to share your experiences and advice.

"Protein synthesis is a process whereby the body breaks down existing cells into the amino acids that are necessary for growth and health. Proteins cannot be manufactured and therefore must be ingested, either by food or supplement, to supply the body with protein.

Protein synthesis is a two-stage process, with the first step happening early in the feeding cycle, followed by the second and final step in a post-feeding scenario in which the post-feeding state is where most of the body's protein is produced and stored. Although the timing or duration of this process is dependent on many factors, two aspects are generally agreed upon. The first is that it typically occurs within 30 to 60 minutes of initiation of feeding, and is followed by about 1 hour and 45 minutes of protein degradation. The second is that protein synthesis does not stop until some point of a few days or weeks has passed. Although these are the general guidelines for the rate of protein synthesis, different individuals vary greatly in their rate of protein synthesis, with the most rapid rates seen in young people, adolescents, those with sickle cell disease and in menopausal women.

The rate of protein synthesis can increase or decrease as the body attempts to synthesize more or more protein in response to dietary intake. In some scenarios this process can be seen as being excessive since protein ingestion causes the body to consume more or less protein daily until the body can complete the necessary amount with minimal degradation of those that are used. However, in many cases, such as in menopausal women where there is a slow rate of protein synthesis, the post-feeding time for the body to break down the protein that has already been ingested and supply the body with the amino acids it requires has become very long at a rate that does not allow for the consumption of a significant amount of amino acids to maintain amino acid status. As a result, the body becomes deficient in amino acids and must take amino acids stored within the body to try to replenish that which is lacking due to depletion.

The two basic strategies to compensate for this lack of the amino acids required for protein synthesis are fast protein uptake or increasing the production of amino acids in the body from dietary intake. Fast protein uptake is the main physiological mechanism used to increase the amount of protein in the body in the initial stages of protein turnover and is also used to counteract the negative effects of protein intake that can occur in various situations, including protein deprivation and starvation due to inadequate protein intake. The main consequence associated with the fast protein uptake is, in this scenario, rapid skeletal muscle cell breakdown that does not occur until the second post-feeding stage.

An example of this type of physiological adaptation to protein intake is seen in children and adolescents where, because of the rapid increase in the rate of protein synthesis that occurs early on in post-feeding situations, the rate of protein synthesis actually increases in the initial post-feeding period. During this initial period of post-feeding protein production, amino"
"The authorities in North Korea are now reportedly using electric shock punishment on people for ""immoral"" opinions, according to a report in the country's state-run newspaper.

""We are now using electric shock punishment on people who commit 'immoral' behavior,"" said Kim Yong Ho, a former official at the Ministry of People's Security, according to the Rodong Sinmun.

Kim was referring to the arrest and punishment of Kim Hyon Chol, former manager of a Seoul-based cosmetics company, for ""insulting the supreme leadership.""

Kim is reported to have been sentenced to six to 15 days of ""electrocution"" with electric current for ""insulting the supreme leadership,"" according to the newspaper. The punishment was reportedly carried out on Thursday.

The newspaper did not specify what kind of conduct Kim has been punished for, but it is likely that the punishment will have to do with his past work with a cosmetics company.

Kim had reportedly been fired from his previous job in December after he made comments to a newspaper reporter criticizing the country's leadership.

The arrest and punishment of Kim Hyon Chol comes on the heels of the arrest and sentencing of one of North Korea's top diplomats, Kim Won Hong, who is now serving a 15-year sentence for ""trying to overthrow the government,"" according to the Associated Press.

Kim Won Hong was a member of the North Korean delegation to the fourth round of talks with South Korea in late April."

A new study has found that the human gut microbiome may influence the likelihood of becoming obese. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the presence of certain bacteria in the gut led to a more rapid metabolism and higher energy expenditure after a meal.

The microbiome is the collection of trillions of bacteria that live in the digestive tract of humans and other animals. It includes species that are helpful to the host and those that cause harm.

In recent years, research has shown that the composition of the bacterial makeup in our intestines can be altered by our diet and lifestyle. For example, consuming a diet rich in fiber, probiotics, and other beneficial bacteria can significantly boost the diversity and diversity of the bacteria living in our GI tract.

A new study, published in the journal Nature, has found that the human gut microbiome may influence the likelihood of becoming obese. The research, conducted by researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, found that the presence of certain bacteria in the gut led to a more rapid metabolism and higher energy expenditure after a meal.

""We found that people who were that had a greater abundance of Bifidobacterium, which is found in the human gut, had a more rapid metabolic rate and increased energy expenditure,"" study author Dr. Brian Wansink, professor of human nutrition at the University of Connecticut, told Medical Daily. ""There was no difference in muscle mass between those groups, but they had the same rate of caloric expenditure.""

The researchers were looking for a link between gut bacteria and obesity, which is a common condition. Their study, which was published in the journal Nature, concluded that the gut microbiome influenced the development of obesity.

The researchers examined 16 obese and 28 lean adults. The researchers collected stool samples from each participant. The stool samples were analyzed for the presence of bacterial species that are known to influence our metabolism.

After analyzing the stool samples, the researchers found that the participants with a greater abundance of Bifidobacterium in their guts had a greater rate of caloric expenditure and a greater body mass index.

The researchers did note that the difference in rate of caloric expenditure between the 2 groups was only 8 percent, which is not enough to determine that the individuals with a greater abundance of Bifidobacterium in their guts were more likely to become obese. However, the researchers did find that the bacteria had a greater effect on the participants' bodies than did other dietary factors.

""The authors did not find any difference in the hormonal status of the obese and lean groups, nor did they find any difference in metabolic rate between the two groups,"" Wansink added. ""What they found was that the bacteria in the gut affected the metabolic rate of the gut.""

In addition, the researchers found that the bacterial composition in the gut was correlated with the metabolic rate.

"Shelley Deeter has been much in the news lately, not only for her impassioned speeches but for her odd behavior at Congressional hearings. On February 2, Ms. Deeter was shown on video being escorted out of a Congressional hearing room by Capitol Police officers after she was seen shouting obscenities at the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa, and his staff.

""Get your f---ing a-- off my f---ing committee!"" she yelled at the top of her lungs.

As Deeter made her way out of the hearing, she was surrounded by Capitol Police officers who kept her away from the committee and the committee's chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.

According to the Associated Press, the incident ""was the latest in a string of bizarre incidents involving Deeter, who has been reprimanded by the committee for similarly outrageous behavior during previous hearings.""

The incident is not the first time Deeter has been in the news for her inappropriate behavior. In the summer of 2006, she was seen at a Congressional hearing on the VIPER program, an initiative initiated by President George W. Bush to monitor airport security at U.S. airports in an effort to detect terrorists. According to USA Today, Deeter questioned the necessity of the program, which was aimed at detecting terrorists and criminals, and even claimed that TSA agents were ""not very nice people.""

In addition to the inappropriate behavior she displayed during the 2006 hearing, Deeter also reportedly had trouble with security at airports in Florida and Colorado. In 2006, she was arrested by police at Fort Lauderdale International Airport after she was accused of ""saying rude and offensive things"" to security officers.

In September of 2006, Deeter was arrested by police at Denver International Airport after she was accused of ""saying rude and offensive things"" to security officers.

In October of 2003, Deeter also was arrested by police at Denver International Airport after she was accused of ""making lewd and obscene comments"" and ""saying rude and offensive things"" to security officers.

Deeter has also been charged with disorderly conduct in 1998 in relation to an incident at the World Trade Center.

In an interview with Fox News last year, Deeter said: ""Why should I stop? I'm not going to stop or go away. I'm not going to change my behavior or my opinions, because they are what they are and I'm not going to apologize for them.""

She added: ""I do what I do. I know what I'm talking about.""

In addition to the arrest in the 2006 hearing, Deeter has been arrested for misdemeanor battery and disorderly conduct in Florida and Colorado. She also has a criminal record for assault, battery, trespassing, vandalism, and drug possession.

Deeter has been married to Morris Deeter since 1983. She is the mother of 11"

"The 10-year-old boy who was charged with attempted first-degree murder in the stabbing death of his classmate in August 2013 has been released from federal custody.

According to Washington County Assistant State's Attorney Jeffrey Hall, the boy, who was 16 at the time of the murder, was released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons after being presented with an agreement signed by his lawyers.

Hall said the boy's lawyers agreed to dismiss the charges unless the boy and his mother agreed to terms, such as entering a plea.

""It's a wonderful thing that the boy was released today,"" Hall told KIRO Radio's Dori Monson. ""He's going to have a chance to live his life and start over.""

The boy's mother, who was with him when he was charged, was in court and did not comment, Hall said.

In August 2013, the boy and his friend, 15-year-old Michael Brown, were arrested after the boy allegedly stabbed Brown in the neck and attempted to kill him with a knife.

The teen was charged as an adult, though prosecutors later decided to try him as a juvenile. He was convicted and sentenced to four consecutive life prison terms for his role in the stabbing.

The judge who sentenced the teen, Timothy Maness, called the stabbing ""a sad, tragic event.""

""I hope that you can come to grips with your own feelings and be able to control the emotion that was brought to you by this event,"" Maness said, according to The Associated Press. ""I hope that you can be a productive member of society, not only in the jail but in the community.""

"While most people are focused on the big issues such as the economy and foreign relations, the Redskins were also mentioned as a team that could potentially benefit from the new law.

The Redskins have been a part of the NFL since 1932 and are one of the most recognized franchises in the league. They have won a Super Bowl once, in 1980. The Redskins have a rich history in the NFL and are considered one of the oldest professional sports franchises.

The Redskins have a lot of history, and many fans don't know much about the team or the reason for the name. This article will explain the history of the Redskins. We will also look at the history of the team in the past, and how the team has changed from their beginnings during the early 1900s.

History of the Redskins

The name Redskins was first introduced in 1892 by William Clark who was a coach for the Washington Nationals. The team was named after the mountains that surrounded Washington D.C. and the team was named the Nats after the city's original moniker, the District of Columbia National League.

The Redskins were originally known as the Washington Capital Grays and were a team that played in the National League from 1892 until 1897. During the 1890s, the team was known as the Washington Capitals, which was well known as the team that won the Stanley Cup in 1893. During this time, the team was known as the Capital Grays and they wore the white uniforms with red stripes. The team name was changed to the Washington Capital Grays after the 1895 season, however, the team was still known as the Capitals during this time.

In 1920, the team was moved from Washington D.C. to Chicago and the team was renamed the Chicago Bears. In 1924, the team was moved to St. Louis and the team was renamed the St. Louis Cardinals. During this time, the team was still known as the Capitals.

In 1925, the team moved again and played in Washington D.C., but the team was renamed the Redskins in 1926. During this time, the team was known as the Redskins and they wore the blue uniforms with gold trim.

During the 1930s, the team was called the Redskins, and during this time, the team wore the gray uniforms with white trim. In 1939, the team was renamed the Redskins and the team wore the black uniforms with gold trim. In 1945 the team was renamed the Washington Redskins and the team wore the green uniforms with gold trim.

In 1946 the team was renamed the Redskins and the team wore the green uniforms with gold trim during their first season in the NFL. During this time, the team was known as the Redskins and they wore the green uniforms with gold trim, and the name Redskins was dropped. During this time, the team wore the Washington Redskins name and the team later adopted the Redskins nickname as well.

"After two consecutive years of flat tax revenues, Gov. Scott Walker's administration unveiled a proposal Wednesday that proposes adding sales taxes in 2013 if lawmakers reject his $3.6 billion spending plan in the June 5 budget.

The state currently has no minimum sales tax but has agreed to add one this year.

In addition, the state would have to charge the state's two major credit card companies sales taxes that would start at 0.66 percent and 1.7 percent, depending on the credit card company.

According to a memo sent to state agencies this week, Walker's budget proposal would also include:

•A new $1,000-a-child tax credit to help families pay for college tuition through both private and traditional schools in future.

•A $400-million budget reduction to the University of Wisconsin System.

There were no specific details in either memo, such as the timing or how much the cost of the changes would be. However, Walker's proposed budget also includes cuts to higher education and higher education-related programs that could be included in Walker's proposal.

The budget proposal also includes a proposed $750 million cut to the BadgerCare health insurance program for state employees.

The state Department of Commerce, Economic Development and Trade said its budget cuts will save $40 million, though the state Department of Safety and Professional Services would have $40 million less funding with the elimination of an $10 million budget gap.

For the state Department of Insurance, a proposed $40.5 million loss for 2013 includes losing one of three insurance license districts and losing an $8.4 million budget gap.

There's also a proposed loss for the Wisconsin Association of Counties, a $20 million budget gap, and a $25 million loss for the Office of Rural Health and Assistance.

The Office of Economic Adjustment lost $11.8 million, and the Office of Information Technology and Telecommunications lost $6.8 million.

The budget proposal also would include cuts for two state agencies that deal specifically with poverty: One of the state's three Medicaid commissioners would lose $1.2 million and the other would lose $2.7 million.

Walker has requested spending for $2.8 billion in the current spending plan, which has been approved by a state legislative committee."
"The government's proposed'snooper's charter' will not stop the ""abuse of children"" by paedophiles, a top judge has said.

Judges must ensure the new law will not enable internet providers to make up the law or be used to prevent them carrying out investigations into internet use by children, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd said.

His comments were made in written answers to a parliamentary question which questioned whether the law is proportionate to fight online child abuse.

The bill was drawn up after the Leveson inquiry into press standards.

The Home Office says it gives a statutory obligation on internet providers to co-operate with national child protection authorities.

They must, in England and Wales, investigate suspected offences for children who use websites deemed illegal to view images, and take any necessary steps to protect them.

The bill, including the new offence of possession of child-pornographic material, also allows for a person to be prosecuted at a later date with contempt of court action if they fail to co-operate with the investigation.

However, Lord Justice Thomas said such powers should not be used to silence internet providers.

'Credibility'

""The government seeks to protect children. Its proposed law will do so by ensuring that internet communications services have no excuse for not carrying out investigations when notified - either explicitly or by way of direction - by a national authority concerning a suspected abuse of children committed solely on the internet,"" he said.

""By the same token, however, internet communications services may, in an appropriate case, take the steps which, with reasonable diligence and care, they might take to protect other children or their personal information which they may hold, and they may not be held to be in contempt of court for failing to do so.

""If an internet communications service is given a direction to do something for which it is not equipped to do, it cannot legitimately evade its duty to do so, and may be held in contempt of court for failing to comply.

""The question therefore is not whether internet communications services must comply with the law, but whether the law itself is necessary and proportionate to enable internet communications services to do so.""

The home secretary also indicated that the government was considering changes to the offence of possession of child-pornographic material.

""The home secretary has said that these proposals will not permit internet communication companies to act to suppress lawful conduct,"" Lord Thomas added.

""That position appears to have been affected by two cases where internet communications companies were prosecuted for failing to preserve children's information as required by the law.

""The Home Office will, therefore, consider whether appropriate changes are now available to mitigate against the possibility of prosecution which may result for failing to preserve information about the identity of an identified child."""
"I'm so happy to announce that we finally have the first major game release on the Nexus (we had two in the last 7 days!). Our first big beta update is a massive 64-bit build designed for the latest version of the game, 7.0, and should be the easiest and fastest way to get the game installed. We hope for this to be the baseline release and build upon it to get more and more stable before releasing an alpha. You can download and install the 7.0 beta here and read our full changelog below.

"The most powerful weapon against the Taliban is not to be found in Afghanistan's vast, conflict-torn countryside. It's in the United States Senate.

In November, the Senate voted to curb the CIA's use of drone war. Democrats and Republicans are now negotiating a compromise on the issue.

But the fight to end the CIA's drone war in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen is far from over. The Pentagon's Special Operations Command, the CIA's drone war in Yemen, the CIA's war in Somalia, and the CIA's covert war in Libya will continue.

And the US military has new tools that have yet to be used or fully tested in combat.

Earlier this month, the Pentagon announced that it is developing a new, unmanned aerial vehicle that, if successful, could transform battlefields across the world. In 2007, the United States Army unveiled an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called the Bell 206. The Bell 206 was designed to be cheap, easy to use, and militarily effective.

The Bell 206 was similar to the UAS -- or remotely piloted aircraft -- that the CIA has been using since the mid-1980s. But the Bell 206 was designed for war in conventional combat, not covert operations.

The Bell 206 could be used to drop bombs on the ground, as well as to drop bombs from the sky.

When the Pentagon announced the new drone, it said it would be able to carry a 500-pound bomb. It could also carry out ""targeted strikes"" -- attacks on specific individuals in specific areas of a country where the United States had intelligence that a terrorist activity was taking place.

The new drone could carry a 500-pound bomb.

In a Pentagon press release, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale said the new drone would be used by the U.S. military in ""hot spots"" around the world. The Pentagon said the drone ""could expand U.S. military capabilities to conduct airstrikes in support of U.S. and allied forces in areas other than combat zones.""

But Pentagon officials say that more details about the new drone are expected to be released in coming months.

The Pentagon also announced in November that it would begin testing the new drone in Afghanistan.

As the Bell 206 was intended for conventional battlefields, the Pentagon's new drone is intended for covert operations.

The Pentagon's new drone has several key differences from the Bell 206.

First, it is smaller. The Bell 206, according to the Pentagon, had a wingspan of about 30 feet. The new drone is about the size of a small plane, and it is designed to be smaller than a helicopter. The drone is also designed to be able to carry more equipment, like a Hellfire missile.

Second, the new drone is able to carry weapons. Because the drone is smaller than the Bell 206,"
"A few weeks ago, an idea came to me.  I'm always looking around me and trying to see what's going on, but sometimes I also need to take a break. So here's a short post on a few things that have occurred to me, and what they could mean.  I have no idea whether this is a real game, but I suppose it may be a game.  I'll put a link to a youtube video of one of my favorite songs here, although in an hour or so, it may not fit the format, so if you think it should be posted here… let me know.
The Game…
This past weekend was my wife's first time running a marathon, and her first time doing this sort of thing. The whole thing was pretty epic.  The course was fun to run, the food was good, and… I was having a good time.  I was able to finish first in my age group and the women's division as well.  The entire race was fantastic. I ran about 6:00 hours at a decent pace, ran some nice hills, did some easy running (which, to be honest, is all I run most of the time anyways), and just had a lot of fun, not only on race day but also since.
There was one incident that I witnessed that I thought was pretty funny after the race.  In the parking lot of the race's start/finish, there was a semi-circle of people waiting to get into the parking lot near the finish.  I guess the only real reason to have a line that long is to make sure that only really qualified runners enter.  When we saw the line, I figured that the event staff was about to start letting in more runners once the crowds reached an acceptable level, but then it looked like something very different.  One of the last runners in line seemed like he wasn't going to make the cut.  He had obviously gotten beat out by the rest of the people already in the line.  He just stood there, with a look of pure misery on his face.
I think it's safe to say that the man had been beat.  He wasn't even looking at the end of the line in search of his medal.  He was in there with his head down and a look of complete and utter dismay across his face.  He had to have known that he was done.  He was a pretty long way from doing much at all.  He was probably looking at the end of the race and thinking, 'Man, I really wish I had done one more lap…'
When I finally heard what he was saying, I was shocked to find that he was saying something along the lines of 'Don't you guys want me to help them…?'   I could only smile back at him because I had no idea what he was talking about and was completely confused by the whole exchange."
"When California voters rejected a proposed $52-per-hour minimum wage in November, it was the largest statewide defeat for a state-based minimum wage increase in nearly two decades. But the state's minimum wage isn't the only place where wage workers are struggling.

A new report from the National Employment Law Project, ""The State of Working America 2014,"" found that the wages of nearly 60 percent of the nation's private-sector workers are less than $15 per hour. Overall, the report found that 48 percent of workers were paid less than $12 per hour in 2013.

The report found that nearly two-thirds of public-sector workers were paid less than $12 per hour, compared with only 10 percent of private-sector workers.

Many of the lowest-paid private-sector workers are not technically minimum wage workers, but contractors who are not entitled to certain federal worker protections. The report finds that, in 2013, a record 93 percent of private-sector workers were employed by contractors who are not covered by any federal wage, overtime, or employment protections.

The report also found that the federal minimum wage has not kept pace with inflation. The minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, but adjusted for inflation it is worth less than it was in 1968.

The report is based off of the findings of the annual National Employment Law Project report, ""The State of Working America,"" but has some additional analysis.

The report found that ""states with the highest levels of private-sector wage inequality, such as North Carolina, Massachusetts and New York, have a larger share of their workforce engaged in low-wage work than states with a more equal distribution of jobs with low-wage workers.""

The report also found that the lowest-paid workers are concentrated in the retail sector, where they make up ""over half of the workforce in the fast food industry and more than half of workers employed in the retail sector.""

The report also found that the lowest-paid workers in the retail sector are earning an average of $9.67 per hour, compared to an average of $12.14 per hour for workers in the service sector.

The report also found that while low-wage workers are concentrated in the retail sector, the rest of the country has a higher concentration of low-wage workers in the service sector.

The report found that more than half of low-wage workers are employed in health care and social assistance. While the report did not look at full-time workers, it found that the wage gap between higher- and lower-paid workers for full-time employees was only $1 an hour, compared to $6.25 for part-time workers."
"NEW YORK - A New York man was sentenced to more than eight years in prison for defrauding the Social Security Administration out of more than $200,000 by using a false identity.

Bernard Yomtov, 41, of Brooklyn, pleaded guilty to a single count of Social Security identity theft, a Class D felony, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Wednesday.

Yomtov was arrested in April 2016 after federal agents caught him using a false identity at the Brooklyn Brooklyn Federal Courthouse, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said.

According to the indictment, in 2014, Yomtov used a false Social Security number to get a job at the Brooklyn Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where he earned $90,000 a year.

However, Yomtov was actually using a Social Security number that belonged to a woman who had previously been arrested on a domestic violence charge, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

The woman's brother-in-law contacted prosecutors in 2015 after he discovered that his sister-in-law was using Yomtov's Social Security number and that he had since been arrested on domestic abuse charges.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Yomtov kept close tabs on his sister-in-law and had monitored her movements. She was arrested on the domestic abuse charge in February 2016, and Yomtov used her Social Security number and a fake name to obtain a job with the Brooklyn Veterans Affairs Medical Center, prosecutors said.

A court filing from Yomtov's attorney said Yomtov ""was not actually the person who submitted the form to the Social Security Administration. However, he was the one who signed it.""

Yomtov pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay $192,814 in restitution to the Social Security Administration.

"It's the second week of the 2015-16 NHL season and a lot is happening around the league.

What's happening in the NHL right now is happening in every major North American professional sports league. A lot of things are happening at the same time throughout the league. It's a lot to manage, and that's why the NHL is one of the most expensive leagues to be an owner of a hockey team within.

There are plenty of factors at play when it involves the salary cap, expansion teams and other factors, but the league's inability to properly develop and manage an NHL franchise is probably the most impactful one.

To understand where the NHL's franchise valuation is, let's start by understanding the size of its salary cap.

In 2012-13, the NHL started taking a calculated risk by setting the cap at $64 million. That was $2.8 million less than the previous year and $16 million less than at this point in both 2011-12 and 2010-11. The league's previous rule was to always have the highest cap hit at $71.4 million, and it's been there ever since its inception.

This year's salary cap ceiling is projected to hit somewhere between $71.4 and $73.1 million.

As I wrote last week, it's important to understand how the salary cap works on a year-to-year basis. It's a complicated system.

Let's try to breakdown one potential scenario and break down what happens and why in each case.

First, the salary cap will likely be between $73.1 million and $74 million this season because we're looking ahead at the 2016-17 NHL season.

So that means that the league has enough money to sign at least 10 players this season, with eight guaranteed to be NHL-level contract players and four other players guaranteed to get a minimum qualifying offer that can push their compensation up to the next level.

It's important to emphasize that the qualifying offer is just that: It is, in effect, a one-year deal. It is not a longer contract that allows the team to get two years out of a player from the team making the offer.

The offer would be the one-year guarantee only if the player plays a minimum of 40 NHL games during the duration of the offer.

That means, for instance, if a contract is signed that would allow a player at the NHL level who is 35 years of age or younger to make just over $1.13 million in 2016-17, there isn't much room there for additional compensation beyond the qualifying offer and the overall salary cap.

There is a small bit of room for a team or a player to get one more year out of a player or contract. There are still teams and players who would qualify as high-salary players, because the salary cap doesn't go up to"

The Battle of Endor involved the capture of the Death Star, an Imperial-class battle station equipped with the superlaser. The battle began after an invasion of the planet Alderaan, which became embroiled in a political crisis. An invasion squad under Leia Organa's father, Ben Solo, infiltrated the facility and fought their way through the defense system in an attempt to reach the superlaser weapon. The invasion was successful, and the Death Star was subsequently destroyed. During the battle, both Darth Vader and Darth Sidious, the main leaders of the Galactic Empire, were killed. However, the battle was a strategic failure as the Death Star was destroyed in the battle's aftermath and the Empire lost their ultimate advantage over the Rebel Alliance. The invasion force was largely destroyed, as were most of the Alderaanians who participated, and the planet was left in ruins without a functioning Death Star. Following the battle, the Organa family relocated back to Alderaan, and the Galactic Senate began a war against the Alliance, with Senator Leia Organa personally leading a rebel force.

""As our friends have always reminded us, we must fight for the future.""

""For our children, our parents, and for our planet."" ―Carnor Jax and Leia Organa, upon the attack of Alderaan [src]

The Rebellion was the cause of much turmoil in the galaxy beginning in 3 ABY (4 ABY), with a number of minor incidents and incidents such as the attack of the planet Alderaan, in an effort to force the Empire to end their occupation of the planet and its population. Although the planet was not yet under Imperial control, several groups of rebellious Alderaanians had taken up arms against the Empire, including the Alliance to Restore the Republic and a group of Imperial defectors. In 5 ABY, the Empire made an attempted raid against the planet, but their efforts were interrupted when the planet's Rebel leadership attempted to negotiate with Rebel leaders, including General Han Solo, Han and Leia Organa aboard the Millennium Falcon.

During this time, Leia Organa, a Rebel pilot with Luke Skywalker on her wing, was a member of the Alderaan Resistance, an elite fighting force made up of Alderaanian pilots in order to protect the homeworld from the Imperial Fleet. During the mission, several Rebel leaders were killed by the Death Star. A battle soon broke out in Alderaan between Imperial forces, including Commander Gilad Pellaeon and Darth Vader on board the dread"
"""My name is A-Rod, the new baseball star, and I am the new Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to hit a home run in the major leagues.""

Those were the opening words of a new interview with A-Rod, posted at the website www.baseballreporters.com by The Players' Tribune writer Ryan Lavarnway.

And it is a great job of opening, as the transcript was so short that you have to read it twice to remember what it is about. (Or, you can just read the first page.)

Advertisement

Lavarnway then asks him a question in about three sentences, and then the whole thing is summarized in a couple of more questions. He starts by speaking briefly about how ""it feels"" and how his ""story is still kind of under wraps"" — he doesn't say ""what it is about."" He also speaks of growing up in the ""hood"" in Compton and being ""so proud"" to be the new ""Jackie.""

""I'm proud because this is an important story for young people,"" he says. And then he says: ""I know you guys are probably all excited about this. My name is A-Rod, the new baseball star, and I am the new Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to hit a home run in the major leagues.""

When he says his story is still ""kind of under wraps,"" this means that the interview was conducted for a ""top story"" in a magazine called the Players' Tribune, which has been publishing a regular collection of quotes and stories about baseball's players for more than a decade. They are, of course, mostly players the writers had written about in the past: Hall of Fame players such as Derek Jeter and Mike Trout; recent greats such as Bryce Harper; and just the usual names along the roster, like Chris Davis and Alex Rodriguez. (The magazine's coverage is a bit more personal than that of SI or Outside the Lines, which the Tribune started doing in 2014; they are also limited: It runs in three issues a year, with a total run time of about 15-20 pages.)

The only person who was at the end of the interview when A-Rod said ""first African-American to hit"" the home run was Lavarnway; he was the sole witness on the recording.

But it is not a bad read in general. A-Rod speaks well; not a lot of the quotes are his own, and the stories are generally true to life. At least they are as close to true as I have ever had a secondhand glimpse of the player's thoughts, thoughts I have read about many times in other media sources — this is something he said to Lavarnway for him to quote in the SI story. ""What is going through my mind?"" is an easy enough question to answer in"
"How do people get their news?

Whether you're a news consumer or a news producer, you want to know what's out there. And it's not always easy.

Every network, cable news channel, and newspaper is trying to reach you with the latest news.

But there's so much news out there, it's hard to know where to start.

You might have a few trusted sources, but you probably don't know everything about the news.

So, how do you find out what's out there?

Here are five ways to find out what's out there.

1. Read the headlines

There's a lot of news out there, so it's important to know what's important. Read the headlines to see what's happening across the country.

2. Watch the news

The news is always new. So, it's important to stay on top of the biggest stories. Watch the news to see which stories are driving the news.

3. Browse the web

There are always new stories going on in the world. So, it's important to find the original stories on the web.

4. Read magazines

"You don't have to be a programmer to write an app but you do have to know a thing or two about programming. The following is a simple example app and this kind of app shouldn't take long to create. We will be going over each part of the solution step by step in a follow up article which will cover the details of how to download app components in Google Play and how to integrate each component from the store.

I'm using Swift for the example app, the same goes for any other language.

Setup

Add a new folder called'swift' into your project

IntelliJ

Go to File > New > File

Add a new Swift file (we will be going over this next step)

Project Structure

The Project Structure is a little bit different from normal Swift Apps as it contains an App Module, which is the main entry point to creating components. This folder structure will be repeated for each of the app components (so you have multiple components in the same folder) which will be used in our app. A component is just a template which you will see the code of in the build file.

To get started, lets start with app.xcworkspace as it is the base project structure and the foundation of our app. All of the app components are going to work in this project.

First we make sure to set up our app to be used by IntelliJ IDEA. We import some packages that will be used by our components.

We then export our components to get the components we need in our project.

Next up is App Module which we will build from the first step and the components we will use in our app.

Build and Run!

To build and run the app, click Run > Build Solution. The result will look similar to this:

If you try to run the app now, you will see the following error:

Components not found in path (Xcode doesn't know where they are) in project 'Xcode5.0.1/Projects/IntelliJ/Swift/Swift/Main'

This is normal, we have imported the correct package and compiler flags are being used so nothing is missing. If however you try to run app.xcworkspace and run the main function inside the App Module, a simple error message will be displayed:

Unable to run main module in Xcode5.0.1:'main'

This is because the main module (the one that we were using earlier) is not being executed in the context of the app (remember above what a project is?). This is how you know you are running a project with the wrong compiler flags.

Luckily that is pretty easy to fix as we can add in the right compiler flags manually using the Project Structure tab in Xcode.

"BARRY, Utah — A former University of Utah student accused of sexually assaulting two women while on campus has been assaulted by his older brother.

Spencer C. Hines, 23, was arrested in October and charged with two counts of first-degree felony sexual assault.

According to a press release from the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office, the sexual assault happened Oct. 4, when Hines was 18, and occurred in a campus dorm room.

Hines was released from jail following his arrest, but the judge ordered him to stay away from his sister, who he is accused of threatening.

Hines' older brother, Cody Hines, 24, was arrested and booked into the Salt Lake County Jail on Saturday. He was released from custody on Sunday, and also ordered not to contact his sister, his attorneys said.

Cody Hines has since bonded out of jail.

Cody Hines told police that he had sex with his sister on multiple occasions, according to the press release.

Hines is scheduled to appear in court on April 18."
"The only major party candidate still promising to repeal Obamacare has to walk back something of her health care stance.

Hillary Clinton said that she is not going to be able to put ""reinsurance"" or any similar kind of government-run healthcare program into her presidential campaign platform when asked by ABC News on Thursday if she would be willing to ""tweak"" her plan to make it more palatable to Democratic primary voters.

""As of today, again, no, I'm not going to put anything in,"" said Clinton. ""If I do that, then it's a Trojan horse, and as Donald is well aware – there's no way to control the government. So I wouldn't do that … I think that it is too soon to have anything like that in your platform. At least until the Congressional committees look at it.""

Clinton made similar comments in a conversation with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos at a Women for Hillary breakfast a month ago. During that phone call, Clinton also called her proposed plan to ""protect and expand"" a government-run marketplace for health insurance akin to Obamacare a ""public option."" But her statement to ABC News Thursday indicated that her position on public insurance plans is not static.

""I would say not tomorrow,"" said Clinton. ""Not the next day, because I think, as I said on the phone call, we really need to look at how we're going to get costs down, how we're going to take risk out of the system, but for right now I'm not ready to have something like that in my program."" This would exclude her proposed Obamacare replacement proposal, which Clinton has said would include ""reinsurance"" provisions to help small and low income Americans afford coverage.

At the first Democratic primary debate last month, Clinton said that she believed she would be able to make changes to her signature health care accomplishment: Obamacare. ""What I will say is that if Congress and the president and others want to work with us on a more comprehensive plan, and they've got some ideas, I am fully open-minded about those ideas and I've been open to a lot of them over the last 15 years. And we've got to decide if we're going to make the kind of progress that makes sure the middle class knows they have something to look forward to,"" Clinton said."
"SINGAPORE - The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) announced on Monday (Oct 31) that it will transfer its ageing fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons from the depot to the air force, with the first plane to be flown in 2019.

The first plane to be exported will be the second batch of 16 F-16s to be overhauled by the US, which will be put to use in the US-led Africa Command.

The first batch of 16 F-16s, which will be replaced by the F-16 Block 50 aircraft, will be sold to the US in the next few years.

The first aircraft, which will be sold to the US, is currently undergoing refurbishment at the US's Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The refurbishment is expected to be completed in 2018.

Singapore's Air Force will decide whether to purchase the second batch of 16 F-16s in the next few years, once it is finalised.

The first batch of 16 F-16s is being overhauled by Lockheed Martin at its service base in Fort Worth, Texas. The refurbishment program is expected to be completed in 2019.

Currently, the Singapore Air Force (SAF) has F-16s equipped with the RQ-4 Global Hawk (Hawk Beechcraft) and the RQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft.

The first batch of 16 F-16s will be replaced by the F-16 Block 50, which is more advanced in terms of weapon delivery, avionics, sensors and stealth technology.

The Singapore Air Force (SAF) has been upgrading its fleet of F-16s for the past four decades. The country currently operates 87 F-16s, with a total of 50 aircraft in service.

The new batch of 16 F-16s being transferred to the air force will be used primarily for training purposes.

The first batch of 16 F-16s was ordered in 1985.

A total of 1,916 aircraft were ordered by Singapore in total, with the first batch of 16 F-16s being delivered to the fledgling air force in 1985.

The first batch of 16 F-16s was replaced by the F-16 Block 50."
"We're continuing our look at the top 100 big-name free agents of this summer and this week we're looking at free agency for the first time. Today we're looking at an intriguing situation.

In the past, the Broncos have been known for their prolific offensive line play. This past year was no different. The Broncos had the second-best offensive line in the NFL, featuring 285-plus snaps on the right side and the second-best offensive line in the NFL, featuring 279-plus snaps on the left side.

With the Broncos' offensive line playing so well, why would the team need to re-sign any of its offensive linemen?

For starters, the Broncos are counting on left guard Louis Vasquez to be the team's starting right guard next year. He's the only Broncos offensive lineman who was a starter last year - and the only one who started all 16 games.

Vasquez is entering the final year of his contract and will be a high-priced free agent this offseason.

The Broncos have no plans to re-sign Vasquez to a multi-year deal, and his agent is working on a one-year deal that will pay him significantly less than the multi-year deal that the Broncos are counting on him to sign in the future.

That's why the Broncos are looking at defensive linemen.

This past season, the Broncos gave up the fewest sacks (14) in the NFL. The Broncos have a number of young defensive linemen who could be key contributors in 2015.

Here's a list of some of the Broncos' defensive linemen:

DE Derek Wolfe: Wolfe had six sacks, 18 tackles for loss, and six quarterback pressures in 16 starts. He was named first-team All-Pro by The Associated Press and The Sporting News.

"The first of three stories from the Ars Technica archives, ""Was the iPhone 4 a Phone Cracked by NSA?"" explores the NSA's ability to break into the iPhone 4's cellular communications using a tool called ""GSMjailbreak.""

GSMjailbreak is a tool that allows the NSA to ""rewire"" the iPhone 4's key system, so that it can communicate with the government's enormous SIGINT network without the phone being tapped, according to the NSA's own website.

The NSA's own technical specifications for GSMjailbreak call it ""the largest and most important intelligence collection program of the NSA."" The tool has been used by the NSA to ""crack"" the iPhone's encryption, according to the article.

""I was surprised to see that the NSA was able to take a phone and use it as a phone, and was able to use it as a phone to communicate with people,"" said James Bamford, author of the book ""The Shadow Factory.""

Bamford has written extensively about the NSA's surveillance programs and the role of Edward Snowden.

""I find it amazing that this is even a question,"" said Bamford, who has visited the NSA's headquarters in Fort Meade, Md., and interviewed Snowden. ""It's pretty obvious that all the information that comes over the network is being collected, and the NSA is able to break it.""

Bamford said he has been told by an NSA source that the tool is ""extremely powerful,"" and has tested it against the iPhone 4.

""It works on the iPhone 4,"" Bamford said. ""It works against the iPhone 4.""

The NSA declined to comment on the story.

The NSA relies on a group of partner organizations to assist in its surveillance efforts, according to the agency's website. The NSA does not reveal the names of these partner organizations, but Bamford said he knows that they are the British intelligence agency GCHQ and the Australian Signals Directorate, which is part of the Australian Signals Directorate.

In one of the more dramatic revelations in ""The Shadow Factory,"" Bamford wrote that the NSA had been able to recover the location of a target after tapping into the communications of a target.

Bamford said the NSA has been able to capture the location of a target because the target makes a regular location-based telephone call to a government official. The NSA can then determine the location of the target by the originating and terminating phone numbers.

""If the target phones somebody, the NSA will know the originating and terminating phone numbers, and will know the destination,"" Bamford said. ""That is a lot of information.""

Bamford said he has been told by current and former intelligence officials that the NSA's surveillance programs are ""completely nuts"" and that many of the claims being made in the media are overblown.

"LONDON – The Israeli government on Thursday confirmed the discovery of a body that was found in a pipe at a West Bank settlement, the first such discovery in the area in years, and said it was investigating the circumstances of the death.

The body was found in a plastic box in a pit in the town of Qusra, near the settlement of Kfar Adumim, a ministry spokesman said. The spokesman added that the discovery was being treated as suspicious.

The discovery followed the discovery last month of the remains of three Israeli teens in the area.

The Israeli military said that since 2005 it had discovered remains of 34 Palestinians in the West Bank region, including in Qusra.

The remains of the boys were discovered on June 30, provoking a massive manhunt that left dozens of Palestinians dead and hundreds wounded. They were all believed to have been killed in fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinians.

The discovery of the body in Qusra on Thursday came hours after an Israeli army officer was killed by Palestinian gunmen in the northern West Bank and several other Israeli soldiers were wounded in attacks.

A spokesman for the state-run Israel Radio said the body of the Palestinian man was found in a pipe in the street and was transported to the Israeli military's Judea and Samaria forensic institute in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah.

The spokesman said the man's identity was being verified.

The Palestinian health ministry said that the body of a Palestinian man was found in a pipe at a West Bank settlement on Wednesday.

Majdi Abu Ismail, a medical official in the Palestinian Authority health ministry, said the body was that of a male.

He said the man was found in the West Bank city of al-Ram, south of Ramallah.

Abu Ismail said the man had been shot and killed.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing, but the Palestinian Hamas group, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks on Israeli soldiers.

The Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas militants in the past and that there were no differences between the two sides in the current violence.

""We are still working to establish the circumstances surrounding this incident,"" the military said.

"""Carrying On"" is the nineteenth episode of the third season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and is the fifty-second episode altogether. It was written by Joss Whedon and directed by David Solomon. It originally broadcast on March 30, 2001.

Buffy finds herself in a battle with the Watcher's Council and, through her own efforts, learns to put her demons behind her.

Contents show]

Synopsis

An uneasy alliance between Angel and Spike begins. But it isn't long before Buffy finds herself in a much heavier struggle, with both sides trying to use her as a pawn in their own battles.

Plot

While sleeping on an air mattress in a room at the library, Twilight talks with Buffy about her recent life: her relationship with Angel, the Scooby Gang's involvement in an exorcism that killed two demons, and her experience at Sunnydale High School. Buffy is surprised to hear Twilight talk about the exorcism, as she is convinced that Angel was responsible for the death. Buffy's mother, Joyce, enters the room, telling Buffy that she should rest, as she has been sleeping too much lately. Buffy tells her not to be worried by the noise, and Joyce states that Xander, who is her boyfriend, is also sleeping next to her, suggesting Buffy is in the habit of sleeping with all six of the Scoobies. In actuality, she is sleeping with her own boyfriend: Spike, who is sitting on top of a bed next to her.

Joyce informs Spike that she just wants to ""bother him for a while"" in bed. Spike responds that he cannot say no to his girlfriend when she asks him for intimacy, but that if it is not for her he would prefer to be alone. He tells her that the Scoobies had planned to have a party at their house but canceled after Joyce and Buffy's relationship began to worsen, which infuriates Joyce. Spike mentions that she ""gave him the slip"" and they both start to get angry. She is about to slap him when he interrupts, stating that Buffy has called him. Joyce tells her to shut up before she knocks her own hand over Buffy's.

The Scoobies visit the Summers' house to celebrate Buffy's birthday. While trying to celebrate, Spike is interrupted by Spike's mother, who calls him ""Pops,"" but not before he gives her a kiss.

Buffy is preparing chocolate chip cookies in the kitchen for everyone when Joyce enters, stating that Buffy must be at the library, stating that she was supposed to help with lunch. The other Scoobies get up from the table and begin making more cookies, but Joyce insists they wait until late at night before preparing again. When she goes to the window for a second to look outside again, she sees Spike and Buffy engaged in an intense sexual embrace and is angry. She angrily walks away, saying that she won't"
"PURPOSE:

The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of subjects' psychological stress and sleep deprivation on memory performance in a memory-related task.

METHODS:

Thirty-five healthy male subjects (mean ± SEM age: 28.9 ± 1.4 years, range 18-45 years) participated in a cued-recall-learning task. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a group that received a nap prior to the task (nap group) or a control group (no nap group). Subjects performed the memory task on three separate occasions. The study lasted for 48 hours. Results are presented as mean ± SD.

RESULTS:

The nap group performed significantly better than the control group on the subsequent memory test. The nap group also performed significantly better on the subsequent test of verbal fluency than the control group, providing evidence that sleep deprivation can improve verbal memory performance.

CONCLUSIONS:

The nap group performed better on the subsequent memory test than the control group. The nap group performed better on the subsequent test of verbal fluency than the control group, providing evidence that sleep deprivation can improve verbal memory performance."

"A new batch of emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private server were released Tuesday.

CNN reported on the emails and the fact that they were recovered from Clinton's home server by the FBI.

The new batch includes the exchange Clinton had with longtime confidante Sidney Blumenthal about a controversial U.S. decision to attack a convoy of Libyan soldiers during the war.

In that October 2014 email, Blumenthal, who previously worked as a senior advisor to Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton, said the attacks and deaths proved that the administration should not have gone in.

Clinton responded by saying ""the decision was made to have the U.S. military to protect the convoy.""

The Associated Press reported later in the month, when the attack occurred, that U.S. ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens' death was an ""insider attack"" that occurred as a result of ""malfunction.""

She also responded to Blumenthal's email by saying ""so many emails about wjc (Bill Clinton) and his work on policy.""

She continued, ""So much to do. What he does, gets attacked, comes back stronger.""

But she did not respond in a comment with the email to say that he could not possibly work as a top aide, given the circumstances and the way in which she worked with him.

The emails were released in response to lawsuits filed on the part of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch. Judicial Watch also asked a federal court last month for the return of all Clinton's emails.

Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, also received an email from Blumenthal in response to a March 11, 2012 email where Blumenthal wrote a letter to Congress saying a U.S. military operation in Libya had ""clearly gone awry."" Blumenthal wrote the letter after news that an unarmed British diplomat, Chris Stevens, had been seized and murdered. Clinton said she had not received the letter from Blumenthal despite it being sent the day that she received the email from Blumenthal.

According to CNN, the U.S. military operation had never explicitly declared Stevens the target and had targeted the convoy rather than the mission. The attack left at least one member of the convoy dead, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, and a U.S. Foreign Service officer was killed when the consulate was set on fire. Two contractors were killed in their facility."
"The United States has a very, very old law. For more than 200 years, the First Amendment has prohibited the state from depriving a person of ""equal protection of the laws."" It is no small irony - indeed an outrage - that this is so often forgotten.

In the United States, the principle of equality under law was established by three Supreme Court Cases, each of them a victory for equal rights.

One of the most important of those cases was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. One of the leading authorities on the case was Harvard professor James Farmer, who wrote the following, in his landmark 1937 history, ""Race Relations in the United States, 1877-1947"":

""Our law as to all citizens, irrespective of race, color, or creed, is simple. It has been so ever since the adoption of the Constitution of the united states. It is contained in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the united states. If there be any thing to be said for the proposition that one race of people is not, in the special relations between the citizen and the government of the country, to be favored with a preferential system of laws, than there can be no justification, in that sense, for disregarding the provisions of our Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment. We are not saying that any particular national, religious, economic, or racial group is unqualified to enjoy any or all the rights and privileges conferred by our Constitution upon the people. On the contrary, the same rights are equally available to all races.""

After the Supreme Court ruled on segregation in the public schools in Brown v. Board of Education, the public sentiment swung toward African Americans. As it happened, the South was not exactly a bastion of support for the right to segregate the schools. But the state of Mississippi was. ""We can't afford to lose the blacks, the black vote,"" a senator said at the time. So Mississippi passed a law in 1955 banning whites from using public facilities to enroll black children. And so, in 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down that restriction. Justice Hugo Black wrote, ""There is no need to fear that by making our segregation laws applicable to Negroes and to Caucasians alike, we will thereby make them applicable to all of the races, but merely to those portions of the races which happen to be in the majority at the present time.""

So, even in 1963, there was the sentiment that whites and races should not be allowed separate access to public facilities. But in 1964, one of the landmark decisions, Loving v. Virginia, made explicit the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Justice Harlan Stone wrote:

""We have before us a problem of federalism, of the ability of the States and their citizens to preserve as they deem best the scheme of segregation that their own forebears had ordained, and without fear of interference by the United"

A suicide bomber has blown himself up at a military base in North Sinai, killing at least five soldiers and injuring at least 10, security and medical sources say.

The attacker was wearing explosive trousers, the security sources said.

The explosion happened near the entrance to the base in Sheikh Zuweid, the sources added, suggesting the attack may have been an attempt to reach the interior ministry.

The army has been battling militants in the region.

In a statement, the military said it had ""neutralised"" the attacker with a booby-trapped vehicle while he was trying to reach the interior ministry.

The blast comes after President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered a major crackdown on militant groups in Sinai that he has called the most serious threat to national security.

Since then, at least 16 people have been killed in the streets of North Sinai, the areas where most of the violence has been focused.

The latest attack focused on a military base, and the sources said the bomber had been able to enter the base by driving a car into one of the gates, which had been reinforced with metal bars.

The sources added that some people had been killed and some more severely injured. One soldier was said to have been killed and two seriously wounded.

The sources said the bomber had been wearing explosive vests, suggesting he may have been trying to reach the interior ministry.

According to the UN, at least 700 people have been killed in violence in Sinai since June.

A relative of one of the victims told the BBC the attack had caught many off guard.

""We were at home,"" he said, ""and we heard the news and rushed to the hospital.

""We saw two wounded men, a soldier and a policeman. They were both dead.""

The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Cairo says the army has been reluctant to use force in the Sinai, but now appears to be looking to do so.

Since the beginning of 2015, the army has been carrying out operations in Sinai to root out militants, who are thought to have ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's oldest Islamist group.

"PATNA: After months of protests, the NDA government on Wednesday cleared the Maharashtra Bill for the protection of women from domestic violence. The Bill was adopted by the state legislative assembly under the chairmanship of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had made this demand in the recent Budget Session of the state assembly.The ordinance was introduced in the assembly on Wednesday morning and won the confidence of all the members. The Bill has been adopted by the assembly in its current form. The CM had taken up this issue first in the Budget Session of the assembly in February.Fadnavis had said that the Bill was needed to protect women from domestic violence, ""and if the government had not taken up this issue in the budget session, we would not have had this Bill now"".The Bill, which is likely to be tabled in the state assembly in the coming session, seeks to define domestic violence, provides for protection to women, provides for the arrest of culprits in cases of domestic violence, criminalises false allegations of domestic violence and provides for fine for the nuisance caused by such cases.Fadnavis had said that the Bill would not only help women but also help the society at large. ""It is a step that helps the society. This Bill would help women,"" he had said.The main opposition in the assembly was from the BJP, which had moved an amendment in the Bill to include a section on rape and sex ratio. The BJP claimed that the amendment did not go along with the spirit of the Bill.Fadnavis had in February sought an ordinance to be tabled in the state assembly to deal with the menace of domestic violence, saying the state government had not been able to deal with it due to the absence of a law. He had said that if the ordinance was not tabled, he would move a private member's bill that will deal with the matter."
"""You see, you've got the whole world at your fingertips!"" – Aisha Tyler

Aisha is the newest member of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and she will be the most intriguing, engaging, and entertaining member of the house. We first noticed Aisha and her personality after she began introducing herself as the ""Queen of the World"" to the women around her. After making friends effortlessly, she quickly and politely asked everyone to refer to her as ""the Queen.""

Although many of the women on the cast are talented businesswomen, socialites, and actresses, they are not the biggest fan of Aisha's new title. While many were genuinely surprised, it was also interesting to see that, along with the aforementioned names – it has also been adopted by a few of the older women, and even some men in the cast.

The world Aisha describes sounds like it's perfect. We've got supermodels, rock stars, supermodels, supermodels, supermodels, supermodels, and yet it's also so much more than that. This is a woman who will take the world we know and put it on its most beautiful, glamorous, and most dangerous place. Her latest project, the documentary The Queen of Versailles, was directed by her friend, cinematographer and producer Robert Elswit. If there was ever a project that showcased her talents and skill, it's surely this one. She's been given incredible access, giving the world an inside look of the lives of the women for whom she is the creative force of creation and direction.

Aisha is clearly someone with a tremendous eye for detail, and the final product is sure to have the fans of RHOBH buzzing. Not only is Aisha incredibly talented, but she certainly has a sense of humor; a quality we wish our own Real Housewives could have. What we don't agree with is her love for fashion so much to the point that our hearts stop and we don't even dare turn on the television. She is not the first Real Housewives to be caught wearing the wrong dress and hair for any given event, but you have to wonder, how will the girls react when she joins them and starts wearing their outfits?

As we've already learned, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills is no joke. There is no shortage of drama, and drama always makes the reality TV stars on this show even more captivating than before. From the drama of the women they are fighting over in their homes, to the crazy drama in the men's lives, the Housewives have an equal ability to put their best foot forward and get their drama on. Aisha's new project, as well as her role as ""Queen of Versailles"" is sure to be just the thing to keep things going. Let's wait and see how she handles the pressure."
"Kurdish-led forces have captured several villages in the north-west of the country as well as a border crossing from Islamic State, the military said on Friday.

""Kurdish security authorities have taken control of the villages of Kalar, Tal-Shilat, Bizim al-Aman and Shairah in the Syrian province of Afrin,"" it added.

A statement said the militants were ""fleeing"" the villages after US air strikes destroyed their tank position.

The town of Azaz was also seized by Kurdish forces, the statement said.

A US-led coalition has conducted almost a dozen airstrikes against IS positions in the northern and eastern parts of Syria. At least 14 civilians were also killed in the attacks, US Central Command said in a statement on Thursday.

The United Nations said in a report on Thursday that at least 2,000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began.

Since the beginning of the conflict, more than 215,000 people have been killed, according to United Nations.

More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the conflict erupted in March 2011."
"The best thing about watching football can be the team you root for.

And after watching the New York Giants on Sunday, no group is better than the Giants as a collection of diverse athletes united by their underdog status.

The Giants are the underdog, but not just in the sense that they'll be outgunned by the Pittsburgh Steelers or that they'll beat a better team than they do -- they will win this game.

As the ""Gang of 5"" prepare to take on their rivals in the Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium, they have to play their game of being the underdog without the burden of expectations of not doing well enough to win.

""We're the underdogs, period,"" linebacker J.T. Thomas said before the game. And there is no doubt how good this group wants to play.

Even if nobody else remembers it, I did. I always think of the 2012 Super Bowl between the Giants and Ben Roethlisberger's Steelers. A little bit like that, the Giants are not a favorite for the Super Bowl with the Steelers. But the Giants had to win this game when they didn't have to and they did.

Sunday marked the fifth time this season that the Giants got off to an excellent start -- even if they are the last one left standing after the NFC's first four playoff spots were doled out.

In 2012, Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. set the tone with a thrilling 30-23 victory over the Steelers at Heinz Field. In Week 2, the Giants made it look easy when they beat the Cowboys 33-10 at home. But Sunday's win was better. The Giants didn't have to score touchdowns, don't make as many mistakes and play well down the stretch to win.

Sunday was a win with a playoff-like feel. The Giants' defense had some big plays -- the defensive line and linebackers especially -- and that's what the team looks like in the final three minutes. And the offensive performances were just as impressive.

There were moments when the Giants made you look like you couldn't believe they were up by 10 points early in the fourth quarter, but they also kept it close.

Here's how, by the way.

• Running back Rashad Jennings had seven carries for 76 yards. That's the second-most yards in a loss in the history of the NFL.

• Beckham had six catches for 78 yards. That's more catches than he had receiving touchdowns in four games this season.

• On the second defensive snap of the game, cornerback Janoris Jenkins intercepted a pass and returned it 28 yards to help the game's two touchdowns: Eli Manning's first scoring pass and the Giants' last score.

• Linebackers J.T. Thomas and Devon Kennard had sacks against the Steelers with the play coming on a fourth-down sack that should have been"

"Why do we need to spend money on public transport? It's the question that has been plaguing British politicians for the past decade.

This year has seen a number of measures proposed to raise money for the railways, the NHS, and local councils. Most were part of the government's ""Tory manifesto"" for the last election.

But some of these ideas are even more ambitious than the Tories' manifesto.

The government is planning to spend £5bn on the Crossrail project, which would build a new railway line through London from west to east.

This was the first time the government had planned to build a new line since the opening of the London Underground in 1954. It could make huge changes to the way we move around the capital.

Crossrail is being built by an experienced team of experts, including architects, engineers, and construction bosses who have worked on major infrastructure projects in the US. It's the kind of project that would have been described as ""transformational"".

But it's looking like the government won't be able to deliver on its ambitious plans.

There are some big hurdles to overcome.

In order to make the project viable, the government needs to convince the public that it will be worth the money.

The latest estimates from the government's public finances department say that it needs a further £24bn to pay for Crossrail. That's an average of £1.6bn per year, which is higher than the £900m it was thought it would require to pay for the HS2 HS2 high speed rail line, which is the second biggest transport project in the UK and was supposed to be completed by 2026.

The government also has to convince the governor of the Bank of England that the project is worth the money, and that it will be profitable over the long term as it expands the London economy.

It's also going to need to convince the City of London that the project is worth its investment.

The crossrail project is going to be a major economic driver, if it's going to be completed on time and on budget.

But the government's plans to raise cash for the project have caused a lot of controversy.

Most of the money raised will come from the proceeds of tax on land and buildings to fund the project.

This is controversial because the land and buildings used to build the line will be owned by the government.

The government argues that the proceeds from this tax will help fund a new rail line, but there are a number of MPs who believe this is not a fair transaction.

It's also unclear whether the government will be able to sell the land it's using to build the new line to the private sector.

This is because the government is asking shareholders to give up a percentage of their shares in the National Infrastructure Commission, the body that was set up to provide"
"It's been a long time coming, but the name ""The Punisher"" has finally been revealed at the end of the last season of Daredevil.

Showrunner Steven DeKnight revealed the name in an interview with EW, telling the publication:

I think it's a good name. I think it does sort of capture the fact that this is more of a Frank Castle type character. I think the names ""The Punisher"" and ""Daredevil"" were kind of taken from the back catalog of the comics, and I wouldn't want to do that. I think it's something I would love to do. I think it's an interesting concept. I think it's a very good name for a show.

That news comes right after the season finale of Daredevil, and follows a lengthy rumor that the show would be introducing The Punisher as a character in the show's third season.

A new teaser trailer released ahead of the season finale also teased the reveal of the new show's new character, who will be played by Jon Bernthal.

The Punisher first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1972. He first appeared in Daredevil #141, which introduced the character. A year after that, he was featured in The Amazing Spider-Man #1, where he first appeared in a fight against Spider-Man.

The character has appeared in a number of other comics, including Daredevil: Born Again #1, Daredevil: Death of the Family #1, Daredevil: The Man Without Fear #1, Daredevil: The Man Without Fear Annual #1, Daredevil: The Man Without Fear Vol. 2 #1, Daredevil: The Man Without Fear Vol. 3 #1, Daredevil: The Man Without Fear Vol. 4 #1, Daredevil #1, Daredevil #2, Daredevil #13, Daredevil #14, Daredevil #16, Daredevil #17, Daredevil #18, Daredevil #20, Daredevil #21, Daredevil #22, Daredevil #23, Daredevil #24, Daredevil #25, Daredevil #26, Daredevil #27, Daredevil #28, Daredevil #29, Daredevil #30, Daredevil #31, Daredevil #32, Daredevil #33, Daredevil #34, Daredevil #35, Daredevil #36, Daredevil #37, Daredevil #38, Daredevil #39, Daredevil #40, Daredevil #41, Daredevil #42, Daredevil #43, Daredevil #44, Daredevil #45, Daredevil #46, Daredevil #47, Daredevil #48, Daredevil #49, Daredevil #50, Daredevil #51, Daredevil #52, Daredevil #53, Daredevil #54, Daredevil #55, Daredevil #56, Daredevil #57, Daredevil #58, Daredevil #59, Daredevil #60, Daredevil #61, Daredevil #62, The Man Without Fear #1, Daredevil: The Man Without Fear #2, Daredevil: The Man Without Fear #3, Daredevil: The Man Without Fear #4, Daredevil: The Man Without Fear #5,"
"A common theme in the recent discussion about black lives and policing is the perpetuation of the myth that police violence only affects white people. The problem with this is that it's a lie, and it's a lie that the police do not profit from.

A simple example of this is the fact that police officers in the United States make over seven times more than the average citizen. These job-related benefits have been a source of considerable public discontent for a long time, but luckily the tide turned in the 1980s when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled police employees were not employees. This meant that police officers had to be treated as employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).

Unfortunately, in the years since that ruling, police unions have sought to expand their income by refusing to recognize the rights of their own members and by aggressively exploiting the FLSA. Unions like the Fraternal Order of Police, which has over 300,000 members in New York City alone, have been fighting to keep police officers as independent contractors, not employees, and to make it difficult for workers to organize and bargain collectively. This has resulted in police officers getting paid far less than the average worker, and union members are paid a much smaller percentage of what most employees make.

The typical police officer makes $54,000 a year (adjusted for inflation), while the average worker makes $40,000. The average police officer also makes significantly less than the average schoolteacher, who makes roughly $53,000. This is despite the fact that the average police officer is more likely to be armed and to be involved in violent encounters with the public than the average teacher.

In the last few years, police unions have been very aggressive in their efforts to keep their members from bargaining collectively. A recent police union contract in San Diego, for example, stipulated that police officers would not be allowed to unionize and would not be allowed to bargain collectively. It also included a new contract that included automatic dues deductions and other labor protections – such as an end to the requirement that police officers take 10 days of vacation every year.

The police unions have also been successful in fighting the expansion of the minimum wage. In St. Paul, Minnesota, for example, the police union successfully blocked the city from raising the minimum wage to $10.50 an hour, despite the fact that it would have helped the city fund social services and would have increased the number of jobs available to low-income workers.

The police unions have also been successful in blocking the expansion of overtime pay. In New York City, the police union successfully blocked the city from raising the overtime pay threshold to $160 an hour from $160.25 an hour. In 2011, the NYPD, which is notorious for its excessive use of force, made 18,000 arrests. A very small percentage of those arrests resulted in any charges, and the vast majority of arrests resulted in no"
"Crowdfunding sites for indie games

In our ongoing blog series, we're presenting a short list of crowdfunding sites that allow indie developers to raise money for their projects. These sites, for developers and fans alike, provide a platform to receive money online while making an impact. Many indie devs choose to accept on-funding platforms because of easy access to backers and a chance for free, honest feedback from people who love our games. Many of the games listed here are games that were initially crowdfunded as free games after their developers were inspired by a Kickstarter campaign. Some more well-known platforms include: FundRazr, Humble Bundle and YouCaring, among others. You can see the full list of sites here.

The biggest, most important, Indie Fund Challenge:

Over the course of four days, this contest will have thousands, possibly millions of people try to beat the $80,000 fundraising target.

We can't tell you what you'll be doing, and even if we could, it probably wouldn't be as creative as what you're creating. You won't be able to get in any kind of control over the project, and the chances of winning are about the same as going with a lottery. But the potential rewards and exposure are more than you could possibly know about. This contest will be one of the most interesting ways to see what it's like to raise money online.

This contest will feature some of the biggest game devs around.

Here's a peek at some of the people who are contributing:

Rory MacLeod is a long-time veteran game developer from Scotland, who currently works at Double Fine. MacLeod developed the role-playing game The Whispered World, an award-winning project for the iPad and Android operating systems. More recently, he is a producer and voice actor for the indie games DmC: Devil May Cry, and Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault.

Shawn Robertson has been a game developer for more than 12 years and has worked on many large-scale titles including Halo: Reach, Halo: Reach: Forward Unto Dawn, Dead Island, and the upcoming Dead Island: Epidemic. He has also worked on a number of indie games, including the horror game Amnesia: The Dark Descent and the strategy game The Escapists. He is currently working on RIGS, a project he started as a junior project.

Mike Bithell has a long history and experience in game development. He has worked on a wide variety of titles including the God of War, God of War Ascension, God of War III, God of War: Chains of Olympus, and God of War II games. Bithell also produced the feature film adaptation of the Dark Souls computer franchise.

"Update: The cause of death has been ruled as a heart attack, according to the Daily Record.

The body of a man has been pulled from a canal in the town of Llandudno, South Wales.

The man, in his 30s, was found in the canal near the village of Llandudno at approximately 9.45am on Friday.

A post mortem will be carried out to establish the cause of death.

The body was discovered in the water by a member of the public.

Local MP, Jo Stevens, said: ""My thoughts are with the family and friends of the man who has died as a result of what is believed to be a heart attack.

""I am offering my full support to the police in their investigation and urge anyone who saw something suspicious in the nearby canal to come forward."""
"(This essay is inspired by ""A Call to Action for All The Victims of Mass Shooters,"" the closing session of a panel on ""The American Gun Culture"" with me, James Alan Fox and the excellent Philip Jenkins, moderated by Jim Bunning at the Second Amendment Foundation's annual meeting, Feb. 4, 2013 in Nashville, TN. – Editor.)

There's been an outcry online and in the media, calling for a better plan to reduce gun violence. The issue is getting lost in the din of debate over gun issues: the President said this week he wants a new approach (including tougher background check laws), but his proposals fall far short of what the families and the survivors actually need, and don't address many of the root causes of gun violence.

But no one knows the root causes of gun violence more than the families of the victims. We have been studying them and working with them since they went public; in fact, the majority of our funding has come from them. And every year we're learning more, as new families come forward, and old ones tell us how they were affected by a shooting.

For example, we found that one of the biggest sources of gun violence is related to drug addiction and that these are the main root causes of gun violence. And the numbers show that the solutions don't always come from government bureaucracies: they come from working with families to get their children on treatment.

Here's why.

We've conducted the largest study of gun violence in the U.S., which, for the first time, includes nearly 20,000 gun violence deaths, and nearly 90,000 people whose families were affected by gun violence.

We've studied the families that have lost one or more members. We've met with them. We've asked them questions. And this is the way we've always approached gun violence: with respect, humility and curiosity.

As a parent of an 18-month-old, the most frequent question in my mind is, ""What's going to happen to my child next"" when a shooting happens. And it's not the first time.

When our daughter, Brianna, was murdered in an elementary school, four years ago in New York City, I sat at the hospital, as a bereaved parent, waiting for her to be told that someone would be charged with her murder. Then, to my surprise and happiness, our local media was given exclusive access. And they showed us the crime scene.

In the same time, as a grieving parent, I also found hope when we learned that federal law would be expanded and put an end to the ban on assault weapons. That meant that Brianna's killer could not legally purchase his gun. The news was breaking around the clock—it seemed like a normal day.

But I had not realized just how serious gun violence was for our family.

"You're not alone If you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of choices you have in this post-catastrophic world, you aren't alone—and our problem really is one of quantity. The problem is so bad that researchers at Princeton have spent the past decade trying to figure out what causes it. What they are finding is sobering: ""Some are thinking about artificial intelligence doing things like this before the human race does,"" says Nick Bostrom, director general of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University. Bostrom's institute had been studying the world's worst genocides. After the Nazis took action against the Jews in 1933, many refugees fled to the U.S. and Canada, hoping to live, work, study, and enjoy a normal life. In 1942, the Nazi-sponsored Nakba, or the 'catastrophe,' began. The first wave of refugees fled across the Atlantic but were quickly rounded up and forcibly dispersed; when they arrived in the U.S. and Canada, they encountered laws that segregated them from the rest of society. A second wave of refugees came to the U.S. after World War II—this time escaping the Soviets. In the early 1970s, the Soviets began destroying the cities of Eastern Europe, turning them into ghost towns—some with names like 'Stalingrad.' It took just a few million years for the cities to completely decay—and then only after the world's population had already reached seven billion. ""This shows the limits of our control and our ability to do anything about it,"" says Bostrom. ""And at what point do we get stuck?"" Many of the researchers studying this problem don't give humanity a fighting chance. They worry that the next mass extinction will happen before we even realize it's happening—a disaster that's too big to imagine, or to prevent, at least not before humans begin to destroy themselves. Most scientists believe there will be one to two mass extinctions in the next 10,000 years, with most of the species of the Earth killed in relatively short order. The reason for the disasters is relatively simple: Our planet is currently heating up. Climate change is creating more hurricanes and other types of extreme weather, which can cause widespread destruction in places that previously had to survive on the island status of islands such as New Zealand and Fiji. When it gets very hot, it doesn't matter if someone else is the only inhabitant in a city-state: people start to die out, and the city starts to turn into a desert, and then a graveyard. The human race is now at the second-most-vulnerable point of the species' existence: the point when the extinction-level events start to occur more often. Bostrom and others are beginning to argue that in order to avoid mass extinction, we need to change the way we do science and technology. Some experts say it's already too late to avoid runaway technological and scientific changes."

"The U.S. Geological Survey recently released new information about a massive earthquake that rattled the eastern part of the San Andreas Fault about three years ago. One of the most important factors in the quake was a large slab of earth, dubbed the Hayward Seismic Zone, that was recently found beneath the Los Angeles Basin, about a mile and a half beneath the surface of the water.

The Hayward Seismic Zone is actually one long slab and stretches for 1,100 miles and covers about 5 percent of the San Andreas Fault. It was created when the Pacific plate moved up along the surface of the Earth's inner core — the solid inner core — and the subducted plate dropped to the surface.

""There was more stress put on the plates in this area than in any other place we know about,"" said seismologist Mike Bovard, who is based at the University of California-Berkeley.

The Seismic Zone is not only huge in geographic size but it is also fairly symmetrical. This means that as a plate moves, the stress it puts on the layers above remains constant, meaning that as the Earth's layers move over time, the Seismic Zone will move as well. This creates what geoscientists call ""moments of converging plate boundaries.""

The Hayward Seismic Zone is about four miles thick, which would make it the largest seismic hazard ever produced on the entire San Andreas Fault. It includes the Southern Calaveras Fault, the Big Thompson, the Black Canyon, the San Joaquin San Andreas, the San Joaquin Valley Fault Zone, and portions of the San Andreas Fault, as well as portions of the Lassen Volcanic and the Owens Valley faults.

To get an idea of how big the Seismic Zone is, consider the San Andreas, which extends for about 14,900 miles and stretches from Northern California to Mexico, though it doesn't extend entirely in those directions, as does the Hayward Seismic Zone. The California coast lines approximately the size of the San Andreas; the San Joaquin Valley fault line is about one-third the size.

Scientists think the Hayward Fault Zone may be the world's largest, though they don't have a definite number in mind.

The recent discovery of the Hayward Seismic Zone is the result of a joint effort by the California Geological Survey, Los Angeles County and the Bureau of Land Management.

A team of geologists, including Bovard, analyzed satellite data, ground observations, and other data from the National Parks Service. In the process, they determined that the Hayward Fault Zone is about half the size of the previous largest documented seismic zone — over 1,000 miles long — on the San Andreas Fault. However, with a depth of about 400 to 1,800 miles and a width of about 3,000 miles, the Hayward Seismic Zone is at least twice as large"
"I've been thinking about the role of iconography in an arts education. I'm a big fan of the work of Richard Gage, and I've read his book, The Case for Iconography, which argues that the relationship between images and ideas is not a binary one. It's a complex, multi-faceted relationship, and I thought it might be helpful to discuss ideas about iconography in an arts education context.

In this post I will discuss the idea of a ""symbol,"" and how it relates to the concept of iconography. First, I'll consider the traditional concept of a ""symbol.""

The Symbol: A ""Symbol"" is a visual representation of a concept. The classic example of a symbol is the ""M"" in the form of a capital ""M,"" the letter ""M"" representing the movement, the movement of the mind, the mind's movement. In the case of the ""M"" in the case of the ""M"" in the ""M"" in the ""M"" of the ""M"", the mind's movement is thought to be the movement of the letter ""M,"" or the mind.

A symbol is a visual representation, and a visual representation is a representation that is representative of a concept that is not intended to be understood by the senses, but rather to be understood by the mind through the use of the senses.

A symbol is a representation of a concept that is not intended to be understood by the senses, but rather to be understood by the mind through the use of the senses.

A symbol is a visual representation of a concept that is not intended to be understood by the senses, and the mind is able to use the symbol to understand the concept.

A symbol does not represent the concept.

A symbol is a visual representation of a concept, but the symbol is not intended to represent the concept.

A symbol is a visual representation of a concept, but the symbol is not intended to represent the concept.

I think it's very important to understand that a symbol does not represent the concept.

A symbol is a visual representation of a concept, but the symbol is not intended to be understood by the senses, but rather to be understood by the mind through the use of the senses.

So, the symbol is a representation of a concept, but not intended to be understood by the senses.

"Takamimusubi is a Japanese wargame in which players take the role of Japanese forces. Players take control of a combat unit, which can be comprised of only infantry, cavalry, artillery, and aircraft. The main goal is to crush the enemy, and the game is played over a series of games.

In the game, whether the player controls the infantry, cavalry, artillery, or aircraft, there are two types of rewards for each type of unit. In the infantry unit, players get one point per unit killed. In the cavalry unit, players get two points per unit killed. In the aircraft unit, players get four points per unit killed.

In addition, there are several rewards for units that perform particularly well. For example, a unit that kills a single enemy unit earns two points. A unit that kills a group of enemies earns five points. A unit that kills the enemy leader earns ten points.

However, there are also rewards for units that perform poorly. For example, a unit that performs poorly earns two points. A unit that performs poorly and kills a group of enemies earns five points. A unit that performs poorly and kills the enemy leader earns ten points.

In order to get the maximum amount of points possible, players must perform well in each of the three game types, and they must also be able to complete the missions.

Players get the opportunity to acquire additional combat units at the beginning of each game by defeating enemy units. At each turn, players can move one unit from a group of units on the board.

The game board is divided into two parts, which are the home base and the enemy base. In the home base, players can build new units, and each unit costs one point. In the enemy base, players can also build new units, and each unit costs four points.

Each unit has a unique improvement for it, which can be used to upgrade the unit's statistics, or to improve the unit's combat ability.

Each unit can also have an improvement that is used to purchase units and make them more effective. Besides that, the unit also has a special ability that can be used to make certain units more effective or to make them less effective.

Players can use their units in different ways. Players can move them around the board, send them on missions, and attack with them. Players can also use their units to capture enemy units and use them in the home base.

In addition, a player can capture enemy units and use them in his or her home base. The player can also use his or her units in the home base to capture enemy units and use them in the enemy base.

Furthermore, players can purchase units, which are made of items including command cards. This allows players to use his or her units in different ways, such as attack with his or her own units or to capture enemy units.

"President Donald Trump said he has ""no idea"" if former FBI Director James Comey told him that the president was not under criminal investigation in an Oval Office meeting last week.

""I haven't seen it,"" Trump said on Fox News' ""Fox & Friends.""

""I have no idea,"" he said. ""I just heard about it a little while ago.""

Trump's comments came after it was reported that Comey wrote in a memo about a February meeting with Trump, saying the president asked him to drop the FBI's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

ADVERTISEMENT

Comey's memo is one of the main reasons the former FBI director has been scrutinized amid the FBI's investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

""I have no idea,"" Trump said of Comey's memo, when asked if he had seen it.

""I'll have to take a look at it. I'll be honest, I'll have to take a look at it. I'll be honest.""

The president also said he has ""no deals"" with Russia, which he has repeatedly called a ""ruse"" and ""scam.""

""I have no deals in Russia,"" Trump said. ""I don't have deals in Russia.""

The president also denied that he was under FBI investigation, saying ""nobody that I deal with"" is under investigation.

""There's no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians. There's no collusion,"" Trump said.

He also said there was no collusion between the Russian government and his campaign.

""There was no collusion,"" Trump said.

The White House on Wednesday formally responded to Comey's testimony, saying that Trump ""has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn."""
"(CNN) Just days after North Korea launched a barrage of missiles into the sea, the country's ambassador to Australia has been sacked, a US government official told CNN, in another setback for the US-South Korea alliance.

The United States has expelled North Korea's ambassador in Canberra on Sunday without explanation.

The US embassy in Pyongyang confirmed the news, but could provide no additional details.

A US State Department official told CNN that North Korea had acted in an ""unprecedented and flagrantly belligerent manner"" by firing a ballistic missile into the sea near Japan.

""This type of provocative behavior has consequences, and not just for North Korea but for the entire international community,"" the official said.

The Trump administration's reaction was swift but measured.

""North Korea's reckless behavior is wrong, it is dangerous, and it simply will not be tolerated,"" National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday. ""We will never tolerate the threat or use of nuclear weapons. And that is exactly what we saw yesterday.""

McMaster said the administration ""condemns the firing of an unprofessional missile and calls on North Korea to refrain from further provocations.""

""We reiterate our strong commitment to the security of the DPRK population,"" McMaster added, using the acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The US, he said, remains ""prepared to defend ourselves and our allies"" and to respond proportionately to any threat.

US President Donald Trump told Fox News on Sunday that he is ""very upset"" with the missile launch, which prompted a sharp rebuke and a threat to cut US diplomatic and economic aid to North Korea in retaliation.

""They've been talking for a long time, and this is a very small step. I'm not sure it's a major step, but it's a step in the right direction,"" Trump said on Fox News. ""Maybe it's not a big deal after all.""

""I don't know,"" Trump told CBS News in an interview on Sunday. ""Maybe it's a big deal after all.""

After the missile launch, the Japanese government said Sunday that it was deploying Patriot surface-to-air missiles at military bases across the country ""for increased monitoring and potential strike.""

""North Korea's irresponsible actions continue to jeopardize the international peace and security as well as the lives of Japanese citizens,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said.

"The NFL draft will be held on Thursday, April 27. Here's a look at some of the top prospects on the board.

The progress of the Dallas Cowboys' first-round pick, Ezekiel Elliott, has been well-documented.

At least that's what Jerry Jones, the team's owner, told Sports Illustrated's Peter King on Thursday.

""I was shocked at how quickly he got up to speed,"" Jones said. ""And it was in the first week of training camp. It was very impressive. He was so focused, and his focus has been great. It's been a great progression and a great sign he was able to get up to speed so quickly.""

The Cowboys, who have a first-round pick, will select No. 4, but Jones said they haven't ruled out making another trade.

""We're very active in our head-coaching search, and we're also in the process of evaluating players,"" Jones said. ""We're not going to sit here and say we're going to move up, move out or move back. We're going to assess the players and we're going to make the best decision for the team. So we're still very active in our search to find the right guy.""

The Cowboys have been linked to as many as 10 running backs, and Jones said the team will explore all possibilities.

""We will move quickly,"" he said. ""If we choose to trade back or move up, we will make the decision based on who is the best fit for our team.""

The Cowboys are also expected to add an offensive lineman, as well as a wide receiver.

The Cowboys are expected to pick LSU's Leonard Fournette in the first round, and will take Alabama's running back, Derrick Henry, in the second round, according to NFL draft analyst Dane Brugler.

""I'm hearing he's going to be there in the late first round,"" Brugler said. ""I'm hearing he's going to be out there in the second round.""

Here's a look at some of the other top prospects on the board.

Michael Thomas, Ohio State

Thomas is a big playmaker. He is a big-time, downfield threat who can create big plays for his team.

Thomas is a big, strong receiver who runs well. He has a long, lean body which helps him run under the ball and out-jump cornerbackbacks.

Thomas has good hands and catches the ball with his big hands and soft hands. Thomas is also a good route runner with the ability to get open underneath.

Thomas has good speed and is a fast, elusive runner.

He'll be a tough matchup for defenses.

The NFL is loaded at wide receiver, so the Cowboys need to add a big-play threat to their offense. So, Thomas could"
"MELBOURNE, Sept. 27 (UPI) -- Australia's prime minister, Tony Abbott, said he is ""horrified"" by images of a group of men in Australia and New Zealand beating a homeless Korean man.

According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, at least three men assaulted a homeless man in Melbourne, Australia, and took his phone away from him. The attackers told the victim, Kim Han-sol, ""We don't like your country.""

The men said, ""F--- you Korean b----.""

Australia has experienced a spate of violence against minorities -- from the racist graffiti directed at Aboriginal women at an inner-city Melbourne train station to attacks against Muslims at a Sydney mosque.

Two men have been charged and placed in custody after what is believed to be a racially fueled assault on three men at a North Sydney hotel.

Abbott said he was ""horrified"" to learn that the men had been beaten.

""We will have a review of our immigration system,"" Abbott said."
"The first thing we needed to figure out was what it means to be a ""man"" or ""woman"" in this system. It's a strange thing. For all the things women have had to fight for—the right to vote, to be treated with dignity at work, to be free and equal to men in education, in the military—the truth is that the majority of male workers still live in poverty. And women make up three times the workforce than men do.

This system is made for men, designed to keep them at bay, and it's not just about power, it's also about control: We can't have people running things all over the place.

I think feminism and its offshoots have allowed people to believe that ""men"" are the real power in this system, because feminism says, ""If men want to change it, let them.""

But that's completely inaccurate, and the truth is women have been at the center of this system. They have been at the helm of the media, they have been the heads of businesses, they have been the heads of corporations—all this stuff is run by women. They have been the primary beneficiaries, and so when people say, ""Why can't men just accept that they're powerless?"" That's only true if the power is just.

This system is designed to keep men at bay, and it's not just about power, it's also about control

We have to be aware, especially in the context of a feminist critique of these policies, of how that's reflected in what we call ""patriarchy."" This system is made to keep women down, is built for women, designed to keep them away. These are all systems that reinforce this, to keep women in one specific role over men is not okay.

And also, I think the biggest problem with this system is, it is really hard to fight for any particular policy, especially when the majority don't even know what that policy even is. What's really important, especially as Black people, is that we realize that this system is really rooted in racism, and that if we focus on the issues at stake at this moment, with all the crises we've had, we need to realize that this system isn't just about sexism, it's about racism."
"Plant-based diet research is at a crossroads, the new report says.

A top advisory group for the American Heart Association says the widespread adoption of low-fat diets is not helping people achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Instead, it's contributing to the growing obesity epidemic and increasing the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

In a new report, the AHA says the benefits of a plant-based diet are ""misunderstood"" and that the study results are ""overstated."" The report was issued by the AHA's Scientific Working Group on Nutrition, which is chaired by Dr. H. John Manson, director of the Harvard School of Public Health's Nutrition Obesity Research Center.

""The AHA has long advocated a healthy diet that is low in fat, sugar, and saturated fat. However, there is growing evidence that low-fat diets in some people may not be nutritionally adequate and may actually be associated with risk factors for coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes,"" said Dr. John F. Buring, AHA executive vice president and chair of the Scientific Working Group. ""The new report shows that the benefits of a plant-based diet are overstated.""

The AHA statement raises questions about the impact of widespread adoption of low-fat diets.

""The AHA's recommendations to reduce saturated fat, sugar, and sodium from all food sources are sound and appropriate,"" said Dr. Buring. ""However, the new report suggests that there is a part of the population that is more vulnerable to the adverse effects of a low-fat diet, particularly those with a family history of heart disease.""

The report's findings were based on three studies and data from more than 10 million people.

Study 1: Low-GI diets don't increase HDL and LDL cholesterol

In this study, people who followed a plant-based diet had significantly lower levels of total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol than did those following a low-fat diet.

Study 2: Losing weight does not add weight to the waistline

In this study, participants who followed a plant-based diet had a significant decrease in body weight over the course of the study, compared with those who followed a low-fat diet.

Study 3: Losing weight does not increase HDL cholesterol

In this study, people who followed a plant-based diet had a significant increase in HDL cholesterol compared with those who followed a low-fat diet.

The AHA says there's still some debate about the health benefits of a plant-based diet.

""While some studies show that people following a plant-based diet have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, others have failed to show a significant reduction in cardiovascular disease or diabetes risk,"" said Dr. Buring.

Dr. Manson said that, ""I think the message is, yes, you do need to eat a diet"
"[Update: In a statement to The Huffington Post, a Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged that the company did indeed receive a subpoena -- in violation of its policies of not commenting on any individual or proceeding -- and said ""We were fully cooperative with the court, and believe we have all the information we need to make the case."" We've asked the company if it would make available any further information on the case to clarify this statement but have not yet heard back.]

Earlier this month, Microsoft began releasing information on requests for user data from US law enforcement under the recently amended, controversial USA Patriot Act -- but the company only shared three examples, none of which relate to a specific criminal investigation.

Now the Justice Department has subpoenaed that information for ""Microsoft's entire customer base"" -- a total of 13.6 million US customers, Microsoft said in a statement sent to The New York Times. The information reportedly sought includes contact details for current and former subscribers, email addresses, usernames, and passwords.

In an accompanying press release, Microsoft further defended being uncooperative with law enforcement requests. ""We would rather not take a position on each request we receive,"" the spokesperson said. ""When a law enforcement agency has a valid legal request, we ensure we respond to them in a timely manner, provide relevant information, and allow them to continue investigation if necessary.""

""In many cases, companies have been reluctant to comply with such requests, and it is understandable that it may cause them concern for their future reputation and business relationships to disclose customer information.""

The full statement is below:

Today's announcement was made in connection with two court orders involving two legal authorities. The first request was a search warrant issued on March 20 for information related to an ongoing criminal investigation. The second application was a subpoena issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court on April 25 for information that was relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. The subpoenas are not related to any current or former service provider, and we have not entered into a gag order. We believe both requests are valid and lawful and, as we have done in the past, we will aggressively contest each one of them for as long as they remain in effect. In the case of the search warrant, the court authorized the issuing of a search warrant based on what the government said was evidence of a crime, which it then sought to seize.

When we receive a request by a legitimate law enforcement agency -- such as Microsoft would receive in the case of these two requests -- we fully cooperate. Microsoft receives and processes a vast volume of legal requests for customer data from governments around the globe. Unlike most firms, we do not provide the government with advance notice of these requests, or otherwise confirm whether they exist. Because of our industry's longstanding commitment to customer privacy and security, we never provide content such as the content of emails or other private communications even though we are legally required to do so."

" (CNN) Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was in contact with Russian officials before President Donald Trump took office, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.

The US intelligence community concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a hacking operation aimed at encouraging the Trump campaign to downplay the extent of its ties with Russia. Flynn, who served as Trump's national security adviser for just 24 days, was a key figure in that effort.

CNN has not confirmed the existence of evidence that Flynn had been in contact with any Russian officials, but the source said the issue came up in a conversation between Flynn and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who served on Trump's transition team.

According to a source familiar with the exchange, Yates told Flynn that she had information suggesting that Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail because he misled Pence about the nature of his calls during the transition period, when he was a vocal critic of the Kremlin and a supporter of US sanctions.

Yates told Flynn that he needed to be more careful about interacting with Russian officials, the source said.

In the days that followed, Flynn called a senior member of the Trump transition team to discuss the issue, according to the source. The source said the call lasted a half hour, and Flynn disputed the premise of the conversation.

Flynn's attorney said Monday that his client had not discussed lifting sanctions with Russian officials.

""General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,"" attorney Robert Kelner told CNN.

""But the story that he is about to tell is one that has already been told many times, and it involves the time before he joined the administration -- and the context in which it was told is even more troubling,"" he said.

""He has nothing to hide,"" he added.

Flynn resigned from his position as national security adviser on February 13 after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak.

After the resignation, the White House said Trump had asked Flynn to resign.

A federal investigation

In March, the Senate Judiciary Committee called on US intelligence agencies to investigate whether Flynn had lied to the FBI about his foreign contacts.

The committee's chairman, Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and ranking member, Dianne Feinstein of California, sent a letter to FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, requesting ""all memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings"" related to Flynn's contacts with Kislyak.

""I am writing to request that your offices provide the Committee with copies of any and all documents and recordings concerning Michael Flynn's communications with Russian officials, particularly with regard to the dates, times, and locations"

"An Australian teenager is facing trial in a Chinese police station for insulting the president on Facebook. According to local reports, 17-year-old Zhen Li had uploaded a screenshot of a speech made by President Xi Jinping at the United Nations that read: ""Our country has emerged as a global power. We must preserve our power and strength by unswerving and upright conduct of our state, business and people.""

Li's mother, who was not named by local media, reportedly told CNN that Zhen posted the screenshot of Xi's speech on her son's Facebook account, using the same profile picture and text that she has since added to her own profile. While the teenager's account was quickly deactivated, Australian police confirmed that he was still on a ""travel-related"" hold.

Zhen later deleted the post and deleted the Facebook account, according to one Chinese journalist who said that his friend's mother was still trying to contact the police. On Monday police in Kunming, the capital of southwest Yunnan Province, took his passport and cell phone and interrogated the teenager.

""We're still in the process of contacting him and determining his rights,"" said an officer at Kunming's traffic police station.

Zhen has previously been in trouble with police for posting material that was considered offensive to the Communist Party. However, his attorney, Zhu Jijia says that his client simply broke the law by offending a prominent political figure.

Zhen's case is being monitored by prosecutors.

Zhen, who has been detained since September 12, could face up to five years in prison after a local court determines whether or not charges should be passed.

It is not the first time that a foreigner has been prosecuted for insulting an individual who was the national leader. A Russian TV journalist and her husband were sentenced to jail and a fine for allegedly ""picking quarrels and provoking troubles"" against Russian President Vladimir Putin with a number of posts on social media platforms. Both of them were sentenced to 1 year in prison, a ban from using social networking services, and fines of 6,500 rubles. They had been sentenced for ""harming the foundations of Russia's statehood,"" according to the Russian press.

""China is taking the 'China threat' seriously""

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said it was a ""severe infringement"" on the right to free speech to send Zhen to a Communist Party police station.

""China is take[ing] the 'China threat' seriously,"" Geng said. He added that the government's ""stern condemnation"" will not go unnoticed by the international community. Geng also urged both Australia and Taiwan, which have been accused, to abide by the rule of law and not treat ""the internet the same as a dangerous terrorist environment.""

The ""China threat"" was also highlighted in Australia by Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop in a recent speech to"
"There are at least five, possibly more, potential suspects in the death of a New York police officer and the attempted murder of a bystander who died Tuesday in an explosion at the FBI in Quantico.

While there is no specific evidence in any possible involvement of Islamic extremist groups in the manhunt, FBI officials told Fox News on Monday that the explosion and shootout at their Quantico, Virginia, field office Wednesday were not a random act of violence. The two suspects in custody and a fourth man have been identified and are being held Wednesday in Quantico.

""We have no indication at this point that any of this would have been conducted by a lone wolf or a gang or a criminal network,"" Richard DesLauriers, assistant director of FBI's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said in a press conference on Monday. ""This was a calculated and premeditated attack on our FBI, and on the federal law enforcement officers who are charged with keeping the American people and our nation safe from terrorists.""

The two men being held in custody, 27-year-old Mohammad Abdulazeez, and 30-year-old Muhammad Dakhlalla, were charged in federal court Wednesday with using a weapon of mass destruction and use of an explosive device during a federal crime of violence. At least two of the other four people under consideration in the crime of violence case have yet to be identified, and the FBI says it hasn't determined if more charges may be forthcoming.

Dakhlalla is an Iraqi citizen, while Abdulazeez was a naturalized U.S. citizen and served in the military, according to Fox News. In other words, Islamic extremist groups are suspected in the attack, but not directly connected to it.

DesLauriers, the lead FBI counterterrorism official charged with tracking terror threats, said that the FBI believes ""it is highly unlikely that more attacks will be imminent."" But even if the investigation shows that there are more terror plots to be completed, he added, the Islamic State is not the ""sole entity or network responsible"" for the attacks.

As for whether anyone else participated in the crime, DesLauriers told Fox News, ""There's no other known or unacknowledged connection at this point.""

A photo of the car used in the attack released by the FBI in Richmond, Virginia, shows Dakhlalla is driving the car, while Abdulazeez is standing in the car's backseat. The photo also shows that the driver's side door is open. It also shows that the front door of the car is locked. The FBI released photographs of additional three suspects.

""To the best of our knowledge, in this investigation there have been no injuries to any other persons, nor to any law enforcement officers or contractors,"" said DesLauriers. ""But we will look into the possibility of that.""

"The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) net neutrality rules are a mess, and the agency's Republican leadership is apparently taking the blame for the mess.

On Monday, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) introduced the FCC Reclassification Transparency and Accountability Act, which aims to force the agency to disclose more information about its proposed net neutrality rules.

The bill would also require the FCC's chairman to publicly disclose, ""the existence of any legal or factual basis for a proposed action,"" as well as ""any legal or factual analysis or legal opinions regarding the legal sufficiency of the stated legal or factual basis.""

The FCC net neutrality rules were put in place in late 2015 and took effect early this year. As the New York Times noted yesterday, the new rules have not been received well by the public, with the agency's net neutrality comments running on average about 1,000 comments per day.

The agency's commissioners were expected to vote on a proposal to reclassify broadband as a Title II telecommunications service on Thursday, but the vote was delayed. The FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, has said he wants to vote on the reclassification proposal before the end of the year."

"The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra's community.

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.

In the following post I'll discuss how many gamers (and developers) tend to view the 'PC gamer as a'male', with a stereotypical male body type. In this post, I will first discuss how much I find this view to be harmful.

What is Gender? Is the PC Gamer Male?

While many people (and some people even outside of gaming) view the 'PC gamer' as a'male', there has always been some confusion over this. A quick search revealed some very negative views on gaming websites. Some articles are completely ignorant of the difference between the PC gamer, and a 'gamer' in general on PC.

Some articles (for example) claimed that the PC Gamer is a 'girl' because he 'plays' games like Super Mario Bros (as if they are something that could not be enjoyed by males either). Other articles simply stated that the PC Gamer is a 'guy' because he has a large penile length (e.g. a penis length that is at 100% – i.e. larger than average for male gamers).

So what's the big deal? Well, it's not that the negative opinions about the PC Gamer are incorrect, it's just that people are not being clear and balanced about what this category means. I will come back to more details about the PC Gamer in a subsequent post, but the point is that there is a clear misconception about the PC gamer.

So, what is PC Gamer?

The simple definition for 'PC Gamer' is the one provided by www.thegamergatehq.com:

the term PC Gamer refers to the audience which is mostly young males and is the main target audience of the ""movement"". The ""movement"" is an increasingly active, organized campaign by certain gaming journalists to shut down discussion or opinion of topics which are considered controversial and inappropriate for the target audience within the industry. For example, in games in which violence, sexism or misogyny is an important element of the plot or in which a strong ethnic group is portrayed negatively, in order to appease the ""movement"" these issues are made to be removed or toned down. The ""movement"" often operates under the guise of 'torture porn' or as a way – similar to the movie 'Rampante' – to 'punish' the targets of its ire.

This definition doesn't provide much insight how many people view the PC Gamer. I'll quote from another website that attempts to further explain the matter:

The ""PC Gamer"" is…well, you and who ever you consider your other ""gender""…

For example, ""The guy who plays Call of Duty"
"(Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Thursday that the United States would end a program that shielded nearly 200,000 young people who came to the United States illegally as children, a move that would affect tens of thousands of people across the country.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions waits to deliver remarks at a news briefing at the Justice Department in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas

Sessions said that the Obama administration policy had led to the ""terrible situation"" of illegal immigrants flooding the U.S. education system and in turn threatening the safety of both U.S. citizens and U.S. children.

""I will not defend or authorize a program that deprives American students of a education simply because their parents brought them into the country illegally,"" Sessions said.

The decision by Sessions, who has expressed skepticism about undocumented immigrants' contribution to U.S. society, is likely to anger the young immigrants, many of whom worked hard to escape abuse or other dangers in their home countries.

The young undocumented immigrants, typically referred to as ""Dreamers,"" would qualify to remain in the United States under Obama's 2012 deferred action program, which allowed some undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children to temporarily work and go to school without fear of deportation. Some recipients are working now in agriculture and in domestic work, such as cleaning houses.

Trump, a Republican, has previously indicated he would eliminate Obama's 2012 program, but his aides have been vague about what he would do with the nearly 200,000 young immigrants with deferred action under the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

On Thursday, top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee said they believed the administration would continue to protect the program, but the lawmakers, who oversee federal spending, indicated they were open to the possibility of giving the young people a way to get legal status.

The Trump administration's move was met with enthusiasm from immigrant rights advocates across the country, with many arguing that the program had allowed many young illegal aliens to enroll in college and eventually make good careers for themselves.

""It is imperative that we do everything we can to keep Dreamers from returning to a dangerous place to find that same life they left behind,"" said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which supports the Dream Act, which would allow illegal immigrants to obtain legal status.

Immigrant rights advocates are worried that Trump's administration could cancel DACA and leave the people, many of them employed for years in a variety of professions, with no way to work legally in the United States.

Trump's predecessor, Republican Barack Obama, issued a comprehensive order on immigration in 2012 that said the federal government would no longer deport young illegal immigrants who had been brought to the United States illegally by parents.

"""Honey, this is one of the top 10 best restaurants in the world right now,"" I say as we are preparing dinner for our family at a trendy new Los Angeles restaurant called Alinea.

""That's crazy,"" she replies.

""It's the best food there is,"" I say.

""But it's expensive.""

""It's just expensive,"" I respond.

""You know this isn't a casual dinner when you can get this for this price,"" she sighs.

A few weeks earlier, my daughter had gone to the movies, and was starving. She looked in the menu and noticed she could get two entrees for the price of one. She figured she could afford such meals and was about to go until I pointed out that the restaurant offers a free dessert at the end of the meal. Her jaw dropped.

""Two dessert entrees?"" was my only response, before turning to my friend, who told her that ""that's what they do in Italy, it's called Amatriciana.""

I know what you are saying. Are Italian restaurants just more expensive? Or does Amatriciana have anything to do with dessert, too?

Yes, at Alinea, there is dessert. But that's not all.

While I was at Alinea recently, I ate dessert for a reason. My daughter had a big-dessert party with the school's social-studies teacher. The dessert? Panna Cotta, a specialty at Alinea. It's just that good, and there's no substitute for tasting it.

When the chef prepares panna cotta, he'll use just about any type of fruit of the season. It takes his time to make it correctly -- but once it's right, no one will know the difference. On his own two feet, he will carve and slice the fresh fruit, so you have all the care and attention the chef could ever spare.

But we are different, we don't have the time for that. We are busy feeding a hungry family. If we knew how bad we wanted dessert that first day, we might be willing to pay an extra $50 a plate for the luxury of knowing that our dessert was going to be served well. That would be a great gift for any holiday celebration, and it would definitely make for an even better birthday for you. Or, if you want a party, you could serve it on a cake or plate to celebrate a birthday of the mother-in-law who's been with the family for 40 years.

You don't need to know the whole story to appreciate the deliciousness of panna cotta. Just taste some if you don't know any better.

But, if the panna cotta is good enough to eat on its own, then what, pray tell, makes it that much better than the other"

"I like this quote by Michael Moore from 'Roger & Me' where he says 'We got to make politics sexy...because it's sexier than sex.' In his book 'Unstoppable,' Moore goes on to make it clear that all women are sex objects:

[H]e could not sleep with one of them without feeling he was cheating on his mother.

He goes on to describe his own experience and says that it was not the sex that was the problem, it was the manipulation and control that was the problem. Moore's definition of Sex-as-Control and Abuse of Power is a perfect example of the 'Sex as Power' syndrome. This is not an exclusive definition of Sex-as-Power. For example, we know that there are two kinds of abusers. The ones who manipulate (those who abuse) and the ones who abuse (the ones who abuse) and there is even an overlap of abusers and abusers, and the abuse has very similar patterns and components to the abuser.

Now when we consider the sex industry, specifically the porn industry and the commercial sex industry we're seeing another type of abuser as well: the commercial sex abuser.

In the commercial sex industry, a commercial sex abuser will often use sex-as-power as a weapon to manipulate. We see this everywhere in porn-as-power-abuse with men controlling, dominating and exploiting women.

The difference though, with the commercial sex abuser, is that they are not sexually exploiting an individual, they're exploiting a power imbalance of control. They aren't treating a client like they are the clients sexual partner, and they are acting like it. The abuser will always act like it is the clients pleasure to use their power in one way or another.

I have been a client of a commercial sex therapist for two months. I've gotten nothing more out of him than a diagnosis.

As a client I was manipulated, abused and lied to. It is a crime to use pornography as a weapon to manipulate people, and I am shocked that this is what I received in return.

My abuser is a commercial sex abuser."

While many have already taken the chance to share their ""Aunt Jemima"" memories in light of the passing of the beloved TV host on Friday, many have yet to come up with a way to honor the legacy Jemima left behind.

On a forum called Aunt Jemima Fans, members are sharing their own memories of playing with, watching and talking with ""Jemima,"" their ""Aunt Jemima."" On Facebook, the page has so far accumulated over 8,000 ""likes.""


""The memories we have are priceless,"" one fan wrote.

As reported by Buzzfeed, over 20 years ago, the TV personality hosted the long-running ""Aunt Jemima"" game show and was married to the show's creator, Bob Saget.

Though Saget took some heat for his decision to take the young ""Aunt Jemima"" on the road, many still fondly remember the show's early years.

But for some, that was not enough.

The most famous of Uncle Jesse's grandchildren, Sarah Ferguson-Tucker, has launched an online crowdfunding effort to create a memorial statue of Aunt Jemima to be located near her home, located in Columbia, S.C.

The statue will be a tribute to the legacy and love of Bob Saget and his show, though Ferguson-Tucker would also love an opportunity to share her Aunt Jemima's story and her legacy along with her.

Ferguson-Tucker's campaign page has already raised nearly $9,000 of its $50,000 goal so far, which will go towards purchasing the statue.

Ferguson-Tucker and Saget have had a complicated relationship. Saget was married to Ferguson-Tucker's mother, but they split up several years after the show's debut. According to her website, Ferguson-Tucker's mother is currently raising her son while still paying back a small amount for each birthday he misses.


But Ferguson-Tucker is far from the only one who wants to honor Saget's legacy with a statue. The campaign for a Jemima statue, named in her honor, has already raised nearly $8,000 on a GoFundMe page in support of Ferguson-Tucker's campaign, which is asking people to donate $250, to help kick-off construction on the statue.

There's no word on when exactly construction of the statue will begin, but both plans have met with great success thus far."
"Saskatoon, SK - The Saskatoon Blades have signed defenceman Tyler Toffoli to a Professional Tryout (PTO) agreement for the 2015-16 season, general manager Craig Leipold announced today.


Toffoli, 24, registered three assists (0-3—3) in 14 games for the Los Angeles Kings during the 2014-15 season. The six-foot, 195-pound native of San Diego, CA was selected by the Kings in the seventh round, 192nd overall, during the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. He led all Kings blueliners and ranked third among NHL rookies on the Kings in defensive ice time per game (21:18) to go with 25 penalty minutes."
"The city's police chief, in his first official interview since he resigned earlier this month, told The Globe and Mail that he regrets the way he handled the public disclosure of the death of Sammy Yatim, one of two men shot by his own police service earlier this year.

The chief, Mark Saunders, said in his first interview since he stepped down, the only way he wants to put that behind him is by finding work with the Toronto Police. The chief told the newspaper that being forced to deal with his critics was the main reason he stepped down. He told the newspaper in an interview that he believed an apology was the only option.

""To my colleagues I say the only way you get the truth and put that behind you is to take responsibility for your mistakes,"" Chief Saunders said in an interview Wednesday in his new job on a police communications advisory panel and later at City Hall. ""I wish I could say something different.""

Story continues below advertisement

The chief's move has been criticized from the outset as not meeting a legal requirement on transparency. Even so, the police board and the mayor continue to support the chief and have not made any calls to fire him.

""There has been some criticism that I took the information and put it out. As I told them, I have done that before. I have put things out for the public domain because I'm always trying to get better and better at my job,"" he said. ""Of course, you want the public to know about something like that, and I'm going to apologize for that.""

Chief Saunders told The Globe and Mail that his public apology did not come lightly. He recalled how he and his senior leadership team felt after the police board first asked him in late March for an explanation of how he reacted to the shooting deaths of Mr. Yatim and Mr. Samuel. ""We were in a meeting where I was the only person there. I'm the police chief. I have to explain what I felt and I took some steps back. But then I went right on to explain what I think I would have done differently, if I were there.""

Mr. Saunders said he believed he was speaking truthfully.

""I'm really disappointed that I felt the need to apologize again. I feel that was something very personal coming from me,"" he said.

Chief Saunders was the second-highest-ranking officer in the Toronto Police Service in 2007 when the former chief, Howard Polak, made the decision to have him step down. The Toronto Professional Police Association opposed his removal, saying it could have been reversed.

In 2009, the Toronto Police Service reached a $2.5-billion deal for nearly all the city's police vehicles after the province turned down a previous offer of $700,000.

"PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Penguins are hoping that they can become the first team in NHL history to win every game in which they're 3-0.

""We're 3-0. It's all smiles,"" defenseman Rob Scuderi said. ""We've been through a lot of adversity. We've just got to keep on going.""

They've been through a lot of adversity. They've just got to keep on going.

The Penguins are on their way to becoming the first team in NHL history to reach the playoffs in each of their first four seasons. They're on their way to becoming the first team to win all four of their first games.

They're on their way to becoming the first team in NHL history to win at least three of their first four games.

""We're here for a reason. We're playing for a reason,"" defenseman Kris Letang said. ""We have an opportunity here to make some history.""

The Penguins (37-22-8) are a half-game behind the Washington Capitals for the second wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference standings. They've won the first three games of the season by a combined score of 23-7.

""We're playing some good hockey,"" defenseman Evgeni Malkin said. ""We're playing well defensively. We're playing hard. We're playing good. We're playing a pretty good game right now.""

The Penguins are getting points from their power play (15-for-33, 20.9 percent) and penalty kill (83.3 percent). They're also leading the league in goals (43) and shots on goal (331).

""The table is set,"" coach Dan Bylsma said. ""We've got a great team here. We've got great depth. We're good on the PK. We get to work with our best players. We don't have to worry about guys that are back-up guys or guys that are not good players.""

The Penguins have won four straight games against the Pittsburgh Penguins, a streak that dates back to a 4-0 win on Dec. 26, 2013, at Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh.

They're playing their fourth game in five nights after playing a seven-game road trip to start the season.

""It's just a great situation for us to be in,"" Letang said. ""The guys are in the right spot, and it's great to be playing on the road. We've had a lot of good opportunities to get points, and this is a good opportunity to get a win.""

The Penguins have scored three goals in the first period at home this season. They've outscored the Panthers 34-19 in the opening period of their three games at PPG Paints Arena.

"""I was just really proud."" My friend, who'd just given birth at home, was crying tears of joy. She said, ""I wish I had been around to tell them I was in the army.""

In many ways this is the story of military history. The American Revolution did not create a republic. That was established by the colonists themselves. Even before the war, a large majority of Americans were fed up with the king and Parliament and wanted a free republic.

The revolution took many turns, but ultimately the colonists won. They were able not only to hold off the king, but also, with the help of the new republic's army, to defeat Parliament. Britain did eventually give up its British colonies and join its brother powers on the side of the United States.

This story of the American Revolution is often told as a romantic story of resistance. It's a story of patriotism. And it's a popular one. But there were many casualties. One in three men who went to fight in the Revolutionary war died. That was twice the rate of soldiers killed in the Napoleonic Wars. The United States lost at least one million soldiers.

That is not a statistic to be proud of.

I don't understand why so many Americans don't understand what happened, and why many people cling to the belief that the Revolution was a glorious battle that changed the world. But it didn't.

As an outsider, I can only see the people in power, and I think it says a lot about them when they don't want you to understand what happened.

For starters, I don't understand why the revolution is called ""revolution"" — for the revolution ended the King's authority, not a revolution against the King.

And what of the millions killed? In this country, the term ""total war"" is used to describe conflicts in which many civilians die. That description applies in many types of war; it doesn't apply in the Civil War.

And as for the American colonies being ""peaceful"" before the war: they weren't. Many towns and villages were burning all the time as the British forces marched to battle. The British did not come to ""liberate"" these colonies from their oppressors — they were just protecting their own population and interests.

So why does America think it is special and unique because its army was victorious over its foreign enemies?

A country's story is not a simple narrative. It is a picture, or a collection of pictures. Each picture represents a place, and each place represents people. Each person represents a time. Each time, and the people within it, has a story of how they arrived at that point and what brought them there.

American history is a long story of different people coming together to create a shared history. The American revolutionaries did have a story of the beginnings of the American republic. But they had no story"
"PARK CITY, Utah — The only thing more amazing than the availability of ""Star Wars"" toys at this year's Toy Fair was the fact that it took over a month for the first official photo of the new ""Star Wars"" film to come out.

A man was arrested Sunday for allegedly robbing a woman at gunpoint in the 18900 block of Hazel Street in Viera.

According to the report, the victim was walking home when a man with a handgun approached her and demanded her purse. The woman told the man that she did not have anything in her purse and the suspect fled on foot.

"The latest in the Post's series of ""The Big 12's Biggest Problems"" is on the league's success in recruiting top-tier players.

""The Big 12 is getting better, but not as much as it could be. The league's average recruiting class is a little smaller than it was last year, when the league won the national championship,"" writes TCU's Gary Patterson. ""It would be nice to see a few more of the top prospects, but the Big 12 is in a good spot. It's a conference whose championship teams can win the national championship.""

Here are highlights from Patterson's piece:

In the past four recruiting classes, transfers have accounted for more than 75 percent of the Big 12's class, and they have been the focus of the scrutiny. School officials say that's because they are not allowed to spend a year on a team after transferring to a different school. In the past three classes, the league has had a total of seven transfers in one class, and five of them (including three in this year's class) have been starters.

""The Big 12 is not getting better because of transfers,"" said TCU coach Gary Patterson.

The Big 12 is not getting better because of transfers.

The Big 12 is getting better because the teams are better.

The Big 12 is getting better because the teams are better.

It's a fair point.

There are two things that stand out to me about that last paragraph.

1) The Big 12 is the most successful conference in college football.

2) The Big 12 is not getting better because of transfers.

I wonder what Patterson would say if he were told that the Big 12 is getting better because of transfers.

No, if he was told that the Big 12 is getting better because of transfers, he would probably think the Big 12 is getting worse.

The Big 12's average class size is the smallest in the past four recruiting classes. TCU's average class is the smallest in the last four recruiting classes. Oklahoma's average class is the smallest in the last four recruiting classes. Texas Tech's average class is the smallest in the last four recruiting classes.

'We need our friends, Alistair!'

She'd been holding his hands. The sun beat down on them, and a cold wind blew through their hair. She leaned over him and pressed her lips against his, and he thought he heard the word, yes. That should've been enough for his ears, what's the matter? But it was only for his heart.

Gin took a deep breath—the wind was dying. She stepped away and held him to her, kissing him with the softest of kisses. Alistair knew that even if she weren't kissing him, he'd still feel a sharp touch on his side.

I…can we…be friends again? she'd asked. I miss you, Alistair.

She took a deep breath and stepped into his embrace. She pressed her lips against his and he heard her say, yes, just let it be!

They'd been at Dragonstone to protect the realm from the return of the shadow in order to avoid the worst possible outcome—a complete destruction of Westeros. While they didn't get too far, Alistair wasn't quite sure how successful they'd been.

But they did manage to keep the realm from being destroyed.

Gin and Alistair were the last four people left on the ship—the rest were dead by the time they reached the safety of the continent. Alistair was going to take his parents with him, but Gin told him to leave them behind and to search for his friends, even if it meant their deaths. The others would come to him, not him to her.

She took him by the hand and brought him back to the cabin. Alistair wanted her to stay with them. Gin hugged him hard around the hand, and looked up at the sky, smiling at Alistair.

He smiled, too.

""Gin—it's cold outside.""

""You'll warm up a little, you know that?""

""…yeah.""

"The victim of the May 27, 2010, death of teenager Marcus Luttrell told the San Jose Mercury News that she was ""upset"" when her ex-boyfriend, who stabbed her and left her to die in his truck, pleaded guilty Tuesday to second-degree murder.

""I was upset that he didn't get life in prison,"" Jessica Graves, 18, told the newspaper in an interview. ""I didn't believe he was going to get life in prison. I thought that he was just going to get probation. He deserved to get life.""

Luttrell, 24, of San Jose, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and felony murder in the death of Graves, a high school senior from San Jose who was stabbed to death in the parking lot of a San Jose Costco during a drug deal gone bad.

The teen's mother, who was in court during the sentencing, expressed surprise that her daughter's killer would plead guilty to a lesser charge, the Mercury News reported.

""I was in shock,"" Graves' mother, Tammi Graves, told the newspaper. ""I'm just glad that he's guilty. He deserves to be punished for what he did. I didn't think that he would do it. I didn't think he would admit to it.""

Graves told the newspaper that she still feels anger toward Luttrell but hopes the small amount of time he will spend behind bars will help him get over the loss of her daughter and move forward with his life.

Luttrell ""doesn't really have a life,"" Graves said. ""He's like a prisoner in his own home. He's really not going to be able to get out of that place, and he's going to have to live with it.""

Luttrell will be sentenced Dec. 11 and faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for Dec. 22.

Luttrell is scheduled for another sentencing hearing in January.

"It's been said that no one ever goes broke underestimating the intelligence of a goldfish. But there are a few people, like the founder of the United Nations, who have tried and failed. I'm speaking, of course, of Joseph Stalin.

For many reasons — economic, political or just plain sad — Stalin failed to see the USSR through the Great Depression of 1929. His advisers underestimated their ability to maintain national industry during a period of severe financial hardship. Stalin did not see how the Soviet economy could survive during the Great Depression. Stalin was, above all, a politician who believed that a strongman was the answer to all of society's problems.

Yet if the Soviet Union had managed to keep growing in the 1920s, with a solid and strong central government, all might well have been well. But as the crisis deepened, it became clear that the Soviet state couldn't keep up. Instead, it collapsed. As was the case in many other countries at the time, the government was unable to keep up with the rapidly growing demands of an expanding population. People lost their jobs and money in droves, making possible shortages in the goods that were so important to the new Soviet industrializing society. In the chaos that followed, the Soviet government was forced to create one last attempt to stave off bankruptcy. One of the first things the government did was cut off the sale of bread, which made it necessary to ration the remaining bread. This brought about the Great Hunger.

Stalin's advisers also underestimated the extent of the famine, in which an estimated 10% of the Soviet population died between 1932 and 1933, or one million people. The Soviet government tried to hide the extent of the famine by destroying tens of thousands of tons of official records.

In his final years, Stalin was determined to get the Soviet state back on its feet again. But once it was on its feet again, Stalin believed that it would never fully recover until it had a modern, strong economy. This meant that the Soviet Union would move toward socialism, something that could never happen without an ample supply of labor on hand, as well as vast resources and an enormous military, all financed by Soviet taxpayers. After the war, he saw a new, strong, prosperous Russia was the only way for his country to survive.

Although the new economy that took root during Stalin's reign did not last, it did create jobs, provide a stable, reliable source of income and put the resources of the state at the disposal of the Soviet people. It didn't just solve the hunger — it also gave people the security and stability to be able to build a new country and a new state in their own image.

For a brief moment in Soviet history, the Soviet Union actually looked like a functioning country. But in the end, it failed."
"The Barrington District School Board passed a resolution Tuesday that would allow the district to hire someone in the next five years to teach all and sundry, including transgender students.

The resolution, which passed 7-0, was initiated by board member Tony Baudhuin.

Baudhuin told the committee that he's scheduled to host a seminar next Wednesday on the subject.

""I think it's a great idea,"" stated board member Gene Bodnar. ""I think we have to look at all aspects of what's going on in the world.""

The idea of extending the district's hiring authority to cover transgender students — which previously had been limited to teachers — was not a unanimous vote.

Baudhuin said he has received ""overwhelming"" support from his fellow school board members.

""I don't think there's any other board in the state of Illinois that has more transgender people,"" said Baudhuin. ""I didn't expect this.""

He said the event will also be attended by the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois.

""There's a lot of transgender people that live in this community,"" said Baudhuin. ""It was really important to me to have people from these groups to come and share their experiences.""

Baudhuin said he had hoped to provide a forum for teachers and principals to discuss transgender issues and how to change their attitudes toward the program.

""I want to help them see a different way,"" he said. ""And I think this is the way to do it."""
"Kourtney Kardashian has a fairly extensive fan base, but she's also become known for more than just her social media presence.

In recent years, the reality star has carved out a niche as a cosmopolitan celebrity who designs her own line of luxury clothing and accessories. And despite her growing fame, she wouldn't mind sharing some of that fame with the world.

""I would love to get on a flight and go to everywhere,"" Kardashian tells PEOPLE in a new new interview. ""I don't want to be somewhere and see a giant wall and a bunch of people talking some junk. I want to see a wall that's beautiful, that's interesting, that's interesting to me.""

Kardashian is just one of a handful of celebrities who have embraced the idea of traveling the world and experiencing different cultures.

""I'd love to explore as much as I can,"" she adds. ""I want to experience so many things.""

Kardashian, 30, has been modeling since 2001. She appeared in the ads for the American Eagle Outfitters spring collection, and has been photographed for the likes of Vogue, Elle and Glamour.

Kardashian is on the cover of Glamour's September issue and is working on a book about her life. She recently sold her stake in her eponymous clothing line for $100 million.

"Tiger Woods has been a golfer for a long, long time. While all that long string of PGA Championships and Nike commercials has made for a great narrative, I believe the reality is that Tiger has won at least a few majors in recent years, most likely over the course of several years.

However, I find it very hard to look past Tiger's recent performances and assume that's because he's somehow gotten better.

Here's how I'm looking at the 2015 season from Tiger's perspective:

Tigertown: 6-0 (tied for 5th best at major championship)

Bandon Dunes: 2-2 (tied for 5th best at major championship)

The 2015 Masters: 4-1 (6th best at major championship)

The 2015 Honda Classic: 3-1

I've had very mixed results going back to 2011, one of which was winning the 2009 Players Championship, which marked the second straight year I got the best finish of my career. As far as other results, I finished 3rd in the 2013 Players Championship at Torrey Pines and 3rd in the 2014 Players Championship at Eagle Point. I finished 7-7 in 2014 at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions.

The year before that was 2-2 at Bandon Dunes and the year before that 3-1 at the Honda Classic.

Since those 2 years Tiger's never had a better performance than 2nd at a major championship and 5th best finishing, which is obviously not good enough. Since 2011 Tiger hasn't even finished outside of the Top-25 in Major Championships. Not good enough.

Tiger has yet to finish as high as 7th at a major championship nor has he ever completed the triple crown of being an eagle-fowler (tied for 3rd at majors). He's never played a championship event, nor made a final of the Honda Classic.

Tiger's numbers have been good, but I'm not sure many people would be able to say that these are elite golfer performance numbers on par with or even better than John Daly. In fact, I would argue that in the past 5 years we have seen a dramatic improvement in Tiger's performance, especially since 2012.

Since Tiger's rookie campaign in 2004, when he won the PGA that year, he has been ranked in the top 4 at every major championship he has played. He's currently ranked 5th in the world, 6th in the world is he's now been out with the injury.

The thing that stands out to me is that I know we've only been talking about Tiger for the last 5 years, but I'm still struggling to accept that Tiger is a better player than John Daly. It's just not the case.

Maybe in the coming years this trend will continue…"

Today, it is easy to see the huge success of video game franchises like the Star Wars franchise, or the Batman franchise, or the Lord of the Rings franchise that people all over the world enjoy playing. But what about other aspects of the industry that have not received the same amount of attention? What do some of these smaller video game titles have that other high profile gaming franchises do not?

1. A strong story

A simple way to describe the success of many high profile video game franchises is that they are full of characters, they are complex, and they have a huge impact. The stories of the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings franchise are both epic and inspiring and can rival or even surpass anything that is on television today. But many video games just focus on fighting the enemies and progressing through levels; there is not a lot of story in video games and that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly does take away from the game.

There has obviously been a lot of debate on whether video gaming is dead, or if there are still plenty of people who continue playing video games regularly. But if the story that most video game franchises provide is not a very good reason for those who don't already play games like Mass Effect, or Halo or Call of Duty, then maybe it just isn't as appealing as those other series with great story."

WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump's approval ratings hit a record low in the latest CNN/ORC poll with Americans viewing him as a serious threat to national security and political stability.

The poll finds that 62% disapprove of Trump's leadership while 34% say his presidency ""is going well."" Trump has suffered a downward trend on favorable ratings for most of his first year in office. The president's disapproval ratings have remained steady since late July and have climbed slightly since early August.

The president's overall approval rating has fluctuated between 39% and 50% in Gallup's daily tracking surveys. A majority of voters disapprove of his handling of race relations and of his decision to pardon former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio.

Trump's disapproval rating on handling of race relations has increased from 59% in July to 72% a month later according to CNN/ORC's polling, while his approval rating on the decision to pardon has held steady, now at 53%. A majority, 57%, disapprove of Trump's handling of U.S. relations with Russia.

A majority of respondents, 51%, also disapprove of Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey last week. The President argued that Comey's handling of his investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server was an act of partisan retaliation, even though the FBI head refused to help the agency's investigation into the Trump campaign's possible Russia ties, and even though Comey recommended in October that the FBI should not recommend charges to the Justice Department about Clinton.

In July, 54%, told POLITICO that they did not think Comey told the truth when he said that his agency did not rely on information from former national security adviser Michael Flynn in the initial FBI investigation into Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador. In August, 57% of voters said that Comey's testimony about his conversations with Trump, in which Trump said Comey assured him repeatedly that he was not under investigation, was not credible.

In addition, voters disapprove of Trump's handling of race relations by 61%, 60%, and 61%, respectively, versus 38%, 41%, and 37%, respectively, who say the president has done a good job on the issue.

In the CNN/ORC Poll, just 32% of Americans say America will be ""very confident in its next president,"" an all-time low for President Trump. In his first 100 days, the CNN/ORC Survey found that 62% of Americans said Trump will be a failure.

The poll's respondents were also asked who they think will come out on top in the 2020 election. Trump was the first to win the poll in terms of favorability, with 58% of respondents viewing Trump favorably. More Americans, 60%, said Trump will be a failure in four years, versus 45% who said he would do a good job.

"A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled across a small article on the website of the National Association of Broadcasters, which published an article by Robert Siegel from The Washington Post entitled 'What is your favorite television commercial of all time?'

That's the first paragraph of the article, which is also one of the most amusing ones I've ever saw.

A couple of days later, I stumbled upon a new book on the topic by Robert Siegel, who wrote an equally humorous essay on why a person might decide that commercialism in general, not just one particular commercial is the worst.

I think it's safe to say that many people, myself included, had been on an ad hunt since the article appeared. In fact, the ad hunt is probably something that you've all been on. However, just because ads are everywhere doesn't in itself make them good or worthwhile. In fact, the reason they're everywhere is because of advertising. And, it was that idea, combined with the fact that the advertising industry is generally responsible for the marketing for virtually the entire mass media in existence today (including everything from movies to breakfast cereals), that led to the article that Robert Siegel wrote.

This is also why the article got hundreds of comments from people praising it. Robert Siegel's main point was that ads are not an accident of evolution. As Robert put it, the industry is responsible for ""the advertising of the American experience"".

This is not to suggest that the entire advertising industry is responsible for what we all see on the news, the radio and even the TV. Certainly some of the big advertising companies would like you to believe so; and it's not like they are going to go out of their way to provide a great experience to your computer with a little ad at the bottom of it. However, the big ad businesses are doing quite well in their sales effort against the rest of the media.

For example, one study suggests that in the USA there is enough money to buy 60 billion dollars of media every year. That means that at a conservative estimate, the USA pays around 2.5 trillion dollars every year on advertisement. Of course, there is also money to buy a lot of advertising, and that's a very serious business indeed. Advertising is the source of most of the money that goes into producing and distributing all the music on the radio, video games, and the many other forms of media. This brings us to the next point – we have no problem selling to people when we have free media and we can charge lots of money. The problem is when we don't. It's a very big problem.

This is one of the reasons why all forms of advertising are frowned on by governments and other big organizations. It should be obvious to any fair-minded person, but many people are still very reluctant to go on an ad hunt and have them all to themselves.

But there is"
"How do you define an animal? To some it is a living animal. To others, it is a semi-living animal. To yet others, it is a non-living animal. It doesn't matter what you define an animal as, there's no way you can say that an eagle is not an animal.

Eagles and Golden Eagles in Texas

The Golden Eagle can be found throughout Texas, which makes it one Texas's many endangered species. Some examples of this can be seen in the areas in Horseshoe Bay, Galveston Bay, San Jacinto Pass, Bayshore in Texas, and West Texas. Other examples of the Golden Eagle in Texas can be seen at Camp Hood, in South Texas and near the Bay Bridge and Port Aransas.

The Golden eagle also can be found in many habitats across western states and Mexico. Golden eagles are listed as an endangered species in Arizona and California. Even though the Golden eagle is not listed in Texas, they are still one of the most widespread birds of prey in Texas. They are also able to migrate to South East Asia, New Zealand, Australia, New Guinea and Hawaii, making them an endangered species in both countries.


This article lists some of the famous Golden Eagle in Texas. Check out their list in the section below:

Where does the Golden Eagle come from?

There are several different theories that have been formed about how an eagle got its name. Some believe that it is a combination of the words eagle and golden; others have stated that the word eagle came from a Spanish word that means 'good fortune'. Some believe that it is believed to be the name of a person who brought good fortune to the Native Americans.

Most people believe that the eagle came to America through the early Portuguese settlers and the Spaniards. Another theory is that it might have come by way of Asia and then came to the South East as a result of the slave trade.

Where did one look for the Golden Eagle in Texas?

There are thousands of locations throughout Texas where hunters are able to come and take advantage of these amazing birds.

If you'd like to find more opportunities to hunt the eagles in Texas head over and check out Texas Game & Fish. Not only is this organization a great resource for hunters; but also for anyone who has a passion for Texas and hunting.

For Texas birders and birders-at-large who love hunting; check out the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department – they have their own eagles program for residents.

"The Kanto region of Japan is a very special place for Pokemon fans. It has been home to all kinds of Pokemon throughout the series history, with the first Pokemon ever released in the region being the legendary bird Pokemon, Pidgey. As the Kanto region is home to many of the most famous Pokemon in the series, the region is a great riding ground for Pokemon fans. Some of the most popular Pokemon in the region are a few of the most famous.

Some of the most renowned Pokemon in the Kanto region are:

"The New York Times' ""Op-Ed"" is a particularly timely one. The piece, written by David Brooks in the Sunday edition of the paper, is entitled ""The Last Bastion of Civil Society: The Family"" and it reads as though it was written yesterday.

It is a very good piece. But it could have been written yesterday.

The paper's op-ed page isn't a particularly good place to go if you want to talk about civil society. The paper's op-ed writers tend to have a very particular point of view about civil society. For instance, the paper's Op-Ed page is dominated by Op-Eds by people who are either in the business of making money or who are reasonably convinced that the world is going to hell in a hand basket.

As a result, the op-ed page can be a pretty depressing place to write an opinion piece.

It can be hard to be ""tough on crime,"" for instance. In a recent Op-Ed piece, Brooks said that the debate over how to deal with crime in America is ""obviously a very simple one: More police, more prisons, more punishment, more incarceration, more mandatory minimum sentences, more incarceration, more more.""

One problem with Brooks' argument is that it's based largely on a misunderstanding of the history of the criminal justice system.

In order to understand why he's wrong, we need to look at the history of the criminal justice system.

There's a big difference between being a criminal and being a victim of crime. One might argue that being a victim of crime is far more widespread than being a criminal — but that's not the case. According to the Justice Department, about 90% of all crimes are not committed by the 8.4% of the population who are incarcerated. About 95% of all crimes are committed by people who are not in prison.

The problem is that many Americans are victims of both crime and incarceration. That's because the United States has a huge prison population.

For example, USA Today reports that ""the U.S. has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world."" The report notes that the United States' incarceration rate is more than double that of Canada, which has a much smaller prison population.

The problem is that the United States has a huge prison population.

There are about 2.3 million people in federal and state prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Of these, about 1.6 million are housed in state prisons, which house about 2.1 million inmates.

"[UPDATE] A Blizzard employee has offered some explanation on why some of the characters in Hearthstone remain as they are in the new set.

In an official announcement, Blizzard confirmed that the new, digital card game was going to have no real money transactions.

While the ""new"" card game will in general include no real money sales of virtual goods and, for example, Hearthstone's legendary card will not be in the Collector's Edition, the official Blizzard site does confirm that there will be no real money transactions during Hearthstone's beta phase. This is good news for players who prefer not to play the game's beta on their phone or tablet.

The official release notes also revealed some other elements in Hearthstone that won't change with the free to play beta phase. It's unclear if this means that some character classes will have a different look or will all have the same appearance in the real world. The only other difference is the card backs. Most characters, like the Death Knight, Priest, and Mage will have their hero portraits appear on the card backs but characters like the Druid and Hunter will instead have their portraits appear on their cards.

No real-world Hearthstone beta will be taking place this week due to ""technical issues,"" according to Blizzard. But the new card game is launching on Android, iOS, Mac, PC/Mac, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 3."
"In the last few months, I've been watching a little known YouTube channel called S.M.A.I.L.E. that is about the occult. It's a video, like a documentary on the occult that takes you through some bizarre, disturbing experiences that supposedly reveal something that only a occultist would know.

S.M.A.I.L.E is run by Paul (whose name is not revealed), a former Mormon whose ""spiritual journey"" led him into what appears to be an occult circle or group that promotes the belief that a few select members are destined to live as gods in heaven. He claims that a handful of people are chosen to be such gods, not just any mortals, or even a church, but chosen people who have to undergo a ""ritual experience"" and ""sacrifice"" themselves, the entire body and soul, over and over and over again to become gods. After that, the people who have this ""ritual access"" take on the physical body (of their chosen god, if they had one) or die to become gods themselves.

What's interesting and disturbing about this is that Paul claims his own god is Lucifer. In fact, he doesn't make it clear who he thinks the ""heavenly beings"" are so that nobody will question the authenticity of this experience. And even if people doubt his story, he says that ""they will repent, because Jesus was their savior and they were the only ones to stand with Jesus on the Cross and be his witnesses."" This is a claim that sounds far-fetched and unlikely even when it's based on nothing more than what seems to be a really weird belief system.

But if you can believe it to be true, it's not that hard to believe that this could be the ""secret"" of salvation and eternal life, the true and living God.

I'm no stranger to conspiracy theories myself. I've heard similar stories that can be easily disproven, but I can't ignore that there's a certain element of truth in what Paul is saying. I also feel sure of at least one thing: there will be plenty of believers who believe their belief system, like Paul's, will be the one true God. At any rate, the occult is not as strange as it might first seem.

We do have strange beliefs in the Bible. A quick way to begin is with some of the strange beliefs in the Old Testament. In fact, you can pick up just about any Bible, and you can find all sorts of odd concepts. But what's notable about a couple of Bible stories is that the Bible itself, the Bible, as it's most commonly used, doesn't exactly cover everything you find in a book that might not always be ""in the Bible."" For instance, I've only recently seen a book titled ""The Secret of Freemasons"" by James P. Dickey, who has a degree"
"The Netherlands is trying to get back on track after a disappointing Euro 2016 campaign, with a new tactic of keeping the ball, a footballing philosophy that many believe is the key to victory.

The Dutch played at a more attacking, quick tempo in their opening group game against the Czech Republic and they looked like a side who could have a real chance of qualifying for the knockout stages.

However, they were comprehensively outplayed by a Czech side who, for the first time in the tournament, took the lead, then won the game.

""We want to be as fast as our opponent, to move the ball as quickly as possible and to play fast,"" said coach Danny Blind, who is tasked with curbing the Dutch's lingering failure of passing the ball.

""We have a more attacking style and we want to keep the ball when we can. We don't want to give the ball away, but we need to play quicker and more technically. We have to run at opponents, go at them and use our athleticism.

""We have a very good coach, who wants to play a very attacking style.""

The Dutch played at a different speed to their opponents in the opening game against the Czech Republic.

They were easier to manage in possession, but often struggled to find any rhythm and had little penetration in behind the opposition defence.

This is not something they are likely to be able to reproduce in the second leg of their last-16 tie against either Russia or Wales.

""It is very difficult to play against a team who are so aggressive,"" said Netherlands midfielder Wesley Sneijder. ""They are strong and they are very difficult to play against.""

The Dutch, who have taken four points from their opening two group games, will be hoping to improve on their performance against the Czech Republic.

They will be aiming to prevent a repeat of the embarrassing 1-0 loss to hosts Ukraine when they visited the Stade de France in Paris in 2014.

Sneijder, who scored the winning goal in that defeat, said: ""If we have the same mindset in this game, then it is possible.""

Blind has a lot of faith in his players in this area, as he believes a more attacking style of football will see them progress more quickly.

""We want to be strong, physically and mentally,"" he said. ""We want to show the world that we can play physically and we are ready for the challenge. There are no excuses. We have to make sure we play well.""

The Dutch are already without injured players like midfielder Wesley Sneijder and defender Daryl Janmaat.

Sneijder has a hamstring injury that has kept him out of training. It is expected he will miss this game as well.

Meanwhile, Janmaat has a knee problem that has kept him out of training for almost a"
"The following article was written by Andrew Brace and originally appeared on the official site of the U.S. House of Representatives.

""The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is a political front group that brings together elected legislators and corporate special interests to craft and promote'model' legislation. Over the years, it has been a powerful force behind bills designed to roll back labor rights and weaken regulation on corporations.""

— Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.)

You'd be forgiven for failing to recognize this statement, if you only looked at the headlines and headlines alone.

""ALEC,"" like ""Deregulation,"" has become a political dirty word. The term may have lost relevance after an unsuccessful attempt to repeal ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" in 2011, but it has been used so often in 2012 that it was even featured in TV ads on both sides of the aisle in the presidential election.

On Monday, the Michigan state Supreme Court upheld a 2011 decision upholding a ban on corporate money for ballot initiatives in the state. This is an important victory, given that the anti-corporate funding ban represented only the latest effort by the ALEC board to undercut democracy via special interest lobbying before citizens (e.g., Michigan's citizens).

But the ban was only the most prominent instance in which ALEC has worked to undermine democracy at the state level. ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and ALEC's agenda for state legislatures have been featured in more than 100 investigative reports since the group was founded in 1973.

As a member of ALEC, you can help protect workers, the environment and democratic institutions by refusing funding from this dangerous organization."
"The following is not a complete list of the books in the Ender's Game series. These books are collected in Ender's Library.

All the books in this series were published by Orson Scott Card at Tor Books and they are listed as follows: Ender's Game (1984), The Stone Sky (1986), Foundation (1992), Wolves Among the Shepherds (2000), The Gathering (2002), and The Devil's Chariot (2011).

Ender's Game and Foundation in the Ender's Game series

Ender's Game

Ender's Game was released in 1984 by Orson Scott Card and is a sequel book to Ender's Game. The sequel focuses on Ender Wiggin, who is not the child that was chosen to become the first Master of Ceremonies in Ender's Game.

Ender's Game is a very important and well known part of science fiction literature. It is considered one of the most important books of the 20th century. It has been adapted into an animated movie called Ender's Game, as well as a comic strip series written and illustrated by Robert Orci, and it was adapted and made into a video game for the video game console known as the Nintendo Wii.

The book's success has led to many spin-off series, both on television and in film. The movie was so popular that a second movie is currently being considered for production titled Ender's Game: The Movie.

It has been adapted into movies, video games, and an animated video game called Ender's Game: Origins. In 2011 a video game was released, titled Ender's Game: Origins.

Foundation

Ender's Game (or Ender's Game: War Zones) was released in 1986 by Orson Scott Card and is a sequel book to Ender's Game. The sequel focuses on a team of children who escape an enemy's prison camp in a spaceship using the Ender Wiggin identity. They must then escape the hostile alien world of Formos as well as the alien planet Formos in the Starpath to become spacefaring heroes.

Foundation is considered to be the first sequel book to Ender's Game, and it focuses on a group of refugees who have also escaped the planet Formos. However, this group is not the one that was chosen to become the first Master of Ceremonies in Ender's Game. This group escapes and arrives in Earth with the help of the EarthGov spaceship Persephone. The book was also adapted into a movie, called Ender's Game: Origins.

The second movie, Ender's Game: Origins took place almost three months after the story in the first book. This movie is the first time that scenes from the Ender books have appeared in the movie. In the movie, the crew of Persephone has become the heroes of the battle against an alien force known as the Formics.

"A new study by researchers from the Center for Sexual Health Promotion (CSHP), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the University of Michigan shows that current HIV prevention messages have been poorly targeted at those at greatest risk of infection, including young Latinos and African-Americans.

""HIV prevention messages have been focused almost exclusively on gay and bisexual men, but the majority of new HIV infections in the U.S. are now among men who have sex with men, including Latino men and women,"" said C. Christine Fair, Ph.D., lead author of the study, which was published in the journal AIDS Prevention. ""We found that messages targeting young Latinos and African-Americans were likely to be ineffective and that messages targeting all men who have sex with men were likely to be costly to those who need it most.""

The researchers surveyed over 1,500 Latino and African-American men between the ages of 18 and 29 to assess whether current HIV prevention messages were effective at reducing new HIV infections among young men. While the overall results showed promising results, the authors note that the majority of the study participants (58 percent) were white, and most of those who had sex with men did not receive a single HIV prevention message.

""Our findings suggest that if you want to reduce the high rates of HIV infection among young men who have sex with men, you need to target the messages to men who have sex with men, not just gay men,"" said Dr. Fair. ""It could save lives.""

The findings also suggest that ""advocates may need to re-examine the relative importance of messages targeting Latinos and African-Americans,"" said lead author Dr. William Schaffner, M.D., director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Schaffner and his colleagues had previously studied the effectiveness of HIV prevention messages focusing on gay and bisexual men. The new study provides crucial data showing that HIV prevention messages are not reaching young Latinos and African-Americans as they should.

The researchers found that young Latino men and African-Americans who had sex with men were less likely to receive HIV prevention messages if they were white or Latino, or if they had only had sex with men, and were more likely to receive a primary prevention message if they were Latino or African-American.

""Because young men who have sex with men are at greatest risk for acquiring HIV, we saw that messages focused on gay and bisexual men were most effective at reducing new HIV infections among young men who have sex with men, but are least effective at reducing new HIV infections among Latinos and African-Americans,"" said Dr. Fair. ""Of course, the message needs to be tailored to a person's sexual behavior, so that it's effective for all people who have sex with men, whether or not they are gay or bisexual.""

"Ramallah, Palestine (CNN) The fate of the United States' vital relationship with Israel is the subject of intense debate in the region, especially after the Trump administration's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

The choice has added an interesting twist to a tense and still unresolved conflict that has seen an uptick in violence in the last year, as well as a series of deadly terror attacks

The US Embassy in Tel Aviv and the US Consulate in Jerusalem were both hit by firebombings last month, just weeks before Trump's announcement.

The embassy was badly damaged and the Consulate badly damaged.

But a question that Trump's decision has raised is: ""Is Jerusalem the capital of Israel?""

It's now clear that the answer is ""yes.""

""The United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,"" Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell said Sunday. ""It's the capital of Israel, it's the seat of Israel's government, it's the home of Israel's parliament, it's the seat of Israel's Supreme Court. And we are going to continue to make that clear.""

But the question is whether the US should recognize the city as the capital of Israel in recognition of the city's ancient Jewish history.

""I don't think it's the right question to be asking at this point,"" said Josh Ruebner, a professor at the University of North Carolina who specializes in Middle East politics. ""The question is what does Jerusalem look like to the Palestinians?""

""What the Palestinians in the West Bank can't accept is that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,"" Ruebner said. ""They want control over the ethnic, religious and political issues, they want to be able to decide who is the mayor, the mayor of the municipality, the mayor of the city.""

""They are not going to accept that the capital of Israel is a place where they can't exercise their rights.""

The US government recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The US does not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.

The speculation about who should be the capital of Palestine has long been a contentious issue in the Middle East, where the borders between Israel and Palestine are not clear. The issue has been a sensitive one since the 1930s, when the British Mandate of Palestine was established.

The Palestinians have long argued that the capital of their newly-independent state should be in eastern Jerusalem, which is home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

And even before the current conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the issue was the subject of heated debate in the region.

For years, Palestinian leaders have argued that the international community should recognize East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent Palestine.

But the Israeli government and the international community have always rejected the position, arguing that East Jerusalem is simply part of Israel.

"The World of Warcraft Auction House is a single-player game service that allows you to buy, sell, trade, and modify items in-game. No auction house is complete without the ability to sell and buy items in game, which has been the primary way to get items for a long time.

Since the release of patch 3.2 in August 2010, the Auction House has been revamped and expanded upon, and is now a much more convenient and robust service. It also includes a number of new features, including the Auction House text interface, the ability to assign characters to a service account, and the ability to use the auction house to trade items in game.

The Auction House is currently not available on mobile devices.

Contents show]

Auction House text interface Edit

Trade agents Edit

When you open the auction house, your character's name is automatically sent to the Trade agent. The Trade agent will then tell you what items you can sell or buy, and you can then easily trade items or gold with the person selling or buying. You can also use the Trade agent to check the prices on other players' items, and to find out the current stock of items on the auction house.

If you are a member of a guild, you may also use the Trade agent to check the prices of items on the auction house for your guild.

To assign characters to a service account, go to your character's page on the website, click the Account tab, and select the Service Account option.

You can assign up to 10 characters to a service account, and they will all be able to use the Auction House. If you assign more than 10 characters to a service account, their total gold and items will be capped at 10,000,000 gold.

Buying items Edit

To purchase items on the auction house, you need to have some gold and a service account. To purchase items, you click on the Buy button, and then type in the price of the item. For example, let's say you want to buy a level 75 weapon for 2 gold. You click on the Buy button and type in 2 gold. The item appears in your inventory. If you want to buy more than one item, type more than one price in the box. To cancel the buy order, select the ""Cancel Buy Order"" button.

You can set the trade duration to anywhere between 5 to 99 minutes, and you can also set the price for the item, and your maximum number of items. If the item is a rare item, you can set the trade duration to any value between 0 and 99 minutes, and you can also set the price for the item. (Rare items are those that appear in the Auction House as a golden color.)

To set the trade duration, click on the trade duration button, and then select the desired trade duration. The trade duration is a"

The Daggerfall Chronicles

I.

It was late in the year 4E 201, and the province of Black Marsh was seen by the rest of the Empire as a threat to its very existence.

In the spring of 4E 201, rumors had begun to spread that Morrowind was about to fall, and the Empire was at a loss as to how to stop it. The Emperor had sent emissaries to the three great Dunmer nations of Morrowind, Black Marsh, and Skyrim, to try and find a way to turn back the tide, but none of the emissaries returned.

The Emperor was not to be discouraged, though. Having recently killed the previous emperor, he was determined to see his accomplishments through to their conclusion, and he needed to see the destruction of Morrowind as early as possible. The emissaries returned, but they were unable to persuade the Emperor to send his armies to Morrowind to fight the Dunmer.

The Emperor was in no mood to wait, and in his new year, 4E 202, he called upon the Empress Charlene to become his new ""Minthe Empress.""

II.

It was the end of the fourth year of Charlene's reign, 4E 202, when the Emperor sent the Empress a copy of the Red Book of Riddle-and-Delight, a book of strange and forbidden spells that promised to grant the reader great powers. The Empress was skeptical, as she did not think the Emperor would be able to open the book without her knowledge. But then he did.

The book had been hidden away in the Imperial Library since the Emperor took power, and it was only then that the Empress realized that its pages had been carefully embossed with the Emperor's face, and that it had been written with his own hand. After reading the book, the Empress was able to see the truth of it.

The book was called the ""Red Book of Riddle-and-Delight,"" and it was the work of the ancient Dunmer mage, Wulfharth. The Emperor had read of Wulfharth's deeds, and had seen the signs of his power that had appeared in the Emperor's face.

In Wulfharth's words, he was the ""Maneater,"" and the ""Maneater"" had been born to become the ""Bane of the Empire."" Wulfharth stated that he had been waiting for the time to act, and in the year 4E 201, he had finally come.

The spell, which had been written by Jagar Tharn, was a ""transmutation spell,"" and like other spells, it required a powerful source of mass to be cast. The spell had been cast into a newly created staff, and its power spread throughout the Empire. The spell's effect was immediate"
"""In fact, the worst thing that can happen is for someone to be a little bit less than perfect, but that is not the case here,"" said Mr. Eshoo, who added that the federal agency was completing its investigation in ""as rapid a fashion as possible.""

""This is a very, very, very, very unique situation,"" he said. ""In the case of the White House, we're talking about the highest office in the land and someone who is very, very well liked by the next president.""

Federal investigators have been looking into the issue for months following reports that Mr. Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, before Trump took office. The conversations were captured on surveillance of the Russian ambassador's conversations with other diplomats. Mr. Flynn resigned in February after he misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation, and a White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said, ""The White House will not comment on the status of any ongoing investigation.""

As Mr. Flynn's troubles continued, the Trump transition team took advantage of his position to recruit officials who would help erase any lingering impressions that Mr. Trump's team would be beholden to him.

In March, Trump transition officials reached out to Georgia Congressman Tom Price, a fellow Republican, who was then the head of the House Budget Committee. The White House and transition officials talked about Mr. Price's expertise with Medicare and Medicaid, according to people familiar with the discussions."
"How to Become a Better Teacher (and Why)

Posted on by in Education

A better teacher is a better student. In fact, the very best kind of teacher make learning a pleasure. We've all experienced what it's like when a teacher inspires us.

Imagine being in the seat of a teacher who does not only inspire, but who also makes learning that much better. In addition to that, imagine the benefits of a teacher who helps students do even better on standardized tests.

It sounds crazy, right? Well, for some teachers and for some teachers only. What does it truly take to become one of the best kind of teacher? Is it the same for all students? How can you know if your students are in the ""better"" category for you?

It can be daunting finding out what makes your students a ""better"" teacher and then teaching them. If you're wondering what kind of teacher I am in a particular subject or subject area, check out my top 10 list of teachers in Psychology, or my list of 5 Top Five Psychology Teacher Schools.

The more I've found out about teaching, though, the more I feel that most teaching is an art and not a science.

There are a few common misconceptions that come along with any discussion about teaching, including this:

The best teachers are ""motivators of learning.""

They motivate students by using praise, giving attention time out of class, and putting students in touch with their strengths.

Motivating a student can be challenging; however, most students need to be moved to create a positive environment.

In order to effectively motivate your students, it's important to make sure that you get them actively involved in learning.

A little more on that in a minute.

This post explores the research that goes into a teacher's effectiveness, and how to use this knowledge to improve your classroom. This post also answers the following:

What is the best way to become a better teacher?

How can you find out what makes your students a ""better"" teacher for you?

How can you find out if your students are more effective than your competition?

What is the best way to become a better teacher?

For this post, I wanted to start by asking a question and then dive into more research before answering. I wanted to use a research question that I knew some readers would be interested in. In fact, I started with the question:

How does your students feel about you?

Most teachers have a strong sense of personal esteem, and that can translate into a positive sense of self-worth for some students. So, I asked my students to write out what they think of me. I don't believe that teachers should be afraid to do this, however. Students know their teachers, and that can be a powerful way to build a relationship. In fact"
"The White House has been trying to tamp down on the growing scandal around no-bid contracts for the Department of Health and Human Services.

The administration has been pushing back on reports that the agency awarded contracts to companies with a history of violating regulations and failing to deliver on their promises.

But a New York Times report shows that the administration of President Barack Obama is also trying to silence the growing outcry from lawmakers and the public over the lack of oversight and accountability at HHS.

The Times reported that the White House has asked the National Security Agency to provide information on the companies that won the contracts. The NSA is a US Department of Defense agency that monitors foreign communications.

The NSA declined to explain its request in a statement to the Times.

""NSA's role is to protect the nation and its people from the threat of terrorism,"" the statement said. ""NSA does not have any information regarding the specific companies or individuals that may have been involved in this process.""

The White House and Obama administration officials have been trying to tamp down on the growing scandal.

As the Times reported, the administration of Obama has been trying to stop congressional lawmakers from investigating the HHS contracts and the revolving door between the agency and the private sector.

Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he's concerned about the lack of oversight at HHS.

""I don't know how to explain to my constituents and constituents generally why they should be in a position to approve a contract for $5 million from the president of the United States when we know he hasn't been properly vetted,"" Waxman said.

HHS chief Kathleen Sebelius has also been making the rounds on Capitol Hill to explain how the agency does its business.

""We have a very open, transparent process,"" Sebelius said in a speech at Georgetown University. ""We have a rigorous process, where we look for the best value. We don't look at the politics.""

But a federal judge has ruled that the administration's approval process for HHS contracts is flawed. The case was brought by the Center for Investigative Reporting. The judge, Charles Breyer, ruled that the government must now provide a fuller explanation of how it approves HHS contracts.

""The administration will have to show it has a credible explanation for why it approved these high-priced awards, and why it made them at all, rather than simply accepting the lowest bid,"" Breyer wrote in his ruling.

The case is one of several that have been brought against the agency by investigative journalists and advocacy groups.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"There's a new administration in Washington, and the old guard is flailing.

So far, it's not working.

The White House and Congress are facing a slew of crises, from the lack of a health-care bill to the Trump's executive order banning refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.

""It's a shock,"" said Nellie Bowles, a senior vice president at the pro-immigration non-profit America's Voice. ""We knew they were trying to do something, and we were like, 'What? This can't be.'""

American voters, though, are leading the way.

A survey by the Pew Research Center found that an overwhelming 77 percent of non-white voters approve of Trump's job performance. Overall, white Americans disapprove of Trump's job performance by a wide margin, with just 34 percent approving.

The president ""has a lot of work to do to win back the trust of the American people,"" said Murshed Zaheed, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

The Trump administration has not yet had a good week. A grand jury in Washington, D.C., is expected to decide whether to charge Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos with lying to the FBI about his dealings with Russians. And Trump's national security advisor, Michael Flynn, resigned after the president said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S.

During his first month in office, Trump has been dogged by a series of controversies that have damaged his ability to govern.

Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was leading an investigation into whether Trump's campaign had links to Russia's election meddling.

Then, Trump said he had been wiretapped by the Obama administration during the election.

Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., released emails that suggested he was willing to accept Russian assistance to help Trump win the White House.

In the wake of the scandal, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is calling for the Senate to conduct a special investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the presidential election.

Trump has suggested that he may fire Mueller, his special counsel, and has been publicly critical of the FBI and Department of Justice for not investigating his campaign.

And then there's the Russian dossier, which claims that Trump and his associates were involved in the Kremlin's efforts to influence the election. The alleged dossier, which was compiled by a former British intelligence agent, has never been substantiated."

"One of the most seductive stories of the past few years has been the rise of the group of young conservative activists who have become known as the ""Tea Party."" The Tea Party is a major driving force behind the radical right-wing agenda in Washington, and it has been able to accomplish this feat largely because of the shameless, opaque behavior of the mainstream media.

Last spring, when the Tea Party was gaining momentum, the Washington Post's Dana Milbank appeared to ridicule the movement by suggesting that Tea Party organizers were likely to ""turn out to be little more than a cult.""

Milbank's comments are illustrative of the media's attitude toward the Tea Party. The media has consistently portrayed Tea Party activists as unpatriotic, ignorant, ignorant, uneducated, uneducated, un-American, and un-American. And, in general, the media has treated Tea Party activists as a direct threat to the country, and as a group whose supporters are ready to explode at a moment's notice.

But what if the Tea Party is not a cult, but a movement that has managed to gain considerable ground in all major American cities over the past several years? What if the Tea Party is an important force in the country's political landscape, one that is beginning to change the way our nation is governed?

Consider the national polls this past summer, in which Tea Party supporters were shown to be just as likely as other Americans to vote for President Obama.

Consider the fact that the Tea Party has been able to gain so much traction in the political realm despite the media's treatment of the movement as an unpatriotic fringe group.

Consider the fact that the Tea Party has been able to successfully launch an aggressive grassroots campaign to elect Republican candidates, most notably in state and local elections.

Consider the fact that the Tea Party has gone from being a fringe movement to having national political clout.

Consider the fact that the Tea Party has been able to successfully influence the direction of the Republican Party by winning over influential members of the party's establishment, including some of the most powerful Republicans in the country.

As the new Rice University president, David Leebron said he will stay focused on the future, but he did not take a hint of the challenges ahead.

""We've been in the business of research for a long time. It's what we do,"" Leebron said in an interview with the USA TODAY Network after being appointed to lead Rice. ""It's somebody who gets very excited about the future and there's a lot of work that needs to be done.

""But I'm not going to be distracted by the past,"" he said. ""I'm going to continue to focus on the future.""

Since Leebron was appointed in January, he has been leading the university on a strategic plan that includes becoming a research institution.

""There are still some things we need to do at Rice. And I think that's one of the reasons why I'm here,"" Leebron said. He called himself ""a planner"" who will look at Rice's strengths and make sure it gets what it needs to be successful.

A native of Texas, Leebron is a former governor who served two five-year terms as governor of Texas.

"The first time I ever saw the word ""gay,"" it was in a comic book for kids.

""The Pride of Taos,"" a six-page strip from the 1970s, included a scene at the end of the book where a middle-aged woman's ex-husband has just been dumped by his new girlfriend. The girl wants him back. Her ex answers in the negative. The guy shrugs. ""What's the point?""

""She wants him to leave! How's she a woman? How do I know she's a woman? That's what gay women are for.""

I wasn't sure whether to laugh or curse, but I was also so taken back by the thought that that it made me feel both. Gay women, in particular, were, like, such a weird group. What, exactly, made those women more interesting than heterosexual women?

It wouldn't be until the early 2000s, when my queer and LGBTQI friends would be making a habit of speaking to me about their sexual identities and the way in which their sexuality had been shaped during childhood, that I realized where that kind of thinking was coming from. And the answer was pretty clear. Growing up, we were always encouraged to view everyone else's gender and sexual identities through the lens of a gender-conforming-to-the-norm narrative. As women were so often assigned roles that were stereotypically stereotypically woman-like, it didn't make sense to question the existence of women.

That was a powerful lesson I learned growing up. But then it suddenly felt more like I was hearing it from parents. My friends were telling me that I was ""not a lesbian."" It was only later that I would discover that not all lesbians were, or ever were, the same as I was.

I've grown up now. Now I know my friends' identities. They exist. And my queer and LGBTQI friends know mine. It makes sense; you can't get much more personal than this. And it's so refreshing to be around people who are so comfortable living their authentic life.

The idea of someone being gay is no longer a surprise. It's a natural evolution of identity, and is one with which most people have no problem. As more Americans come out each year, it's becoming a more common thing for people to talk about, and so, as a whole, the number of people who identify as openly gay has grown. Now that I know there is a category of people I fit into, it makes me feel less alone.

And it also means that I get to watch other people in my gender and sexual expression in the same way that I get to watch people in the categories of disability or race or disability identification. It means that while gay people are the minority of the minority, we're also a minority of the majority. And now they recognize me.

"Hair loss, skin problems or baldness are a few of the causes of acne. Many people want to see signs of acne on their skin before they visit a doctor. Here are six methods that can help you recognize the first signs of acne.

1. Take a look around your home

Did you know your home is likely to harbor an acne outbreak on your skin? The number of people who develop acne in their childhood, teens and young adulthood is significantly higher than for other ages.

A new study published in Preventive Medicine showed that people with acne in the family were four times more likely to develop it later in life than those who never had it.

Another study in this month's Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology showed that the closer an acne outbreak is to the hair follicle, the higher the risk of it becoming an acne scar.

2. Look inside your mouth


If you already have acne, it's likely to flare up again. A study in the Journal of Dermatological Surgery found that women with scarring on their mouths had acne more often than those with no scars.

Some of the most common causes of scarring on your face include the following:

Acne at the sides of your eye

Overgrowth of hair follicles

Overgrowth of dead skin cells

When you look inside your mouth, you can see that some of the most common growths are pimples, blackheads and whiteheads. Blackheads and whiteheads are generally self-limiting, and do not need to be cut out. You should remove these growths with a scalpel.

A common blackhead removal technique includes shaving it off with a blade and cleaning the cut area immediately with a mild soap and water to minimize the risk of bacteria being introduced into your mouth.

3. Take a peek under your eyes


A study published in the journal of American Women's Dermatology showed that people suffering from acne face a significant risk for eye infections.

The researchers found that nearly half of the women with acne had visible signs of infection with bacteria, and that some of them had experienced up to 25 percent decrease in quality vision over the first few days of being treated.

One of the main reasons for eye infections, often bacterial in nature, is due to the fact that you're often unable to effectively clean your eyelids due to redness. To solve this problem, your doctor may suggest using eye drops to remove the infection and improve the results of the treatment.

4. Use soap to take care of your scalp

When you look at your skin under the microscope, you'll easily notice that a majority of pimples are caused by dead skin cells. This is due to your sebum being converted into oil by bacteria in your pores.

When you take care of your scalp using soap and a scalp cleansing cream, you'll"
"The United States is poised to dramatically increase its military presence in the Persian Gulf.

The U.S. military is seeking to build up forces on the southern end of the Gulf, to protect Saudi Arabia and to bolster its influence in the region.

The United States already has U.S. Navy ships patrolling the area, and has deployed its own fighter jets and special forces to the region.

These operations are being undertaken under the auspices of the U.S. military's 10-year, $600 billion military modernization program, which was approved by Congress last year.

The US military's plans call for the creation of a global network of military bases across the region to protect its interests.

The U.S. military is currently building up its presence in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

The current plan includes the establishment of a naval base in Bahrain, which would allow the deployment of U.S. Navy ships and aircraft.

The plan also calls for the construction of a naval facility on the Gulf of Oman.

The United States and Saudi Arabia have been at odds over the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the U.S. has been accused of supporting extremism in the region with arms sales and funding.

The Pentagon has also been accused of carrying out covert operations in the region.

"The latest version of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus is the sixth-generation iPhone, and it has a new, amazing feature called Touch ID. And, thanks to a new study, it's one of the most secure types of passwords.

The study, conducted by the University of Michigan, found that Touch ID passwords are much more difficult to crack than passwords that are associated with other forms of authentication, such as the password ""123456.""

Touch ID has been expanding as Apple has pushed for and expanded the feature in the past few years. In fact, it's the new feature that makes the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus the most secure smartphones on the market.

For a long time, Touch ID was one of the hardest passwords to crack. But as the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have grown in popularity, the number of laptops that have been cracked has been increasing.

Apple's new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus both include a fingerprint sensor. And for years, the iPhone has been the most secure smartphones on the market. For example, the phone was able to protect about 99% of passwords in a recent study. But now it's the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus that are the most secure.

This is a huge upgrade over the previous iPhone models, which asked users to type a convoluted password and a PIN to gain access to the phone. The same study found that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are much more difficult to crack than passwords that are associated with other forms of authentication, such as the password ""123456.""

In addition, Touch ID is much more secure than the passcodes that are associated with banking accounts. Before Apple added Touch ID, the iPhone 6s was the most secure of all smartphones. Now, it's the most secure smartphone on the market.

Touch ID is a great feature for Apple's security, but it's not the only way to secure a smartphone. Password-based authentication systems such as Google's Authenticator app and Facebook's Login with Facebook app are also incredibly secure.

The study was conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan and the University of California, San Diego. The researchers used a machine learning algorithm to analyze the passwords that were used to unlock the phones.

The researchers were able to identify which passwords were easier to crack than other passwords, as well as which passwords were used in other apps on the phones.

They found that the most common passwords discovered were ""password,"" ""123456"" and ""password."" And the least common passwords were ""raspberry,"" ""thetaytay,"" ""123456"" and ""12345678.""

The study found that passwords that were used with other apps on the phone were less likely to be difficult to crack. But passwords that were used with the iPhone app Touch ID were most likely to be"
"RALEIGH, NC - Ron Francis, Executive Vice President and General Manager of the National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes, today announced that the team has agreed to terms on a two-year contract extension through the 2017-18 National Hockey League season. As part of the agreement, the team has agreed to terms on a three-year contract extension with Hurricanes' captain Eric Staal (2014-17).

Under the new deal, Staal will make $6.25 million in 2014-15 and $7.5 million in 2015-16.

In 2014-15, Staal ranked second among active NHL players with 44 points (16-22=44). Staal, who had his first career 10-goal, 19-point game (Oct. 13 vs. Boston) on Oct. 9 against Boston, helped the Hurricanes (28-23-7, 62 points) earn the franchise's second winning season in franchise history, and also recorded his fifth-straight 20-goal season and first since 2011.

Since the beginning of the 2011-12 campaign, Staal ranks third in the League (behind only Steven Stamkos and Rick Nash) in game-winning goals (7), assists (54) and points (107) while registering consecutive years of 20-plus goals. In the 2012-13 season, Staal led all players in points (70) and goals (32) and ranked second in game-winning goals (8).

During the 2013-14 season, Staal set career highs in goals (27), assists (45) and points (62). Staal also established a new career high in goals per game (1.22) with 11 goals and 27 points as the Hurricanes finished third in the Southeast Division. Staal's three-year contract extension includes a base salary of $7,125,000 this past season, plus a $100,000 signing bonus and performance bonuses.

Following the conclusion of the 2014-15 season, Staal will enter the final year of his entry-level contract and begins the upcoming campaign with a cap hit of $5,875,000."
"The New York Jets have a lot of quality depth at defensive end, and a lot of young talent, but what they need is more consistency from their line rotation.

The Jets have depth at defensive end across the board, but they're not getting it done.

The Jets have started the season with a revolving door at defensive end. Ryan Clady has been nursing an injury, and he's the only experienced player on the roster. Lorenzo Mauldin and Muhammad Wilkerson have been inconsistent, while Quinton Coples is struggling to find consistency.

The Jets are finally starting to get it done, however, with rookie Sheldon Richardson playing more consistently. Richardson has played every game at defensive end, and has been a disruptive presence on the defensive line. Richardson is now in the top 10 of the league in sacks, and has a team-best five sacks.

Vance Walker has been solid on the edge, but Richardson has been the biggest difference maker, and he's a big reason why the Jets have won three in a row.

""He's the best pass rusher we have,"" said Jets defensive coordinator Kacy Rodgers. ""He's not only the best pass rusher we have, he's the best defensive linemen we have for a reason. He's one of the top pass rushers in the league. He fits the scheme. He fits the way we play. He fits the way we train. He fits the way we practice. I think there's a reason why we are 6-2.""

The Jets have a defense that has been playing great football, but they still need a couple more players to step up and be reliable pass rushers and part of the rotation.

After playing 38 snaps last week, Wilkerson had just 14 snaps in the Jets' Week 6 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, and he was only able to record one tackle. The Jets need more consistency out of Wilkerson, and they need to get him on the field more.

Mauldin was on the field for just 28 snaps, and he had a sack and a hurry in the win over the Eagles, but he looked uncomfortable, as if he was not quite sure how to use his hands. He is not a player who wins against the run or the pass, but he has been an asset on the edge, and he should be able to help Richardson get his first sack of the season.

Muhammad Wilkerson has had a quiet start to the season, but he has shown flashes of greatness. (USATSI)

There's a lot to like about Richardson, and it's not as if the Jets are putting him in bad situations. Richardson has been used in the same scheme as Leonard Williams, who is a good player, but Richardson has not been as overwhelmed with the responsibilities of being the team's best player.

The Jets also have a talented group of defensive"
"The recent announcement of the extension of the HSR (High Speed Rail) project in India through the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) shows that the project is not just stalled, but is also headed for a complete collapse.

The NHAI has already taken huge financial risk for the project on the basis of the erroneous cost estimates provided by the UPA government. Now, it has gone wide with its proposal to extend the project by another five years, from the original deadline of 2026. The extension, in fact, is being done with all the casualness of an expansion of the Metro railway network.

That has led to widespread concerns that the project is now at a standstill, and that the NHAI is willing to sacrifice the very future of the country in order to achieve a political, economic and even personal agenda. The HSR project is not just a huge, long-term investment, but a great legacy for India, which has many benefits, not just for its citizens, but also for the world.

The HSR is a project that has an incredible impact on all of us. It is an opportunity for India to prove to the world that it is a modern economy. It is a project that will turn India into a modern nation. It will help India become a hub for knowledge and technology, and will transform it into a manufacturing and services hub.

India has the potential to become a manufacturing powerhouse for the world. The country has the most advanced infrastructure in the world, and it has the skills to transform its population. The country has a huge potential to become one of the leading economies in the world. It is time to seize the opportunity and build the HSR.

The Grand Challenge

The HSR project was conceived by the late Rajiv Gandhi in 1986 as a great opportunity to show the world that India was indeed a modern and dynamic country.

It was a grand challenge to be met by the leadership of the time, and indeed, the leadership of the country. In the early years of the project, the Government of India was not only unwilling to fund the project, but it was also uninterested in the project. The project was not seen as a priority, as a priority was seen as a luxury.

This was a huge mistake. The HSR could have been a huge opportunity for India. The project could have been a shining example of what a modern and dynamic country could become. However, the leadership of the country was unwilling to take the project forward, and it was not taken forward by the Government of India.

In fact, in the early years, in the 1990s, the NDA government actually threatened to declare the project as a national disaster, thus making it impossible for any private developer to develop the project. In fact, the NDA government even went so far as to declare the project as a national disaster in 1998, which was"
"An international team of researchers has been studying the life history of these animals, found in the cold reaches of the Antarctic waters, and they are calling for better protection for the animals from ocean warming.

When temperatures rise too quickly and the animals do not have access to enough water (to conserve energy), the survival chances decrease considerably according to research published in this month's issue of The Field Zoologist.

This is the first time that researchers have studied the impact of warming ocean waters on Antarctic crustaceans living at depths of more than 1,000 meters - called ""oceanic inhabitants"".

""The fact that a marine-life species like the Antarctic crustaceans is exposed to the ocean for a long time and is highly vulnerable to ocean warming suggests that we need to focus our attention on preserving populations of such species from future ocean warming,"" said study leader Dr. Tore Huisman, a research scientist at the Centre for Ecological Research at the University of Oslo.

The team studied the growth of the creatures and its response to increased ocean temperatures. These findings reveal for the first time that Antarctic crustaceans, so-called mesopelagic crustaceans or ""mesofauna"" as they are known in the scientific literature, are affected by oceanic warming even at the sea surface.

Since the 1960s, studies suggest that Antarctic crustaceans adapt, living in colder waters and feeding only in their preferred habitat. Over the past four decades, these animals have undergone a remarkable change with their growth rate falling by 10 percent and then disappearing completely in some areas.

The current study examines the current situation and how it may influence future generations. The researchers used a high-resolution sonar network on the Norwegian Polar Institute (Finnmark) to record the animals' movements and to record the changes in the depth of the ocean where the creatures lived at the end of 2010. The results revealed that the animals are still there, they are merely less abundant than they were before.

""There is a concern that as these mesonaut species are able to maintain their populations on the surface of the ocean, we may no longer be able to see them and that this will prevent our ability to provide better fisheries management for these animals,"" said Dr. Henrik Carlsen, a researcher from the Fennsmark Arctic Observatory.

In the future, we need to take measures that will prevent this species from disappearing altogether, the scientists said. While scientists do not know what the future holds when it comes to marine life, the findings indicate that the marine ecosystem is still evolving and should be protected."
"There are two ways to read it:

(1) A statement indicating that the President was aware of and approved a proposal to kill his wife.

(2) An admission by the President that he approved the killing.

In the second case, it's a direct admission.

There are two ways to read that statement:

(1) It would appear that Obama knew of and approved of the proposal and it was a joint decision, and

(2) it would appear that Obama approved of the killing and authorized the action but was still acting in the capacity of Commander-in-Chief, and the action was therefore legal.

The second interpretation is a very compelling one, and probably the best that any president can hope for in light of the law.

But in the first interpretation, it isn't so cut and dry. We have to look again at the circumstances that led to an attack.

If Obama wasn't aware of the plan, had he, or was he still acting in his capacity as commander-in-chief because he knew it was feasible?

That doesn't answer the question. There's a long history in the use of presidential authority involving a decision regarding a drone strike.

In 2009, for example, Obama secretly approved a secret program to kill a U.S. citizen on American soil in ""a manner consistent with the Laws of War"" if a U.S. citizen engaged in a terrorism-related strike in Yemen against U.S. citizens.

That led to a lawsuit by some of the victims' families. The Obama Administration argued unsuccessfully that it was allowed to kill an American citizen on American soil, and didn't need to get a judge's approval or a congressional mandate because it was ""lawful"" under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force.

The judge agreed with them and dismissed the lawsuit, but Obama did not accept the ruling. He instead announced that he planned to take the case to the Supreme Court.

In the end, the Supreme Court ruled against Obama, as it did in the case of al-Awlaki and the targeting of a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, al-Awlaki's son.

That case involved an attack in Yemen, but in the case of al-Awlaki, the attack was on a U.S. air base in Yemen.

At issue in those cases was whether the President was authorized to take out an American citizen on American soil — a decision that Obama had been considering since 9/11 — and that decision would have gone only to the Supreme Court.

Obama did accept the ruling and declined to appeal the case.

On the subject of the Obama Administration's legal reasoning in the killing of Awlaki, here's an excerpt from a recent article in Foreign Policy:

A team of researchers from the University of Michigan has found a way to harness the sun's energy to provide safe, inexpensive and scalable fuel for electric car batteries.

The technology, which was developed in a pilot program with the Michigan Department of Technology (M.D.T.) and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, does so by using sunlight on a much smaller scale than other methods to convert solar energy into electricity. The researchers are now planning to take the technology to the next level by developing it for commercial applications.

""For the first time, we've been able to take the technology to the next level and have a potential to make solar electricity a cost competitive source for powering electric vehicles,"" said David Smith, a professor at M.D.T. and one of the paper's lead authors.

This new approach allows more efficient solar cell conversions in a small space and requires virtually no land, water or construction materials, Smith said. The results are outlined in the paper ""A photovoltaics-based energy storage system with wide application potential.""

""We found that this process uses relatively low input levels of energy to produce a large voltage, which corresponds to the voltage required by a solar-energy system,"" Smith said. ""This may allow for the design of a system that is not limited by space or by the need to store sufficient energy for the next day's use.""

Solar energy is available from the sunlight that hits the top of the plant during the day, Smith explained. To make the conversion work, the electrons from the sunlight are collected and stored in a thin layer of a semiconductor material, such as indium gallium phosphide (InP), for use later in the process.

However, with today's solar panels, the InP can only power about 15 percent of the available electrical power when using the current standard of 3,000 to 8,000 square meters of cell area. So it's not a good use of energy.

In the new design, for instance, a single InP cell measures less than 10 by 10 meters, and it could be placed inside a rectangular metal tank less than five meters wide.

In the tank, the team then uses a ""bio-sun"" technology to harvest the energy captured by the solar-cells with little waste, the result being a relatively large number of cells — about 100 — that can power a large number of electric cars.

""The cells would have to be removed after a day or two (if they are placed outside) and the energy stored, but there could be several weeks of storage that can be used on an intermittent basis,"" Smith said. ""We hope this technology will be broadly available on the market in a matter of years.""

"MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin has signed into law a law that imposes fines for ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations"" among minors.

The new legislation, which takes effect on Friday, requires minors to get parental permission before getting a passport, getting a passport renewal, or applying for a passport to visit another country. The rule could also affect parents of young children who travel with their children.

The law includes fines for minors who make videos or photographs of themselves engaged in sexual acts with other people. It imposes a fine on adults who share nude photos of minors, and fines for minors who play computer games that glorify sex with children.

The law says the information must be made available to minors who ask for it.

The state-controlled news agency, RIA Novosti, reports that the law has provoked a wave of protests in Russia.

""The law is very difficult to understand. It's a bit scary,"" said Marina Alesheva, a protest organizer in Moscow, at the demonstration that drew hundreds of people to the streets of the capital.

She said the law was aimed at prohibiting the spreading of sexually provocative information among minors.

""What they want is to ban the discussion of sexuality,"" she said. ""The problem is that it's called a law on promoting child rights, but it is really a law on finding ways of restricting sexuality.""

Alesheva said she had sought information from the law's authors, who she said didn't want to discuss the law.

""I don't think they have any idea of how important this issue is,"" she said.

In the past, Russia has faced criticism for failing to protect children from sexual abuse.

In June, a young boy was beaten to death and his body burned in a suspected pedophile case in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk.

In 2007, a schoolgirl was raped and her throat slit in Krasnoyarsk and a 17-year-old boy was sentenced to life in prison in the attack.

In August, a 12-year-old girl in the southern city of Stavropol was raped by a group of men.

In January, a 16-year-old girl was gang-raped in the city of Chelyabinsk by five men."
"Troy Brown is the creator of TNA and one half of New Japan Pro Wrestling. Brown is known for his use of comedy as well as comedy as wrestling, with his unique characters bringing in many new people to the wrestling world as well as bringing fresh perspectives to many long standing fans.

After spending the past four years with TNA, Brown has been involved in a controversy surrounding the recent TNA Global Force Wrestling pay-per-view event. The event in which Brown had a character of the late Paul Heyman perform his classic character from ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, which resulted in the former WCW World Heavyweight Champion not being allowed to compete due to not having a license for that type of persona.

I sat down with Troy and talked to him about that controversy.

We all have had our share of backstage drama and what are you thoughts on the situation at hand?

I think it's just funny. They were like, ""He has a license for that kind of character. Let him do it."" They want you to do what you want to do and be what you want to be. That's what life is all about. As long as what you're doing is legal, it doesn't matter what I am or who I am. Let me play what I know how to play, let me play the character, let me do the job for the fans who love me, because they're the ones who are going to live with my decisions and my character.

Do you think the situation could have been handled differently and if you have the opportunity to correct it in future, would you?

No, I don't think they need to go to this extreme and I really can't think of a way for it to be better. It's not a perfect situation, but it's not one I look back on with any regret. I know how that type of situation plays out, and you just do what's best for the people.

When you came to New Japan, what were the main reasons why you chose New Japan over the WWE?

I was looking for something new. I wanted to try something new and it took awhile to find my own voice. I had no idea what it would take before I found my niche in wrestling. I was a little more experienced in Japan due to being active in their scene for so long. I also realized they had a bigger footprint in their market and you had to know the market and understand the characters in order to succeed in the WWE, but I also wanted to find my niche in New Japan before I was able to do that.

"In the past, if you needed to convert data from a web service to a YAML file then you would have created a YAML file and used it with the other files in your project. This works great if you are just dealing with raw data in HTML files but this approach leaves you in a situation when you want to get that data into an YAML file. This is a problem when the conversion happens at build time or when the data needs to be updated for some other reason.

If you are looking for a better way to write YAML files you are in luck. We will introduce yaml.js which is a web framework that allows you to interact with YAML and convert it to JSON, YAML to JSON, JSON to YAML, YAML to HTML and other types of files from within your javascript code.

Using yaml.js you will be able to convert values from some source (e.g. a website or a file) to a YAML file. If you save the converted YAML file to a different location and then reference this file in other scripts or scripts in your page then you will be able to read the values directly from the web service. The example pages included with this tutorial should help you understand how this works.

Let us consider an example page that you create and place in the root directory of the site. This file contains several YAML files. Here is an excerpt from that file:

--- title : Some text contents : Some content url : http://example.com/some-page

To create your own YAML file you just have to use the template function on this file. You can specify a template for any file in the file by writing a key/value pair in the template. For example:

{ # template : some.yaml # template.tpl }

In this example the template function will return a template that starts with some. You can specify any number and type of keys and values you want to include in your YAML file.

If you are not sure which data type to use don't worry about the type. It will automatically make sure that value is of the correct data type. For example:

YAML.string

JSON

YAML.array

YAML.map

YAML.datum

You can also combine keys and values for maximum compatibility, or even define a function inside the template function to help make the most of it.

Let us imagine that you want to return a YAML file that contains a list of some values with the key values. You could do the following:

{ # template : some.yaml # # <some key> # # <value> }

You could also write this as a helper function:

"Hair and skin care products are so essential to keep your hair-and-skateable-looking that we've broken down what everyone should know about how to best clean and care for their skin. There are three types of hair care: shampoo, conditioner, and conditioner and shampooing.

A lot of skaters don't want to spend money on hair products, so there are options to keep your skates squeaky clean without ever being a drain on your wallet. Use our list below to decide if they are right for you:

Shampoo

When you shampoo, you strip the dirt from your hair and rinse away the hair buildup left over from your skaters years of skateboarding. It is important that you use a quality product that contains a full range of shampoos, including sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers. If you do not have an all natural hair product, the best option (in order of value) is the L'Oreal La Roche-Posay Advanced Shampoo and Conditioner that contains all-natural ingredients to control hair product buildup. The L'Oreal Advanced Shampoo and Conditioner works well with all skaters and is the most popular shampoos for skaters in the pros.

Conditioner

When you condition your hair, it works with your shampoo to bring the moisture your skates need and allows it to feel soft. Conditioner is used to condition hair that is not completely shaven, either to help avoid split ends and split ends of split ends to prevent hair breakage and to prevent split ends of cut ends. The best conditioner to use for this and other reasons is the Neutrogena Smooth Operator conditioner, which, when applied as a base to your hair (after shampooing), leaves your hair soft and shiny.

Shampoo and conditioner

Shampoos are what gets your skates clean enough to protect them. They are also the first thing you do when you get home from skating; this includes showering, but for some reason skaters still use conditioners to get their first rinse. Conditioner is used to condition hair and will be the only soap that can be used on the shaved surface of your skates. It is a wash that contains a full range of shampoos and conditioners. However, there are also products that will work on this surface without conditioner, but without leaving a shiny residue. You can use the following products to get your skates squeaky clean without leaving product on the shaved surface of your skates:

Body wash

Body sprays

Oils


Conditioner and shampoo

These are the products that clean the surface of your skates and leave them clean. They are also what you use to get your skates clean. Conditioner and shampoo leave a clean finish on the surface of your skates.

"The United States has""sucked,"" as George Will has put it (and as my colleague Peter Suderman puts it in his new book, The Second Obama Term), for what has become a global financial crisis. We did not do so on President Bush's watch (although his policies did contribute to the crisis). The Obama administration's response was to increase spending and deficit spending, especially of the kind known as quantitative easing—creating money in the banking system and transferring it into the economy—and to push for a new approach to economics, ""liberals"" being the new name for ""neoconservatives."" The result—a record $11 trillion in new federal debt over ten years. And the record was even worse than that in the case of the Bush administration, in which the $400 billion stimulus had to be doubled, the Social Security Administration cut in half, and the Bush tax cut for the wealthy was extended two years longer. We are back at the $4 trillion mark.

But as a matter of relative terms, this is no worse than the deficit over this period under every recent Republican president. Bush's $9 trillion in new debt from 2003 to 2008 was more or less in line with presidents at the beginning of the Reagan and subsequent administrations. And when President Clinton signed off on that ""grand bargain"" deficit reduction package in 1997, it created a surplus, as the Congressional Budget Office reports, with half a trillion dollars of additional spending projected to take effect in 2001 (in addition, of course, to the other spending and tax increases that the Clinton administration approved). Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush (and President Bush II) all pursued deficit reduction—all except Mr. Bush. In the decade before taking office, the economy grew by about a third, but under Mr. Bush those growth rates fell to near zero.

The question is why, then, do people believe that the current Administration, led by an ""outsider""—an African-American, a woman, a Hispanic, someone from Asia (or, apparently, a gay man)—is somehow fundamentally different than the previous Republican-led ones? Perhaps because of those early Republican Presidents' own self-conscious efforts to show how ""sensible"" they were. As it happens, the Obama Administration has shown exactly that: it has done exactly what the Republican predecessors did before them. Mr. Suderman's book is a detailed examination of how government has dealt with the Great Depression, and how that response differs from that taken by earlier administrations. But the core story that it tells is similar to that told, in a general way, by every Republican President of the last half century or so.

Mr. Bush saw it as a challenge to his ideology, and the nation's strength, to balance the budgets; to rein back the power of government; to cut taxes. So what does he do? He gives the Federal Reserve much more power. Mr. Obama has increased the power"
"In his opening salvo in an op-ed piece for The Hill, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff accused President Obama of being ""deeply committed to undermining our democracy by undermining the integrity of the elections that are supposed to make us all better off.""

Schiff made the accusations in an opinion piece written with Jim Rutenberg, the Washington Post bureau chief, to explain why he thought Obama's White House would not only try to undermine his committee's investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election, but would also seek to use the committee's investigation to further its own political agenda.

On August 8, The Hill published reports that a top Obama administration official claimed he would consider leaking information about the 2016 presidential election to journalists if the president's re-election chances improved.

In response, House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff said he wanted to hold Obama ""accountable"" for his ""deeply committed to undermining our democracy by undermining the integrity of the elections that are supposed to make us all better off.""

The House committee has been investigating Russian meddling in American elections since last July, when it launched its inquiry into any potential connections between the Trump campaign and a number of Russian entities and officials who worked to sway the vote in favor of the real estate mogul.

On Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey testified to the committee that the FBI has found no evidence to implicate Trump associates or the Trump campaign in hacking attempts against the Democratic National Committee.

In its report, The Hill also quoted a former national intelligence officer who said he believed ""a Russian effort to influence the presidential election was already underway before the FBI's investigation began.""

""It's also worth noting that the DNC hack happened before the committee even had a nominee, and the RNC hack happened before its nominee, which both raise suspicion about collusion before the election was even formally underway,"" The Hill article added.

The Hill article also cited a former CIA official who said the Obama administration's goal was to ""turn this election into a referendum on Trump."""
"New details for the upcoming Xbox One launch day on November 7 have been revealed by Microsoft. In its latest quarterly outlook report, Microsoft noted that pre-orders for the launch console are ""extremely strong."" The company also noted that overall demand for pre-owned Xbox One systems has been ""great,"" both from fans who want to play Xbox 360 games on their current Xbox One system and new customers who may have just bought an Xbox One and want to try out gaming on their new system.

Despite the strong Xbox One launch, Microsoft stated that there is a possibility the system will sell out in time for the holiday season. Additionally, the company noted Xbox One pre-orders were not as strong as it had hoped.

In Microsoft's financial report for the Q3 2015, the company stated, ""Xbox One hardware demand was extremely strong, and we were pleased to see strong demand for Kinect accessory supply. Both hardware and accessory demand were strong enough to offset the lower than anticipated demand for Windows 8 with Windows 8.1 devices when combined."" Microsoft stated that the company wanted to keep all Xbox One buyers happy, and the company has delivered, noting that it ""expects the Xbox One launch to drive continued Xbox Live revenue growth and margin expansion"" in its fiscal year 2016.

Xbox One Launch Day Is Not Completely Automatic

While Microsoft is hoping that a smooth Xbox One launch will help the company to reach sales numbers and improve its financial results, the company did note that the Xbox One launch is not 100 percent automatic. There are, however, certain conditions that must be met before the system can be expected to sell out.

First, Microsoft stated that the Xbox One is launching on the same day as Windows 8.1 as well. There might be a small window for retailers to sell the system. However, Microsoft did add, ""Given the relatively early availability of Windows 8.1, retailers should anticipate a significant increase in demand for this title. In the past, there has been some short lead time between Windows 7/8 launches and launches of their Xbox counterparts.""

Another condition that must be met is that players can log in to Xbox Live from their Xbox One on November 7. Without that, the system couldn't be expected to sell out, Microsoft noted. In addition to that, Microsoft said that consumers can look forward to a better experience playing Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One. Users would have to sign up for the Xbox Live Gold subscription, and the subscription fee could increase the price of the Xbox One once users bought a video game.

In the last couple years, Sony has experienced a similar situation at the start of its new system launch. In many cases, Sony has had to delay the release date of the PlayStation 4 until it was able to secure enough pre-orders for the console to meet demand.

"It's no secret that our country was founded on the Christian faith of America. However, one church is taking this national heritage to a whole new level.

On Sunday, February 2nd, 2016, The Fellowship Church began hosting a ""Day of Prayer for the Pope"". The event, hosted by one of the church's pastors, was a call for worshipers around the country to prayer for Pope Francis.

But there is a twist to the tale. While millions of followers of Christianity in the US were praying for Francis, a few others were praying against him.

The event took place on this very day.

This is the church's full statement on this matter:

""On the feast of the Incarnation, which is this date, the church asks God to protect and deliver all people throughout the world, particularly those in the midst of suffering. We pray these prayers as a call to action, and we appeal to everyone throughout the world to be present at this moment of prayer for the protection of the Church and for the people."" ""As Christians, we believe in and serve all people, we believe in and serve all of humankind, and that's what we believe in during Lent, right? Because if we don't worship the world while we're fasting for Lent, what's the point of fasting? But this time is a special time for us — and that's why it's important for us to make a prayerful and reflective decision to come to Rome to be part of what's happening here… for the people who are suffering and for the people that are in the midst of suffering.""

So what did the day of prayer for the papal visit look like?

On Sunday, people across the country made a special ""pilgrim's journey"" to Rome to pray for our country. Each day, there were masses delivered to the Vatican, masses in honor of Pope Francis and mass for the poor all around Rome.

Some of the masses included:

Mass at St. John Paul II basilica (7 pm)

Mass on Pontifical Hill

Mass at the Church of Sant'Egidio near the Apostolic Palace

The Vatican's National Day of Prayer

Mass in honor of the Holy Family in Santa Teresa, outside of Rome's Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica

What was the message given at some of these masses?

First, it is important to note that at every mass, the pope himself was invited to respond to these prayers. Each one of the masses took on the same theme, saying something along the lines of, ""Pray for us.""

However, as news spread of these masses, the Vatican was quick to get involved in this situation. Pope Francis posted a photo on Twitter of himself praying in front of a large crowd at the mass. He wrote, ""We are here to pray for my beloved country and"

Barry R. Cadden, 54, and his wife, Karen Cadden, 60, were driving home when the dispute erupted. The suspect fired two shots at the car, striking Barry and Karen Cadden, police spokeswoman Monique Bond said.

They are expected to survive in their home state of Texas.

A motive for the shooting remains unknown, but Cadden's relatives had known him several years before the shooting, and they had received threats recently.

"Hamas on Tuesday said it had fired back rockets near Israel and in the Palestinian territories.

A senior Hamas intelligence official said two rockets fell short but several others caused damage in Israel.

In a separate strike, an Israeli tank in the northern Gaza Strip fired on Tuesday at three Palestinian armed groups who were suspected of firing at an outpost at the Israeli side of the border on Monday.

Gaza militants, meanwhile, fired one of their projectiles toward the Israeli city of Ashdod, local authorities said. No injuries were reported.

The two rockets fell short, said the Hamas official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, after Hamas fired several longer-range rockets in the last few years.

""We are sending out warnings to these organizations which target our people,"" said the official. ""We fired a few rounds of shells back at them.""

A Palestinian official said that dozens of Hamas rockets had been fired over the course of Monday.

""There was a great amount of activity,"" said the official. ""People were afraid.""

On Monday, rockets fired by militants in Gaza struck open areas for the first time since 2014, when Israel launched a devastating military campaign against Gaza in which it killed hundreds of militants. The rocket fire appeared to break a temporary agreement to halt the rocket exchange.

The militant group Hamas has largely refrained from rocket fire during the summer, since its 2014 war with Israel and its subsequent pullout. The lull in fighting lasted just over a week, until Hamas resumed the rocket fire last Tuesday, according to Israel Defense Forces and Palestinian officials.

Despite the Hamas pullout last week, the militant group's fire continued, and on Tuesday, two other rockets struck near Ashdod near the Israeli settlement of Ofra. No injuries or damage were reported in the incident.

In the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported that a rocket fired Monday hit a home in the southern city of Rafah, damaging a number of homes for Palestinians in the area. No injuries or damage were reported.

On July 14, Israeli warplanes bombarded Gaza with strikes that leveled at least nine sites and caused extensive damage to the Strip.

On Sunday night, rocket attacks and air strikes continued sporadically throughout the night in the northern part of Gaza, causing damage to Israeli vehicles.

On Sunday morning, the Israeli military said it struck three terror sites in the northern Gaza Strip, including at least one rocket launcher that was operating in the vicinity.

Palestinian factions in Gaza said the strikes targeted a military facility, a rocket launcher and a gathering place used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists. However, the IDF on Monday night said that one of the sites was not operational.

Also over the weekend, Palestinian gunmen attacked Israeli police officers with knives after officers chased"
"This is one example of what a woman might get if she's convicted of having sex with her ex-boyfriend.

A New Jersey woman was arrested after authorities say she engaged in lewd conduct with a police officers' dog.

Elizabeth Palfrey, 32, of Warren Township, was arrested after police in Hackettstown, New Jersey, says officials.

They say Palfrey got into a verbal argument with the officers' dog when she was caught having sex in a back room of a local home.

While she waited to be booked in the Warren jail, she made a call at her home, saying she got married on Aug. 19 and that it wasn't real.

During her call, she allegedly called her ex-boyfriend ""dirty"" and asked him to leave her alone.

Asking a judge to revoke her bail, authorities say Palfrey said she is trying to get his dog out of jail while going to get her husband's dog who was being ""unruly,"" according to WCBS 880's Sophia Hall.

It's not clear if she actually had the dog or if she was trying to get him out of jail.

Palfrey remained in police custody as she awaited a pretrial hearing.

The woman was charged with felony aggravated animal cruelty and misdemeanor sexual misconduct with an animal. She is being held in lieu of $20,000 bail at Warren County Prison."

"The Internet has been eulogized in the media, and in the political arena, for its ability to bring about change. But over the past year, the Internet's ability to bring about change has been more about the same old politics and more about bringing about the same old business model.

Last week, I wrote an article about the Internet's impact on the politics of the Internet business model. The Internet is changing the way that network companies make money, but it's not like the Internet is going to change the politics of the Internet business model.

Well, it is changing the politics of the Internet business model. But it's not going to change the economics.

The business model of Internet companies is based on the idea that they have to charge higher rates for higher bandwidth, and they have to get it from the Internet consumer.

The Internet's business model is based on the idea that the Internet should be an open platform for any kind of content.

We made that clear in the article where we said that the Internet's business model is based on the idea that the Internet should be an open platform for any kind of content.

So, the idea that the Internet could be used to get around the Internet's business model is a ridiculous idea, and the idea that the business model could be changed by the Internet is an equally ridiculous idea.

And then, there's the media. The media are the entertainment industry's closest allies in pushing this idea of making the Internet an open platform. They are the ones doing the talking and raising the money to keep the Internet business model alive, and they're the ones who are most likely to speak with the loudest voice about the idea of the Internet as an open platform.

And so, they are the most likely to advance the idea that changing the business model of the Internet will change the media business model.

The media are the most likely to advance the idea that changing the business model of the Internet will change the media business model.

In fact, they have already done that. They have already done that in the recent struggle over net neutrality. They have already done that in the recent battle over SOPA. They have already done that in the recent fight over the Copyright Office's decision to make it easier for ISPs to get around the BitTorrent protocol.

I thought that the media were attacking the business model, but I was wrong. The media are attacking the idea that the Internet should be an open platform.

The Internet is changing the way that network companies make money, but it's not like the Internet is going to change the politics of the Internet business model.

So, the media are wrong, and the Internet is right.

So, when it comes to the Internet, the media have been wrong. And the Internet is right."

"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that North Korea was developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that could pose a threat as far as New York, despite an effort by China to persuade its neighbour to desist.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump addresses the 73rd session of U.N. General Assembly at the U.N. Headquarters in New York, U.S., September 19, 2017. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo

""They're doing the wrong thing,"" Trump told reporters as he traveled from Warsaw to Germany for a regional summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""It is very difficult to say what they are looking for with respect to an intercontinental missile. Certainly with that kind of technology, it's way past the best capabilities we have.""

Trump's comments are the latest in the escalating tensions over North Korea and its nuclear and missile programs, and came after North Korea claimed it successfully tested an H-bomb on Sunday, a claim that was quickly dismissed by international scientists.

North Korea on Saturday claimed that it conducted a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Hwasong-14, a vehicle that the United States experts say is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.

Asked about comments that North Korea might develop an ICBM that could reach New York, Trump said: ""We're going to do very well in North Korea. We're going to have wonderful relations with them. We're going to do very well with China, we're going to do very well with various nations. No problem""

China, North Korea's closest ally, has urged the United States and its regional allies, South Korea and Japan, to exercise maximum restraint against Pyongyang to prevent the United States from being drawn into a conflict.

The administration of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, repeatedly rejected North Korea's weapons program as ineffectual, and called only for a return to six-nation talks that collapsed following North Korea's third nuclear test in January.

While North Korea has not carried out a nuclear or missile test since the start of last year, it has been inching ahead in developing long-range missile technology and threatening the United States with a nuclear attack.

A senior U.S. defense official played down the threat from North Korea's nuclear weapons program on Saturday, saying there were no indications of an imminent attack on the United States from Pyongyang.

""We view this as a continuation of a pattern of provocative actions by the North Korean regime since 2011,"" the defense official said.

The official said North Korea had yet to prove it had an operational ICBM that could carry a nuclear warhead. The Pentagon has estimated that a North Korean ICBM, if fully functional, could be armed with a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States.

Trump said: ""Hopefully it doesn't happen - but"
"The federal government has reportedly told British Columbia it needs to reduce the number of legal weed orders by 75 per cent by July.

According to a report from The Canadian Press, the federal government has set a target of a 30 per cent reduction in the number of marijuana-related prosecutions by the summer.

The government has also promised to release a ""weed strategy"" by June, which will outline changes to current laws affecting the black market and the medical marijuana industry.

The government has said the strategy will be released in a series of reports, one of which will address the legalization of cannabis for recreational use.

""Our government is committed to developing a comprehensive plan to address the needs of Canadians who use cannabis, while protecting the safety of communities and the public,"" said Health Minister Jane Philpott last week. ""[The strategy] will provide an explanation to the public of how we are working to protect our communities and the health of Canadians.""

The federal government has also indicated it will be looking for ways to reduce health risks related to the drug.

""That includes by ensuring that the right safeguards are in place to protect children and youth,"" said Philpott.

In addition to the reduction of marijuana-related prosecutions, the federal government has also indicated it will be implementing broader cannabis legislation to make selling marijuana to minors more difficult, as well as to increase the quantity of cannabis allowed for personal use.

This week, the B.C. government also announced a government-funded study of the health effects of marijuana. The study will be conducted by the University of Victoria's Centre for Addictions Research of B.C.

"There's a saying ""the best thing to watch on a Monday is a baseball game on the tube,"" and this past weekend, the Pittsburgh native who popularized that saying, and was the person who took in nearly every major professional game at the time, was a baseball player. For the second straight year, we witnessed a game in Pittsburgh that was full of baseball.

The game was a 3-2 Phillies win over the New York Yankees, who had a night to remember for a variety of reasons. It included three homers, as well as a few other things that could make it the worst game of the season, such as the Yankees being at the bottom of the lineup and starting two rookies (Adam Warren and Rob Refsnyder), both of whom could have done with some extra playing time, that was not given to them. But it was more than just a game in which the Yankees were terrible.

What the Yankees did to the Philadelphia A's is as bad as it gets, and it was all by design.

Last year, the Phillies were still on their way to the division title, and were even in the postseason. A two-year playoff drought is enough to make most people nervous, but the 2012 Philadelphia Phillies were different. In the 2013 season, the Phillies were on a two-year tear as well, entering the game 0.5 games behind the Baltimore Orioles and 4.5 games behind the Chicago Cubs at the start of April. In an odd twist, both teams failed to make the postseason despite being an.858 save and 2.75 ERA, respectively, over the two-year span. Then, at the end of the season, they were swept by the Yankees. With the teams separated in the standings and the AL Wild Card spot that would go to the winner, the Phillies and the Yankees were still very much in the thick of it, and both teams were vying for the top spot in their respective divisions.

Fast-forward to the start of the 2013 season. The Phillies had a few changes of personnel, but the one that really caught the Phillies' GM and manager completely by surprise was the promotion of Roy Halladay to the rotation, a move that should have been a non-issue as long as they didn't have to play second base. For the Yankees though, the move made perfect sense. For starters, it gave David Robertson a legit place start that he would normally have to earn, which he was doing in his role. Secondly, the move opened up the bullpen in front of Derek Jeter, which in turn allowed Jeter to pinch hit in games and pitch more during regular season play. And, last but not least, it allowed Jeter to make his fourth-consecutive Opening Day roster, which he did not do at the onset of this season.

But all of these reasons could be used to explain the whole thing, but in the minds of the Yankees on the"
"A new study by the National Bureau of Economic Research finds that the number of Americans who have no health insurance rose for the first time in four years in the first three months of 2015.

The report finds that the uninsured rate — the share of adults who are without insurance — rose from 15.9 percent in January 2014 to 16.4 percent in December 2014. This is the first time in four years that the rate has risen.

The increases largely reflect changes in the economy, the study found. The number of people without health insurance was higher in the first quarter of 2014, but in the second quarter, the number was lower.

The share of uninsured adults rose almost 2 percentage points, from 13.6 percent to 14.4 percent.

""The increases reflect people who had health insurance before the onset of the economic recession, and who lost it because they lost a job, because their health insurance expired, or because they were no longer eligible for coverage,"" lead author Robert Blendon said in a statement. ""Some of the increase may reflect people who lost their jobs shortly after the recession ended.""

The report also found that the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults fell slightly from 15.4 percent in December 2014 to 15.1 percent in January 2015.

The report comes as President Obama has been pushing Congress to resubmit his health care law, which he has said is unsustainable without a large federal investment in a robust health insurance market.

The study found that the uninsured rate rose in all states except North Dakota, Alaska, and Wyoming. It was highest in the District of Columbia, where the rate was 21.2 percent."
"The world's oldest woman, 102, has died at the age of 102 after spending the last two centuries in her own world, the MailOnline reported.

The mysterious woman was born in a small village near the Syrian town of Jableh in 1915 to a family of farmers. The youngest of five, Nadiya was brought up in a very strict and humble household.

It was only in the 1930s that the family began to migrate to Baghdad and then other places in the Middle East, according to the website.

The secret to her longevity has been revealed in the book The Mysterious Death of Mrs Mahfoud Mahfuz: Secrets of Her Longevity, which was published in March.

According to the author Michael Berenbaum, one reason Mrs Mahfoud Mahfuz enjoyed such longevity was because she ate a diet of mainly boiled sweets and boiled water during her pre-menstrual phases.

Ms Berenbaum told a newspaper: ""Many people said she was a miracle patient, but she didn't need that kind of treatment and we didn't have time to do a lot of research to make sure.

""The other amazing thing about her longevity is that she never exercised.""

As a teenager, she would take a boat ride across the Euphrates to her uncle's shop where she would spend her summers playing ball.

"The right-wing press has been running a smear campaign against President Obama. The media has fed lurid stories about his alleged ""birth certificate."" But the most egregious allegation is that he is not a citizen.

That is an outrage and must be vigorously addressed.

The recent House vote to impeach President Clinton was an important moment in the history of the Republican Party.

The Republican Party was the party of Lincoln. It was the party that began the Civil War. It was the party of ending slavery. It was the party that fought for women's rights. It was the party that helped to save the United States from bankruptcy and defeat communism.

Since then, the Republican Party has moved in the direction of the Republican Party of today. It is the party of economic nationalism, anti-government rhetoric, anti-immigration rhetoric, and hostility toward those who do not look, talk, or believe like the Republican Party's voters.

The Republican Party has become the party of hate.

The right-wing media has been running a smear campaign against President Obama. The media has fed lurid stories about his alleged ""birth certificate."" But the most egregious allegation is that he is not a citizen.

When the Republican Party is the party of Lincoln and the right-wing media is a party of hate, it is not surprising that the Republican Party is reviving the racist theories that fueled the American Civil War.

It is also not surprising that some Republicans want to stop the rise of the Democratic Party. It is no secret that the Republican Party's ""leaders"" are racist and anti-gay. Their actions speak louder than the words.

In this election, the right-wing media has ramped up its attack on President Obama. The most egregious smear of all came from the ""liberal"" National Review. In a cover story, they claimed that President Obama is not a ""natural-born citizen.""

The National Review is a leading voice of the Republican Party and is a favorite of the right-wing media. The National Review is a leading voice of the Republican Party and is a favorite of the right-wing media.

"This is part two of the blog series, ""Wizards On Deck In D&D Next."" If you missed part one, read ""Wizards On Deck In D&D Next,"" part one, here.

Wizards Of The Coast are working on new D&D products, which will begin sometime this year. As part of their process to get the game in your hands, they have made public some preliminary details about what they're working on.

Their first effort will be a new module for D&D Next, known technically as ""Dungeons Of Dragons Next,"" but in real-life, it's a Dungeon Master's Screen. The screen, which will have both a screen and an SD card slot, will have a built-in map of the D&D world as well as some of the other core features to help players run their own sessions.

The idea is that, with the screen's map, the players would only have to look at it once to have a full understanding of their surroundings in the adventure world they're about to enter. Because the resolution is on a much finer scale than the normal paper, that means the map can be used to display details like tree rings and water flow.

The concept is still being worked out, so while it's a good option for those who don't think that paper maps are cool, it also might not be as good as I'd like for role-players who like their maps to be detailed.

According to the company, Dungeons of Dragons Next can be either in color or monochrome. The screen is going to have some sort of cover, just like D&D Next is meant to be used. This means, again, that you'll be able to display more visual detail than with the current D&D game, such as displaying the map of the city you're trying to find, or just the main city.

Wizards also has plans to publish a second module for D&D Next, one that is specifically designed for a D&D Next game. They're still in the design and development phases, but they've said that one will be a mini-campaign for the game. As the title suggests, we'll probably be hearing more about this one at Gen Con next year.

In case you want a preview, below you can see a sample screen from one of the D&D Next modules (which have yet to be released).

"The story of the famous Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who was assassinated by a Jew in 1991, is one of the most amazing in the history of the world and has been covered by the most different media outlets in the world. The story of how Wiesenthal committed his own murder is one of the most shocking, and just as unbelievable, as it was that the Jew who killed Wiesenthal actually committed the crime himself.

Simon Wiesenthal was born in Budapest, Hungary on August 12th, 1922. He was the son of a wealthy Jewish family, so he was not a big man, but he was a real talent and he could carve a career in the art world, thanks to his artistic talent. Wiesenthal's father had a book store in Budapest, and so Wiesenthal's family became well-known in Hungary.

Around 1952, Wiesenthal joined the Hungarian police force and he became a police captain in 1962. The Nazis were on the rise in Hungary, and so Wiesenthal decided to join the police force to protect Hungary's Jews from the Nazi invasion.

In November of 1964, Wiesenthal was stationed as a police captain in Szeged, Hungary. Szeged was the capital of Hungary, and the Nazis had decided to attack the city. The Nazis had a lot of support in the local Jewish community, so Wiesenthal was the only one who could take care of the Jewish community.

On November 2nd, Wiesenthal was sitting in his car when he was ambushed by a group of Hungarian Nazis who wanted to kill him. Wiesenthal took out his pistol and shot the two Nazi gunmen. After the Nazis were killed, the two other Nazi shooters came out of the woods and shot Wiesenthal three times in the head. Wiesenthal died on the spot. The two Nazis who shot him were executed as well.

"New research sheds light on an evolutionary mystery: why some children tend to be much less interested in people than others, a phenomenon that leads to an early onset of autism.

People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often unable to interact with others in social interactions. They are often described as having a lack of eye contact or an inability to make eye contact.

""I think we now have a very good idea why some children are less interested in people,"" said lead author Dr. Richard Ryan of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""It turns out we learn through socialization about how to interact with other people.""

The study, published online Feb. 20 in the journal Current Biology, examined gene expression, a pattern of gene activity, in the brains of children and adults with autism spectrum disorder.

The genes and the activity of those genes were shown to be different in different brains, leading the study authors to theorize that children with autism spectrum disorder may have an early childhood that's more abnormal in social interaction. And that may cause their brains to be more abnormal as they grow older.

""This is not a diagnosis that we give, but it's how people are diagnosed,"" said research co-author Dr. Brian Hare, director of the Duke Autism Center.

""This shows us what's happening early in life in the brain and in certain brain circuits that makes people less able to communicate and interact socially,"" Hare said.

The brain's circuits for social interaction evolved about 3 million years ago, when ancestors of mammals, primates, and humans began to form small social groups, said Ryan, a postdoctoral fellow in Hare's group at Duke University.

""That socialization of people was important for us to learn how to live in large groups in nature,"" Ryan said. ""It could be that our early social interactions were the reason for our early brain anomalies -- we just had to learn to live around other people because that's how we lived before we had modern brains.""

The gene expression patterns found in children with autism spectrum disorder were linked to an earlier onset of autism.

""It looks like the early brain circuits that play a significant role in social behavior are disrupted in children with autism,"" Hare said.

One of the genes involved in social brain circuits for autism also happens to be a risk factor of schizophrenia, Hare said. Previous research by Hare and his colleagues suggested that children with autism spectrum disorder have a slower onset of schizophrenia as compared to other children.

The researchers compared gene expression in the brains of children with autism spectrum disorder with brain tissue from healthy children. They focused on a section of the brain called the temporal cortex, which is involved in social cognition and social behavior, Ryan said.

During a neuroimaging session, researchers scanned the brains of the children with ASD and control groups who did not have autism. Researchers were looking at brain regions involved in social behavior,"
"As part of the ongoing effort to improve and expand one of the most unique and diverse clubs in the world, the WPS has announced the signings of four new players.

The quartet of players will take the number of international players on the roster to 16, and are being added to the roster in order of their most recent national team call-ups. The most recent call-ups are: Amber Brooks, Courtney Jones, Nicole Barnhart and Megan Rapinoe.

""We are excited to welcome these players to the WPS,"" said WPS President Lisa Graham. ""All four are world-class players and we are confident that they will help us to continue our growth.""

Brooks, known as the ""Iron Lady of Soccer,"" made her international debut for the U.S. Women's National Team in March and went on to make five appearances for that team, the first of which came in the WUSA, where she scored two goals in the inaugural match. Brooks was named the U.S. Soccer Player of the Year in 2015 for her work with the U.S. Soccer Women's National Team and will be looking to further develop her game at the highest level with the Boston Breakers from 2017.

""I'm absolutely thrilled to join the Boston Breakers,"" said Brooks. ""I'm looking forward to continuing to build my game and continue to learn from the coaching staff. I know that the players on the team are very talented and I look forward to getting some playing time in the Breakers.""

In 2016, Jones made her first World Cup Qualifying appearance after just a few months on the WNT roster. She made her debut in the U.S. Women's National Team's final match of the 2015 FIFA World Cup in Brazil where she scored the game-winning goal in the semifinal against Japan. Since then, Jones has been on a tear, notching a pair of goals and two assists in 2016. Jones, who has made 103 career appearances for the U.S. Women's National Team, will look to continue her progress and make a case for a spot on the national team's roster in 2017.

Barnhart, a native of Memphis, Tenn., has been capped four times by the United States National Team and has been called into the rosters of the U.S. Women's National Team for both the 2013 and 2014 FIFA Women's World Cups, scoring a goal in the 2013 World Cup and earning a call-up to the 2014 World Cup. Barnhart will look to continue her development and be the starting midfielder in the Breakers.

Rapinoe, the first American to be named to the World Cup All-Star team in 2014, has been capped four times by the United States National Team and is the all-time leading scorer for the U.S. Women's National Team. Rapinoe will look to continue her development and be a key contributor for"

"You may have noticed a new logo on American Apparel shirts – for the first time since it was acquired by Lululemon in 2013, it has a different logo.

A spokesman for the brand confirmed to the Globe and Mail that the Canadian company had decided to change its logo because its new owner, Quebecor Media, has a different attitude towards the brand than previous owners, and ""values its Canadian identity.""

This logo change seems a little odd, because it's hard to believe that anything else would have been a better choice for a company that was built on the premise that it would always be ""the first company to market on every idea."" In fact, until this point, the new logo would probably have been the most consistent part of American Apparel's advertising.


Lululemon's initial foray into the apparel market was marked by a series of very distinctive, very short-sleeved ""T-shirts"" that look like a long-sleeved version of the classic Levi's 501 jeans. The most famous of these was the ""tiger mom"" T-shirt, worn by the CEO of Lululemon, Chip Wilson. They would later merge with Levi's in 2012 and are now part of Lululemon Athletica, a division of the company that makes a range of athletic apparel.

What's most exciting about this new logo is that if you weren't paying attention, you'd be forgiven for mistaking it for either Lululemon's or the Vancouver hockey team's logo, both of which are pretty obvious and inoffensive – if not a little bland. As with the Canadian version, these logos are likely going to get some use as the company changes."

"1:15p.m., April 9, 2013--It was a busy Thursday in Baltimore with six different mass killings taking place in under two hours.

The first shooting took place around 12:10am, when two people were killed and three people were injured inside of a home. Police believe the incident began when the suspect entered the residence and began shooting.

A short time later, on the 1300 block of N. Harwood St., at 12:20a., 28-year-old Joseph Mitchell was shot outside of the home. Two children, ages 6 and 9, witnessed the shooting. The children said they heard multiple gunshots followed by the sound of a car rolling off.

Officers responded to the scene and found the vehicle outside the home, where they also found a man in a ""significant"" state of condition. Police believe he suffered a gunshot wound to the head.

Police confirmed on Thursday morning that they believed this was the shooter, but did not release his identity.

The other three tragedies followed at various points:

At 10:10p., a man was found fatally shot at a home in the 2100 block of Ritchie Rd. Police believe that he was a known gang member and there may have been a dispute between the two parties. Police arrested 27-year-old Michael Williams, and found him at the location.

At 11:10p., at the 100 block of West Madison St., a 35-year-old man was shot after a drive-by shooting. A bystander was struck and was taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

At 12:30a., at the 1500 block of S. Park Rd., 34-year-old Johnathon Wright was shot and killed. The victim's girlfriend reported the incident to police, and police later found the suspect matching the description of the shooter sitting behind Mr. Wright's car. Officers also found Mr. Wright's wife, 21-year-old Jessica Wright, at the scene. The victims were married.

Just before 1 p.m., a man was killed inside of a home in the 5500 block of N. Greenmount Ave. Police believe this was an drive-by shooting. Officers found the deceased at the residence.

Just before 1:30 p.m., on the 1200 block of N. Calvert St., a 28-year-old woman was fatally shot. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.

The third homicide happened shortly before 2 p.m. in the 500 block of N. Charles St. Police believe that the shooting, which is believed to be domestic related, may be related to a disagreement at school. Detectives said that they believe the shooter and victim knew each other prior to this incident.

"A new study by University of California, San Francisco, researchers finds that large-scale changes in the Earth's climate over the past century have been driven by the powerful greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide released by human activities.

""We found that the rate of global warming has increased dramatically over the past century, the rate of cooling has decreased, and the cooling is predominately due to carbon dioxide emissions,"" said study author Jay Zwally, a professor of earth system science at UC San Francisco.

The research is published in the journal Science.

The study used a variety of data sets to assemble a record of global temperature changes from 1880 to the present. The resulting record shows that the Earth's climate has warmed by an average of 0.17 degrees Celsius (0.30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past century, a rate that Zwally says is unprecedented in the last 800,000 years.

The study is the first to quantify the role of carbon dioxide in climate change and to assess the strength of the greenhouse effect. The study also found that the Earth's climate is sensitive to the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. At high levels, the world's climate is ""unstable,"" Zwally said.

""We found that the rate of global warming has increased dramatically over the past century, the rate of cooling has decreased, and the cooling is predominately due to carbon dioxide emissions,"" Zwally said. ""A warmer climate is a more stable climate.""

Zwally's co-author, Jack Richardson from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said the findings show that human activities are driving global climate change, an effect that is likely to continue for many centuries.

""Our research shows that human-caused climate change is very likely causing significant changes in the Earth's climate,"" Richardson said.

The scientists' findings are particularly important in view of the growing desire among politicians to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Almost a third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from human activities, including transportation, electricity generation and industry.

""We are in a period of rapid climate change, and that is a very dangerous thing, because we are changing the climate system so rapidly,"" Zwally said.

The study found that the warming trend is driven by human activities: fossil fuel burning, land use change and deforestation, as well as methane emissions from terrestrial ecosystems.

Another important finding is that the Earth's climate has warmed at a faster rate in the past century than in the previous 11,300 years. This phenomenon is called the 'hockey stick' graph.

""Global warming is occurring globally,"" Zwally said. ""It is happening in the northern hemisphere and it is occurring in the southern hemisphere. It is occurring in the ocean and it is occurring in the land.""

Zwally said the study also found that the average temperature of the polar regions is rising more"

"For years, many have wondered why the Henkel company has been so slow to produce a water filtration system. Henkel's Swiss Water filtration system started hitting shelves in 2013, but the company has only recently started selling it to the public.

The Henkel system is a reverse osmosis system that uses concentrated salt water to filter out impurities from tap water. The system's main benefit is the water's clarity and reduced taste and odor.

Henkel's first foray into water filtration was announced in 2011, with the company touting the new system as being ""100 percent safe and 100 percent effective."" The company's 2014 marketing materials insisted the system's ""natural filtration of bacteria and harmful microorganisms"" would be ""100 percent effective."" But the American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) later determined that, while the system ""reduces the amount of bacteria in water,"" it did not ""have a detectable impact on the taste and odor of the water.""

A 2014 study by the EPA's Office of Water found that the Henkel system might not even be able to remove all of the small particles in water.

In addition, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that the Henkel system does not remove many of the contaminants that are found in tap water, including sediment, metals and pesticides.

The EPA has also found that the Henkel system is not as effective as a similar system used by the U.K. government.

The EPA's negative findings haven't stopped Henkel, though. In an attempt to boost sales, the company has been actively marketing its system abroad to foreign governments, and even to the U.S. This year, Henkel will begin selling its system in Malaysia, where it will be sold for $2,000.

"The Pentagon is using a $3.5 billion program to upgrade the U.S. Army's XM1952 Falcon anti-tank missile through 2019 to detect, track and destroy electronic warfare systems.

The program was given a major boost last month when Army Secretary John McHugh visited the White House to meet with President Donald Trump.

The Pentagon has been using the XM1952 program since 2001 to upgrade the Navy's land-based version of the missile. The Army rebuilt the missile's guidance system, reduced radio frequency interference and enhanced its performance.

The program has a goal of upgrading the XM1952's performance to the point where it will be able to destroy its target without the need for a crew member to be on the ground. The Army's XM1952 is currently capable of hitting targets more than 100 miles away.

The XM1952 is known as an ""active electronically scanned array"" (AESA) radar that is designed to detect and track enemy electronics. The missile's guidance system is able to detect and track a wide range of enemy electronic warfare systems, including jamming, spoofing, encryption and radio frequency interference.

The Army's last major upgrade to the XM1952 was in 2014, when the Army added additional software to improve the missile's performance in combat.

The XM1952's radio frequency interference has been a problem for the Army since the beginning of the program. The missile was originally designed to track enemy electronic warfare systems by using a radar to detect and track the enemy's radar.

The Army is still conducting tests to determine the optimal configuration of the radar to remove the radio frequency interference. The tests are expected to be completed by the end of 2017, according to the Army.

The Army's upgrade includes a new navigation and tracking system that is able to track the enemy's missile faster and with greater accuracy than the old navigation system. The new system is also able to track the enemy's radar at longer ranges than the previous navigation system.

The Army is also replacing its air-to-ground guidance system with a new one that can track enemy electronic warfare systems from more than 100 miles away. The new guidance system is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.

The upgrade to the XM1952 was originally scheduled to be completed in 2014. The Army had to push the completion date back because of problems like the radio frequency interference.

The XM1952 missile was introduced in the 1980s."
"In a rare interview with the Huffington Post, former President Bill Clinton says he feels ""so bad"" for his friend and now possible GOP rival Donald Trump.

The former president, who hasn't endorsed anyone for president, says he empathizes with Trump's loss to Hillary Clinton.

""I had been the president at a lot of those times in the 1990s,"" Bill Clinton said. ""And I felt, 'I mean, why? It doesn't seem to matter to me, but I have to tell you, I do feel so bad for this guy.' We've worked with him, we've liked him. He was a nice guy. We went places together.""

Bill Clinton did acknowledge that he and Trump could be polar opposites.

""I would say that, to be very honest, I think he's sort of half of me when it comes to how he approaches things,"" he said.

He was also very critical of former President George W. Bush saying the former two-term president was ""not ready"" or ""not ready"" in 2003 for what followed after the Iraq War.

""I don't think he really grasped the political consequences of what he did,"" Bill Clinton said. ""And now he's going to ask people to trust him and to put trust in him again.""

According to the Huffington Post, the former president says that while Trump is a racist, he isn't that far off from being a racist.

""He is racist, but he is not as bad as some other people who are racists and who are demagogues,"" he said.

At least one prominent Democrat agreed with Bill that Trump's candidacy is ""demagoguery.""

""When he says 'I alone,' he's not alone,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). ""He's putting white supremacists everywhere. When Trump says 'I alone' -- what? He's saying 'I'll make America great again by making all of your communities great again. Don't worry about your friends down south.'""
