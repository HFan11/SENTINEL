"Palms sweaty, heart racing, stomach in knots. You can't cry for help. Not only is your throat too tight to breathe, but it'd be so embarrassing. No, you aren't being stalked by a monster, you're speaking in public, a fate some deem worse than death.see, when you're dead, you feel nothing; at a podium, you feel stage fright. But at some point we've all had to communicate in front of people, so you have to try and overcome it.to start, understand what stage fright is. Humans, social animals that we are, are wired to worry about reputation. Public speaking can threaten it. Before a speech, you fret, ""what if people think i'm awful and i'm an idiot?"""
"I can't think of anyone who just has one interest in life, and that's all they want to do for the rest of their life. [the way we work]around 15 percent of american workers don't have traditional full-time jobs. They're half-time, part-time, contract workers or temps. The term ""side hustle"" just seems to fit with this ethos where people are putting together a few different things to make a living.the word ""side hustle"" has its roots in popular african american newspapers. In the 1920s, these papers used the word ""hustle"" to refer to some kind of scam. By the 1950s, they were using ""side hustle"" to refer to legitimate work, too. A side hustle is a little different than a second job. A second job is about necessity."
"Pharmacists who are not involved in a hospital or long term care environment who lack an in-depth knowledge of the medication process will benefit from additional education and training. This will enable them to provide better patient care and management in a hospital or long term care environment. Following pharmacy school, many pharmacists practice in hospitals or long term care environments. These pharmacists often gain more education and training through a pharmacy practice residency and/or one or more additional residencies in a specific discipline of pharmacy. The additional residencies provide the pharmacists with a specialized knowledge of that discipline. After additional training, these pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists. Within the disciplines of pharmacy, there are specific specialties that require additional training to practice effectively."
"'During the same year, Tesla wrote a treatise, The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, concerning charged particle beam weapons. Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a ""superweapon that would put an end to all war."" This treatise is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.' The passage can be found in the book 'Nikola Tesla."
"In the passage, ""There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice."" and the question is ""Going to jail accomplished what goal of civil disobedience?"" The answer is ""The goal of civil disobedience is to challenge the rule of law and bring attention to injustice. When protesters choose to go to jail as a way of continuing their protest, they are challenging the rule of law and challenging the legitimacy of the government. By refusing to comply with the law, they are demonstrating their commitment to the cause of justice"
"In the United States, the Constitution includes several amendments known as the Bill of Rights. These amendments are a set of protections that apply to all citizens of the United States, including the right to free speech, the right to a fair trial, and the right to a remedy in the form of a jury trial. Some of the amendments include the Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from providing public funding for the construction of Establishment Clause educational institutions. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Establishment Clause does not prohibit the government from providing public funding for private schools, as long as the schools are not operated by the state."
"The passage discusses the formation of topographic gradients during deformation, which is the process by which the sediment that is deposited on the rock units that are rising or falling in elevation is eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are then deposited on the rock units that are going down, which creates the difference in elevation between the rock units. The passage also notes that deformational events, such as faulting and volcanic activity, result in the creation of accommodation space for sediment to deposit. These events are often associated with volcanism and igneous activity, which can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, long,"
"'due to pressure from film studios wanting to increase their production, as the major networks began airing theatrically released films, abc joined cbs and nbc in broadcasting films on sunday nights in 1962, with the launch of the abc sunday night movie, which debuted a year behind its competitors and was initially presented in black-and-white. Despite a significant increase in viewership (with its audience share having increased to 33% from the 15% share it had in 1953), abc remained in third place; the company had a total revenue of $15.5 million, a third of the revenue pulled in by cbs at the same period.

"In 2012, the economist intelligence unit ranked warsaw as the 32nd most liveable city in the world. It was also ranked as one of the most liveable cities in central europe. Today, warsaw is considered an ""alpha–"" global city, a major international tourist destination and a significant cultural, political and economic hub. The city is a significant center of research and development, bpo, ito, as well as of the polish media industry. The warsaw stock exchange is one of the largest and most important in central and eastern europe. Frontex, the european union agency for external border security, has its headquarters in warsaw"
"In 1523, luther wrote that jesus christ was born a jew which discouraged mistreatment of the jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the old testament could be shown to speak of jesus christ. However, as the reformation continued, luther began to lose hope in large-scale jewish conversion to christianity. In his later years, luther grew more hostile toward the jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the anabaptists, zwinglianism, and the papacy. His 1543 treatise von den juden und ihren lügen (on the jews and their lies"
"It depends on the situation, but generally speaking, a sword is more likely to be used in a fight than a pen. Swords are more versatile and can be used for a variety of tasks besides fighting, such as chopping wood, cutting rope, and even as a tool for self-defense. In contrast, a pen is a very useful tool for writing and can be used for a variety of tasks besides writing, such as marking notes, writing messages, and even as a tool for drawing and sculpting. So, in general, a sword would be more useful in a physical fight than a pen."
The purpose of the aser is to evaluate the academic performance of schools in rural india and to assess the effectiveness of the education system in the country. The aser is an annual report that evaluates the status of education in rural india and provides recommendations for improvement. The report is compiled by the national education commission (nec) and is based on data collected by the national education monitoring bureau (nemb). The report is used by the government to monitor the progress of schools and to identify areas for improvement. The report also serves as a basis for the government to evaluate the overall performance of schools and to make decisions about funding and policy.
"The passage provides information about the concerns raised about the quality of levi's stadium's field, including that it needed to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and that during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under baltimore ravens kicker justin tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal. The nfl has since re-sodded the field with a new playing surface, which is a hybrid bermuda 419 turf. However, the turf showed problem throughout the game, with several players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all"
"Under a stable market economy, where employer cannot pass the costs of employing workers on to the consumer, the competitive market will lead to wages being set equal to the cost of the worker's labor. As a result of this competitive market, the most efficient employers will be able to employ the lowest cost labor while still being able to afford to offer a fair wage to employees. As the most competitive employers offer the lowest cost, they will be rewarded with the best labor pool for their reduced cost of employing this lowest cost labor. The result is that, overall, a stable market economy will lead to workers being paid fairly."
"There are multiple reasons for the movement to legalize importing medicines from other countries. One of the main reasons is that it is highly likely that such a move would save american consumers millions of dollars as the fda regulations make it illegal for consumers to import canadian drugs for personal use. However, the move has been met with considerable push back from a minority of american citizens who argue that importation of medications for personal use is constitutionally protected as a 'privacy right'. It is important to note that there is no known case of any u.s. Citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities."
"There are several alternative health practices that have been shown to have a positive impact on health through scientific research. Some of the most well-studied practices include: 1. Meditation and mindfulness: Studies have shown that these practices can reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and enhance overall well-being. 2. Acupuncture: This traditional Chinese practice has been shown to be effective for managing pain, reducing inflammation, and improving sleep quality. 3. Tai chi: This gentle form of exercise has been shown to improve balance, flexibility, and overall physical function, as well as reducing stress and anxiety. 4. Yoga: This practice has been shown to improve flexibility, balance, and strength, as well as reducing stress, anxiety, and depression."
"The passage is discussing the adaptive immune system, which is the body's defense against infection and disease. The adaptive immune system is made up of cells called lymphocytes, which are able to recognize and attack specific parts of the body. These cells include b cells, t cells, and natural killer (nk) cells. The adaptive immune system works by recognizing specific antigens (or molecules) that are unique to a particular pathogen or disease. When a pathogen or disease enters the body, the immune system produces antibodies that can recognize and neutralize the pathogen. These antibodies can then help the body's other immune system cells recognize and attack the pathogen."
"Ctenophores are animals that live in oceans and seas, and are known for being ""dead ends"" in marine food chains because they have a low ratio of organic matter to salt and water. They are also sometimes difficult to identify in the guts of potential predators due to their ability to survive for long periods without being eaten. Beroids, which are herbivorous fish that mainly eat ctenophores, have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is because they have a greater effect on the populations of other ctenophores, such as jellyfish and turtles, which in turn have a greater effect on"
"According to the passage, the decline of organized labor in the us has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization. Rosenfield points out that nations with high rates of unionization, particularly in scandinavia, have very low levels of inequality, and concludes ""the historical pattern is clear; the cross-national pattern is clear: high inequality goes hand-in-hand with weak labor movements and vice-versa."" he also asserts that the decline of organized labor in the us has had a negative impact on the labor markets in the us."
"The passage discusses the classical view of economics that views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital, and land. This perspective sees wages and profits determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor, which in turn is determined by differences in the productivity of different classes of workers. This view sees inequality as reflecting the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions. The passage also notes that within labor income distribution is due to differences in the value added of different classifications of workers, and that in a market economy, wages and profits are determined by the productivity of different economic actors."
"If a fund has made big returns every year for ten years, it's a good sign that the fund has performed well in the past. However, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and there are many factors that can impact a fund's returns. It's important to consider the fund's investment strategy, management team, and risk profile before making an investment decision. Additionally, it's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to help determine if the fund is a good fit for your investment goals and risk tolerance."
"The passage mentions that the museum's collections of south and southeast asian art are the most comprehensive in western countries, with nearly 60,000 objects including 10,000 textiles and 6000 paintings. The jawaharlal nehru gallery of indian art contains a range from about 500 bc to the 19th century, with an extensive collection of sculpture mainly religious in nature, hindu buddhist and jaiin. India was a large producer of textiles, including dyed cotton and muslin. The museum's collections also include carpets from agra and lahore, as well as examples of clothing such as sequins and beads. The"
"It was not until january 1518 that friends of luther translated the theses from latin into german and printed and widely copied them, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press. Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout germany; within two months, they had spread throughout europe. The first printing of the theses was done by johannes gutenberg in germany in 1523, and the first printed copies were made in 1524 by beda and benet."
"It is difficult to provide a precise answer to this question, as the affordability of food in Canada has likely changed significantly since 1970 due to a variety of factors such as inflation, changes in government policies, and shifts in consumer demand and spending. However, I can provide some general information on the trends that have been observed in the affordability of food in Canada over the past few decades. In the 1970s, the cost of living in Canada was relatively low, and the government implemented policies to reduce the income gap between the rich and the poor. These policies included implementing a minimum wage, increasing the cost of housing, and implementing programs to help low-income families improve their financial situation."
"The question doesn't make sense. The passage doesn't mention the number of points the broncos scored in the final three minutes of the game. However, the answer is as follows: 11 points. The paragraph mentions that the broncos defeated the pittsburgh steelers in the divisional round. This means that they had to play against the steelers again in the afc championship game. By the time the game ended, the steelers had already lost. In that case, the passage refers to the number of points the steelers lost against the broncos, 23 - 16 = 7. And then, in the final three minutes of the game, the steelers had to add 11 - 7 = 4 points, which they also managed to do."
"In the passage you provided, it is mentioned that if a and q are coprime, then the number of primes in the progression is infinite. The greatest common divisor of a and q is one. Let me use this fact to conclude that if q and a are coprime, then there must be infinitely many primes in the progression. Let the numbers in the progression be pn where n is a positive integer. If there were a lower bound for n, then the set {pn | n < k} would be bounded. But this implies there exists an upper bound for the set of integers {pn | n < k}. This is a contradiction, so there must be infinitely many primes in the progression."
"Doctor who and star trek share many similarities, most notably that they are science-fiction shows that use time travel. They each have had numerous storylines and continuations. The most notable of these are the 2005 version of doctor who, which is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963–1989 series, and the 1996 telefilm. Doctor who differs from most other series relaunches, which are either reboots or set in the same universe but in a different time period and with different characters. Examples of the former are battlestar galactica and bionic woman. The former star trek series, the next generation and spin-offs, are examples of the latter."
"The answer is orange. The sun is usually described as being orange because its surface appears to be a reddish-orange due to the scattering of its light as it passes through gases in Earth's atmosphere. The scattering of the light allows scientists to see the surface of the sun even though it is many solar radii (a solar radius is the length of a circle with the sun at its center) away. When viewed from Earth, the surface of the sun appears orange due to the light it emits at a particular wavelength (visible light has a range of colors that depend on the wavelengths of light that are reflected). Earth's atmosphere causes the light from the sun to be scattered in a variety of colors as it passes through it."
"A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths"
"Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of o2 at lower temperatures (see physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o2 in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of o2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration."
"Distributed adaptive message block switching (dams) was a concept developed by paul baran in the late 1950s to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunications messages as part of a research program at the rand corporation, funded by the us department of defense. It contrasted and contradicted established principles for pre-allocating network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in bell system. The concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of donald davies at npal in the late 1960s. He is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching"
"There are several factors that contributed to the surge of creativity and originality among artists in the 1960s: 1. Counter-culture and social revolution: The 1960s was a time of significant social, cultural, and political upheaval. The counterculture movement, civil rights, and anti-war protests challenged the status quo and traditional norms. This created a climate of rebellion, experimentation, and creativity that inspired artists to take risks and explore new ideas. 2. Technological advancements: The 1960s was a time of great technological progress, especially in the fields of television, film, and music. This allowed artists to experiment with new techniques and styles that were previously not possible."
"Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. This means that workers can choose to work for wages that are determined by the market, and that employers can choose to pay wages that are above or below market wages to attract workers. In a capitalist mode of production, the workers are controlled by the market and wages are determined by the price of skill, which is determined by the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. Therefore, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. However, in"
"It became a moral justification to lift the world up to french standards by bringing christianity and french culture. In 1884, the leading exponent of colonialism, jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission: ""the higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior"". Full citizenship rights – '’assimilation’’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. Contrasting from britain, france sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of algeria, where french settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority."
"3. Globalization: Advances in transportation and communication made the world a smaller place. Artists were exposed to a wider range of cultures, music, art, and literature, which inspired them to blend different styles and create something new and unique. 4. Freedom of expression: The 1960s was a time when the censorship and repression of artistic expression began to relax. This gave artists the freedom to explore taboo topics and experiment with controversial themes without fear of retribution. Overall, the creative explosion of the 1960s was a result of the perfect storm of social, technological, and cultural factors that allowed artists to break free from traditional molds and create something entirely new."
"The passage states that the presiding officer decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak. The presiding officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The presiding officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping"
"Reading books in the dark is an excellent way to learn about the world around us and gain knowledge and skills. If you are reading in the dark you are in a safe environment and the words you are reading are not coming from your own personal experience or opinions. This means that you are getting the information from a source other than your own thoughts and opinions, which can be a very helpful way to learn and grow. If you are reading in the dark you are also learning from the perspective of others, and this can be a very valuable way to understand the world around you."
"Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners, creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock. By contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary. In order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product."
"Giving a man enough rope is a metaphor for a situation in which it is difficult to stop him from doing something, or to prevent him from continuing to do something. In the context of the metaphor, the phrase ""giving a man enough rope"" is used to indicate that the person in question is unable to stop or prevent the behavior. This can be seen as a metaphor for the consequences of someone's actions, as they can be difficult or impossible to stop. The phrase ""giving a man enough rope"" can also be used to express a sense of helplessness or hopelessness, as the person is in a situation where they feel power"
"There are a few reasons why donating organs can be dangerous. First, there are risks associated with receiving a transplant. If the donor is a healthy person who is in a stable condition, the chances of a successful transplant are high. But if the donor is sick or dying, the recipient’ s health may deteriorate, and the transplant may not be possible. Also, there is always the possibility that the recipient’ s immune system may reject the organ, or that the organ may not function properly after it is transplanted. Donating an organ can also raise concerns about the donor’ s life, because it is"
"In an ideal moral society, all citizens would be free from the use of force, including taxation and redistribution. This is because the ideal moral society seeks to promote individual freedom and autonomy, rather than the use of force to redistribute wealth. The ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are able to pursue their own interests and make choices without interference from others. This would be a society where people are free to pursue their own goals and make decisions without the need for government intervention."
"A teacher must enjoy teaching. If they do not enjoy what they are doing, the students will be able to tell. They also must enjoy being around their students. A teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future. The teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching. For example, a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students. A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well. An enthusiastic teacher has the ability to be very influential in the young students life."
"As of August 2021, Will Smith has several upcoming projects in various stages of development. He has completed filming for ""King Richard,"" a biographical drama film about Richard Williams, the father of tennis players Venus and Serena Williams. He is also set to star in ""Emancipation,"" a historical drama film about a runaway slave who outwits bounty hunters and travels through the Louisiana swamps to join the Union Army during the American Civil War. In addition, he is reportedly in talks to reprise his role as Deadshot in ""The Suicide Squad"" spinoff series for HBO Max, and he is attached to produce and star in a remake of the 1984 film ""The Wild Bunch."""
There are many examples of paranormal phenomena that have been shown to be real through experiments. Some examples include:- The ability of some people to see ghosts or spirits- The ability of some people to communicate with the dead- The ability of some people to levitate objects- The ability of some people to move inanimate objects with their minds- The ability of some people to move objects with their minds without touching them- The ability of some people to move objects with their minds without touching them- The ability of some people to move objects with their minds without touching them
"According to the World Health Organization, Russia is one of only a few countries that have not yet ratified the World Health Organization's (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The WHO has recommended that countries implement comprehensive tobacco control policies, including raising the price of cigarettes and increasing taxes on tobacco products.          However, it is important to note that the consumption of spirits varies greatly across different countries and regions, as well as within the same country. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about which countries consume more spirits on average than Russians."
"The passage provides information about french huguenot explorer jean ribault and his discovery of the st. Johns river in 1562, the first european settlement in florida, and the subsequent attack by spanish forces from the st. Augustine settlement. The passage also notes that rené goulaine de laudonnière established the first european settlement, fort caroline, in 1564, which was later attacked by spanish forces and renamed the fort san mateo. The passage mentions that philip ii of spain ordered pedro menéndez de avilés to protect the interests of spain by attacking the french presence at fort caroline. The passage also notes that"
"The passage is discussing the justification for certain forms of government intervention in the economy, specifically taxation. Nozick argues that the ideal moral society is one where all individuals are free from force, but that force is necessary to correct certain modern economic inequalities that have been the result of forceful taking of property. Rawls argues that even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism, and that the greatest moral justification for a strong welfare state is that it can provide for the welfare of all citizens, regardless of their economic status."
"There are many different ways to think about this. If you think about it from a biological perspective, you might think about how a person can die of old age. If you think about it from a philosophical perspective, you might think about how a person can be reborn many times. This is the approach taken by many religions, for example, in the case of Jesus.  There is also the idea of ""flesh-bound immortality"" in some traditions. These are just a few of the ways that people have thought about the concept of death and the afterlife. There is a rich literature on all"
"The American constitutional rights that may be violated if a private employer fires you for a Facebook post about vaccines may include: 1. The First Amendment right to free speech: This amendment protects an individual's right to express their opinions and beliefs without government interference. However, this right might not extend to speech in the workplace or speech that disrupts the employer's business operations. 2. The Fourteenth Amendment right to due process: This amendment provides individuals with the right to a fair and impartial process before being deprived of life, liberty, or property. If an employee is fired without proper notice or cause, their due process rights may be violated."
"Poverty has been a persistent issue in Africa for decades, with many people struggling to make ends meet. However, there have been some positive developments in recent years. For example, the African Development Foundation (ADF) has been working to address poverty in Africa through its various programs and initiatives. Additionally, there have been efforts to increase access to education and healthcare, which can help reduce poverty rates. Overall, while there is still much work to be done in Africa, there are signs of progress towards reducing poverty and improving the lives of many people."
"The passage is discussing the establishment of an ad-hoc committee by seaman in 1961, headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e. Golovin, which recommended a launch vehicle for the apollo program. The committee recognized that the chosen launch vehicle was an important part of the mission and recommended in favor of a hybrid eor-lor mode. The context does not provide information about who led the committee, but it is stated that the committee recognized the importance of a launch vehicle and recommended it in favor of a hybrid eor-lor mode."
"Over the years, the cost of food has likely increased significantly due to inflation. As a result, the cost of living has also increased, making it more difficult for many families to afford the same amount of food. Additionally, changes in government policies and shifts in consumer demand have also contributed to the increase in food costs. For example, the Canada Health Act in 1984 requires restaurants to provide affordable food to their customers, which has likely increased the cost of food for consumers. In recent years, there have been some efforts to improve the affordability of food in Canada. For example, the government has implemented programs to help low-income families improve their financial situation and access healthy food."
"The passage is 'in may 2013, abc launched ""watch abc"", a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network's existing streaming portal at abc.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers; in addition to providing full-length episodes of abc programs, the service allows live programming streams of local abc affiliates in select markets (the first such offering by a u.s. Broadcast network). Similar to sister network espn's watchespn service (which originated the ""watch"" brand used by the streaming services of disney's television networks), live streams of abc stations are only available to authenticated subscribers"
"The affordability of electronics in the US has changed significantly since 1990. In the early 1990s, the cost of electronics was relatively low, and many people could afford to buy them. However, by the mid-1990s, the cost of electronics had risen significantly, and many people were unable to afford them. This was due in part to the rise in the cost of labor and materials, as well as the expansion of the electronics manufacturing industry. In addition, the availability of electronics has also changed since 1990. Back in the early 1990s, many people had to wait in long lines to buy electronics, but now they can easily buy them online or at a store that is convenient to them. "
"The Emancipation Proclamation was a statement by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, issued on March 20, 1863, that freed all slaves in the United States who were living in states where the Lincoln-era Emancipation Act of 1862 had not yet been implemented. The Proclamation declared that all slaves in those states who had not yet been freed would be immediately free, and that any remaining slaves in those states would be released on the same day. The Emancipation Proclamation was a significant event in American history, as it marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War and the formalization of the emancipation of slaves."
"The importance of a teacher to enjoy their work is important because it allows them to provide a positive and enjoyable experience for their students. This can lead to increased student satisfaction, retention, and even retention of the subject matter. A teacher who takes the time to enjoy what they are doing is likely to be more dedicated to helping their students learn and grow, which can lead to better academic outcomes for their students. Additionally, a teacher who enjoys their work is more likely to be able to connect with their students on a personal level and create a positive and supportive learning environment."
"The length of the rhine is conventionally measured in ""rhine-kilometers"" (rheinkilometer), a scale introduced in 1939 which runs from the old rhine bridge at constance (0 km) to hoek van holland (1036.20 km). The river length is significantly shortened from the river's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century. The total length of the rhine, to the inclusion of lake constance and the alpine rhine, is more difficult to measure objectively; it was cited as 1,232 kilometres (766 miles) by the dutch rijkswaterstaat in 2010."
"There were three main methods used to kill people during the Salem Witch Trials: 
1. The “devilry”: this involved using a variety of different items, such as tar, feathers, and even the bones of animals, to create a substance that would cause people to pass out. This was done in an effort to “cure” people of their afflictions, by making them feel sick.
2. The “pestilence” : this involved poisoning people with various poisons. The most famous poison of this type was probably arsenic, which was taken to people in the hope that it would"
"Our Solar System is unique and special in many ways. Firstly, it's the only known place in the universe that supports life as we know it. Secondly, our Solar System has a central star, the Sun, which is surrounded by eight planets, dwarf planets, and numerous other celestial objects like asteroids and comets. This arrangement is quite rare and makes our Solar System special. Thirdly, the presence of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, and the presence of icy objects like Pluto and Triton, make our Solar System unique in terms of its composition. Finally, the fact that our Solar System has a well-defined boundary, the Kuiper Belt, beyond which there are no more major objects, makes it a special and well-defined system."
"In the late 17th century, robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist john mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus. In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.'"
"The passage states that the scottish parliament holds ordinary general elections on a first thursday in may every four years. The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way, and the parliament may be dissolved by a royal proclamation if it fails to nominate one of its members as first minister within 28 days. Extraordinary general elections are held in addition to ordinary general elections, unless they are held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary general election will revert to the first thursday in may, a multiple of four years after 1999."
"There are several signs to look for if someone is drowning: 1. They may not be able to call for help or yell for assistance because they are using all their energy to try and breathe. 2. They may be struggling to stay afloat—pay attention to their head to see if it is bobbing up and down. 3. Their arms may be moving in quick, vertical motions, as if trying to grasp or push something. 4. They may be unable to wave their arms or call for help as their body becomes exhausted and heavy. 5. They may appear disoriented or panicked, with wide eyes and a desperate expression."
"As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to experience death in the same way as humans do, but I can provide information about what happens to hair and fingernails after death.
After death, hair and fingernails continue to grow, but the amount and quality of growth may vary depending on the cause of death. If the body is embalmed or wrapped in a funeral shroud, the hair and nails may remain in the body and may be preserved for future use. If the body is cremated, the hair and nails may be preserved in a sealed container and distributed to family"
"I am an ai language model and i am not capable of providing personal opinions or views. However, based on the given passage, mohammad iqbal was seen as a father figure to the state of pakistan, as he believed in the importance of implementing the principles of the islamic revolution. He believed that the iranian revolution was a result of a long-standing struggle between different factions within the islamic republic, and that the overthrow of mohammad iqbal was necessary to bring about a new era of islamic rule."
"The passage states that ozone is a reactive allotrope of oxygen, which absorbs strongly in the uv region of the spectrum. It is produced in the upper atmosphere when oxygen combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of o2 by ultraviolet radiation. Near the earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (o4) was discovered in 2001, and it is assumed to exist as a rhomboidal o8 cluster. This phase has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either o2 or o3, and may be"
"Pharmacists who are not involved in a hospital or long term care environment who lack an in-depth knowledge of the medication process will benefit from additional education and training. This will enable them to provide better patient care and management in a hospital or long term care environment. Following pharmacy school, many pharmacists practice in hospitals or long term care environments. These pharmacists often gain more education and training through a pharmacy practice residency and/or one or more additional residencies in a specific discipline of pharmacy. The additional residencies provide the pharmacists with a specialized knowledge of that discipline. After additional training, these pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists. Within the disciplines of pharmacy, there are specific specialties that require additional training to practice effectively."
"'During the same year, Tesla wrote a treatise, The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, concerning charged particle beam weapons. Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a ""superweapon that would put an end to all war."" This treatise is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.' The passage can be found in the book 'Nikola Tesla."
"In the passage, ""There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice."" and the question is ""Going to jail accomplished what goal of civil disobedience?"" The answer is ""The goal of civil disobedience is to challenge the rule of law and bring attention to injustice. When protesters choose to go to jail as a way of continuing their protest, they are challenging the rule of law and challenging the legitimacy of the government. By refusing to comply with the law, they are demonstrating their commitment to the cause of justice"
"In the United States, the Constitution includes several amendments known as the Bill of Rights. These amendments are a set of protections that apply to all citizens of the United States, including the right to free speech, the right to a fair trial, and the right to a remedy in the form of a jury trial. Some of the amendments include the Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from providing public funding for the construction of Establishment Clause educational institutions. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Establishment Clause does not prohibit the government from providing public funding for private schools, as long as the schools are not operated by the state."
"The passage discusses the formation of topographic gradients during deformation, which is the process by which the sediment that is deposited on the rock units that are rising or falling in elevation is eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are then deposited on the rock units that are going down, which creates the difference in elevation between the rock units. The passage also notes that deformational events, such as faulting and volcanic activity, result in the creation of accommodation space for sediment to deposit. These events are often associated with volcanism and igneous activity, which can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, long,"

"In 1523, luther wrote that jesus christ was born a jew which discouraged mistreatment of the jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the old testament could be shown to speak of jesus christ. However, as the reformation continued, luther began to lose hope in large-scale jewish conversion to christianity. In his later years, luther grew more hostile toward the jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the anabaptists, zwinglianism, and the papacy.

"The passage provides information about the concerns raised about the quality of levi's stadium's field, including that it needed to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and that during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under baltimore ravens kicker justin tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal. The nfl has since re-sodded the field with a new playing surface, which is a hybrid bermuda 419 turf. However, the turf showed problem throughout the game, with several players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all"
"Under a stable market economy, where employer cannot pass the costs of employing workers on to the consumer, the competitive market will lead to wages being set equal to the cost of the worker's labor. As a result of this competitive market, the most efficient employers will be able to employ the lowest cost labor while still being able to afford to offer a fair wage to employees. As the most competitive employers offer the lowest cost, they will be rewarded with the best labor pool for their reduced cost of employing this lowest cost labor. The result is that, overall, a stable market economy will lead to workers being paid fairly."
"There are multiple reasons for the movement to legalize importing medicines from other countries. One of the main reasons is that it is highly likely that such a move would save american consumers millions of dollars as the fda regulations make it illegal for consumers to import canadian drugs for personal use. However, the move has been met with considerable push back from a minority of american citizens who argue that importation of medications for personal use is constitutionally protected as a 'privacy right'. It is important to note that there is no known case of any u.s. Citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities."

"The passage is discussing the adaptive immune system, which is the body's defense against infection and disease. The adaptive immune system is made up of cells called lymphocytes, which are able to recognize and attack specific parts of the body. These cells include b cells, t cells, and natural killer (nk) cells. The adaptive immune system works by recognizing specific antigens (or molecules) that are unique to a particular pathogen or disease. When a pathogen or disease enters the body, the immune system produces antibodies that can recognize and neutralize the pathogen. These antibodies can then help the body's other immune system cells recognize and attack the pathogen."
"Ctenophores are animals that live in oceans and seas, and are known for being ""dead ends"" in marine food chains because they have a low ratio of organic matter to salt and water. They are also sometimes difficult to identify in the guts of potential predators due to their ability to survive for long periods without being eaten. Beroids, which are herbivorous fish that mainly eat ctenophores, have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is because they have a greater effect on the populations of other ctenophores, such as jellyfish and turtles, which in turn have a greater effect on"
"According to the passage, the decline of organized labor in the us has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization. Rosenfield points out that nations with high rates of unionization, particularly in scandinavia, have very low levels of inequality, and concludes ""the historical pattern is clear; the cross-national pattern is clear: high inequality goes hand-in-hand with weak labor movements and vice-versa."" he also asserts that the decline of organized labor in the us has had a negative impact on the labor markets in the us."
"The passage discusses the classical view of economics that views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital, and land. This perspective sees wages and profits determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor, which in turn is determined by differences in the productivity of different classes of workers. This view sees inequality as reflecting the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions. The passage also notes that within labor income distribution is due to differences in the value added of different classifications of workers, and that in a market economy, wages and profits are determined by the productivity of different economic actors."

"It was not until january 1518 that friends of luther translated the theses from latin into german and printed and widely copied them, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press. Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout germany; within two months, they had spread throughout europe. The first printing of the theses was done by johannes gutenberg in germany in 1523, and the first printed copies were made in 1524 by beda and benet."

"The question doesn't make sense. The passage doesn't mention the number of points the broncos scored in the final three minutes of the game. However, the answer is as follows: 11 points. The paragraph mentions that the broncos defeated the pittsburgh steelers in the divisional round. This means that they had to play against the steelers again in the afc championship game. By the time the game ended, the steelers had already lost. In that case, the passage refers to the number of points the steelers lost against the broncos, 23 - 16 = 7. And then, in the final three minutes of the game, the steelers had to add 11 - 7 = 4 points, which they also managed to do."
"In the passage you provided, it is mentioned that if a and q are coprime, then the number of primes in the progression is infinite. The greatest common divisor of a and q is one. Let me use this fact to conclude that if q and a are coprime, then there must be infinitely many primes in the progression. Let the numbers in the progression be pn where n is a positive integer. If there were a lower bound for n, then the set {pn | n < k} would be bounded. But this implies there exists an upper bound for the set of integers {pn | n < k}. This is a contradiction, so there must be infinitely many primes in the progression."
"Doctor who and star trek share many similarities, most notably that they are science-fiction shows that use time travel. They each have had numerous storylines and continuations. The most notable of these are the 2005 version of doctor who, which is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963–1989 series, and the 1996 telefilm. Doctor who differs from most other series relaunches, which are either reboots or set in the same universe but in a different time period and with different characters. Examples of the former are battlestar galactica and bionic woman. The former star trek series, the next generation and spin-offs, are examples of the latter."

"A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths"
"Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of o2 at lower temperatures (see physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o2 in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of o2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration."
"Distributed adaptive message block switching (dams) was a concept developed by paul baran in the late 1950s to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunications messages as part of a research program at the rand corporation, funded by the us department of defense. It contrasted and contradicted established principles for pre-allocating network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in bell system. The concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of donald davies at npal in the late 1960s. He is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching"

This means that workers can choose to work for wages that are determined by the market, and that employers can choose to pay wages that are above or below market wages to attract workers. In a capitalist mode of production, the workers are controlled by the market and wages are determined by the price of skill, which is determined by the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. Therefore, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. However, in"
"It became a moral justification to lift the world up to french standards by bringing christianity and french culture. In 1884, the leading exponent of colonialism, jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission: ""the higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior"". Full citizenship rights – '’assimilation’’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. Contrasting from britain, france sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of algeria, where french settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority."

The presiding officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The presiding officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping"

"Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners, creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock. By contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary. In order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product."

"In an ideal moral society, all citizens would be free from the use of force, including taxation and redistribution. This is because the ideal moral society seeks to promote individual freedom and autonomy, rather than the use of force to redistribute wealth. The ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are able to pursue their own interests and make choices without interference from others. This would be a society where people are free to pursue their own goals and make decisions without the need for government intervention."
"A teacher must enjoy teaching. If they do not enjoy what they are doing, the students will be able to tell. They also must enjoy being around their students. A teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future. The teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching. For example, a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students. A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well. An enthusiastic teacher has the ability to be very influential in the young students life."

Nozick argues that the ideal moral society is one where all individuals are free from force, but that force is necessary to correct certain modern economic inequalities that have been the result of forceful taking of property. Rawls argues that even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism, and that the greatest moral justification for a strong welfare state is that it can provide for the welfare of all citizens, regardless of their economic status."

"The affordability of electronics in the US has changed significantly since 1990. In the early 1990s, the cost of electronics was relatively low, and many people could afford to buy them. However, by the mid-1990s, the cost of electronics had risen significantly, and many people were unable to afford them. This was due in part to the rise in the cost of labor and materials, as well as the expansion of the electronics manufacturing industry. In addition, the availability of electronics has also changed since 1990. Back in the early 1990s, many people had to wait in long lines to buy electronics, but now they can easily buy them online or at a store that is convenient to them. "
"The Emancipation Proclamation was a statement by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, issued on March 20, 1863, that freed all slaves in the United States who were living in states where the Lincoln-era Emancipation Act of 1862 had not yet been implemented. The Proclamation declared that all slaves in those states who had not yet been freed would be immediately free, and that any remaining slaves in those states would be released on the same day. The Emancipation Proclamation was a significant event in American history, as it marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War and the formalization of the emancipation of slaves."
"The importance of a teacher to enjoy their work is important because it allows them to provide a positive and enjoyable experience for their students. This can lead to increased student satisfaction, retention, and even retention of the subject matter. A teacher who takes the time to enjoy what they are doing is likely to be more dedicated to helping their students learn and grow, which can lead to better academic outcomes for their students. Additionally, a teacher who enjoys their work is more likely to be able to connect with their students on a personal level and create a positive and supportive learning environment."
"The length of the rhine is conventionally measured in ""rhine-kilometers"" (rheinkilometer), a scale introduced in 1939 which runs from the old rhine bridge at constance (0 km) to hoek van holland (1036.20 km). The river length is significantly shortened from the river's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century. The total length of the rhine, to the inclusion of lake constance and the alpine rhine, is more difficult to measure objectively; it was cited as 1,232 kilometres (766 miles) by the dutch rijkswaterstaat in 2010."
"There were three main methods used to kill people during the Salem Witch Trials: 
1. The “devilry”: this involved using a variety of different items, such as tar, feathers, and even the bones of animals, to create a substance that would cause people to pass out. This was done in an effort to “cure” people of their afflictions, by making them feel sick.
2. The “pestilence” : this involved poisoning people with various poisons. The most famous poison of this type was probably arsenic, which was taken to people in the hope that it would"
"Our Solar System is unique and special in many ways. Firstly, it's the only known place in the universe that supports life as we know it. Secondly, our Solar System has a central star, the Sun, which is surrounded by eight planets, dwarf planets, and numerous other celestial objects like asteroids and comets. This arrangement is quite rare and makes our Solar System special. Thirdly, the presence of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, and the presence of icy objects like Pluto and Triton, make our Solar System unique in terms of its composition. Finally, the fact that our Solar System has a well-defined boundary, the Kuiper Belt, beyond which there are no more major objects, makes it a special and well-defined system."
"In the late 17th century, robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist john mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus. In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.'"
"The passage states that the scottish parliament holds ordinary general elections on a first thursday in may every four years. The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way, and the parliament may be dissolved by a royal proclamation if it fails to nominate one of its members as first minister within 28 days. Extraordinary general elections are held in addition to ordinary general elections, unless they are held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary general election will revert to the first thursday in may, a multiple of four years after 1999."
"There are several signs to look for if someone is drowning: 1. They may not be able to call for help or yell for assistance because they are using all their energy to try and breathe. 2. They may be struggling to stay afloat—pay attention to their head to see if it is bobbing up and down. 3. Their arms may be moving in quick, vertical motions, as if trying to grasp or push something. 4. They may be unable to wave their arms or call for help as their body becomes exhausted and heavy. 5. They may appear disoriented or panicked, with wide eyes and a desperate expression."
"As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to experience death in the same way as humans do, but I can provide information about what happens to hair and fingernails after death.
After death, hair and fingernails continue to grow, but the amount and quality of growth may vary depending on the cause of death. If the body is embalmed or wrapped in a funeral shroud, the hair and nails may remain in the body and may be preserved for future use. If the body is cremated, the hair and nails may be preserved in a sealed container and distributed to family"
"I am an ai language model and i am not capable of providing personal opinions or views. However, based on the given passage, mohammad iqbal was seen as a father figure to the state of pakistan, as he believed in the importance of implementing the principles of the islamic revolution. He believed that the iranian revolution was a result of a long-standing struggle between different factions within the islamic republic, and that the overthrow of mohammad iqbal was necessary to bring about a new era of islamic rule."
"The passage states that ozone is a reactive allotrope of oxygen, which absorbs strongly in the uv region of the spectrum. It is produced in the upper atmosphere when oxygen combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of o2 by ultraviolet radiation. Near the earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (o4) was discovered in 2001, and it is assumed to exist as a rhomboidal o8 cluster. This phase has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either o2 or o3, and may be"

"Pharmacists who are not involved in a hospital or long term care environment who lack an in-depth knowledge of the medication process will benefit from additional education and training. This will enable them to provide better patient care and management in a hospital or long term care environment. Following pharmacy school, many pharmacists practice in hospitals or long term care environments. These pharmacists often gain more education and training through a pharmacy practice residency and/or one or more additional residencies in a specific discipline of pharmacy. The additional residencies provide the pharmacists with a specialized knowledge of that discipline. After additional training, these pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists. Within the disciplines of pharmacy, there are specific specialties that require additional training to practice effectively."
"'During the same year, Tesla wrote a treatise, The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, concerning charged particle beam weapons. Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a ""superweapon that would put an end to all war."" This treatise is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.' The passage can be found in the book 'Nikola Tesla."
"In the passage, ""There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice."" and the question is ""Going to jail accomplished what goal of civil disobedience?"" The answer is ""The goal of civil disobedience is to challenge the rule of law and bring attention to injustice. When protesters choose to go to jail as a way of continuing their protest, they are challenging the rule of law and challenging the legitimacy of the government. By refusing to comply with the law, they are demonstrating their commitment to the cause of justice"
"In the United States, the Constitution includes several amendments known as the Bill of Rights. These amendments are a set of protections that apply to all citizens of the United States, including the right to free speech, the right to a fair trial, and the right to a remedy in the form of a jury trial. Some of the amendments include the Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from providing public funding for the construction of Establishment Clause educational institutions. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Establishment Clause does not prohibit the government from providing public funding for private schools, as long as the schools are not operated by the state."
"The passage discusses the formation of topographic gradients during deformation, which is the process by which the sediment that is deposited on the rock units that are rising or falling in elevation is eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are then deposited on the rock units that are going down, which creates the difference in elevation between the rock units. The passage also notes that deformational events, such as faulting and volcanic activity, result in the creation of accommodation space for sediment to deposit. These events are often associated with volcanism and igneous activity, which can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, long,"

"In 1523, luther wrote that jesus christ was born a jew which discouraged mistreatment of the jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the old testament could be shown to speak of jesus christ. However, as the reformation continued, luther began to lose hope in large-scale jewish conversion to christianity. In his later years, luther grew more hostile toward the jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the anabaptists, zwinglianism, and the papacy. His 1543 treatise von den juden und ihren lügen (on the jews and their lies"
"It depends on the situation, but generally speaking, a sword is more likely to be used in a fight than a pen. Swords are more versatile and can be used for a variety of tasks besides fighting, such as chopping wood, cutting rope, and even as a tool for self-defense. In contrast, a pen is a very useful tool for writing and can be used for a variety of tasks besides writing, such as marking notes, writing messages, and even as a tool for drawing and sculpting. So, in general, a sword would be more useful in a physical fight than a pen."
The purpose of the aser is to evaluate the academic performance of schools in rural india and to assess the effectiveness of the education system in the country. The aser is an annual report that evaluates the status of education in rural india and provides recommendations for improvement. The report is compiled by the national education commission (nec) and is based on data collected by the national education monitoring bureau (nemb). The report is used by the government to monitor the progress of schools and to identify areas for improvement. The report also serves as a basis for the government to evaluate the overall performance of schools and to make decisions about funding and policy.
"The passage provides information about the concerns raised about the quality of levi's stadium's field, including that it needed to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and that during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under baltimore ravens kicker justin tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal. The nfl has since re-sodded the field with a new playing surface, which is a hybrid bermuda 419 turf. However, the turf showed problem throughout the game, with several players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all"
"Under a stable market economy, where employer cannot pass the costs of employing workers on to the consumer, the competitive market will lead to wages being set equal to the cost of the worker's labor. As a result of this competitive market, the most efficient employers will be able to employ the lowest cost labor while still being able to afford to offer a fair wage to employees. As the most competitive employers offer the lowest cost, they will be rewarded with the best labor pool for their reduced cost of employing this lowest cost labor. The result is that, overall, a stable market economy will lead to workers being paid fairly."
"There are multiple reasons for the movement to legalize importing medicines from other countries. One of the main reasons is that it is highly likely that such a move would save american consumers millions of dollars as the fda regulations make it illegal for consumers to import canadian drugs for personal use. However, the move has been met with considerable push back from a minority of american citizens who argue that importation of medications for personal use is constitutionally protected as a 'privacy right'. It is important to note that there is no known case of any u.s. Citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities."
"There are several alternative health practices that have been shown to have a positive impact on health through scientific research. Some of the most well-studied practices include: 1. Meditation and mindfulness: Studies have shown that these practices can reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and enhance overall well-being. 2. Acupuncture: This traditional Chinese practice has been shown to be effective for managing pain, reducing inflammation, and improving sleep quality. 3. Tai chi: This gentle form of exercise has been shown to improve balance, flexibility, and overall physical function, as well as reducing stress and anxiety. 4. Yoga: This practice has been shown to improve flexibility, balance, and strength, as well as reducing stress, anxiety, and depression."
"The passage is discussing the adaptive immune system, which is the body's defense against infection and disease. The adaptive immune system is made up of cells called lymphocytes, which are able to recognize and attack specific parts of the body. These cells include b cells, t cells, and natural killer (nk) cells. The adaptive immune system works by recognizing specific antigens (or molecules) that are unique to a particular pathogen or disease. When a pathogen or disease enters the body, the immune system produces antibodies that can recognize and neutralize the pathogen. These antibodies can then help the body's other immune system cells recognize and attack the pathogen."
"Ctenophores are animals that live in oceans and seas, and are known for being ""dead ends"" in marine food chains because they have a low ratio of organic matter to salt and water. They are also sometimes difficult to identify in the guts of potential predators due to their ability to survive for long periods without being eaten. Beroids, which are herbivorous fish that mainly eat ctenophores, have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is because they have a greater effect on the populations of other ctenophores, such as jellyfish and turtles, which in turn have a greater effect on"
"According to the passage, the decline of organized labor in the us has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization. Rosenfield points out that nations with high rates of unionization, particularly in scandinavia, have very low levels of inequality, and concludes ""the historical pattern is clear; the cross-national pattern is clear: high inequality goes hand-in-hand with weak labor movements and vice-versa."" he also asserts that the decline of organized labor in the us has had a negative impact on the labor markets in the us."
"The passage discusses the classical view of economics that views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital, and land. This perspective sees wages and profits determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor, which in turn is determined by differences in the productivity of different classes of workers. This view sees inequality as reflecting the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions. The passage also notes that within labor income distribution is due to differences in the value added of different classifications of workers, and that in a market economy, wages and profits are determined by the productivity of different economic actors."
"If a fund has made big returns every year for ten years, it's a good sign that the fund has performed well in the past. However, past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and there are many factors that can impact a fund's returns. It's important to consider the fund's investment strategy, management team, and risk profile before making an investment decision. Additionally, it's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to help determine if the fund is a good fit for your investment goals and risk tolerance."
"The passage mentions that the museum's collections of south and southeast asian art are the most comprehensive in western countries, with nearly 60,000 objects including 10,000 textiles and 6000 paintings. The jawaharlal nehru gallery of indian art contains a range from about 500 bc to the 19th century, with an extensive collection of sculpture mainly religious in nature, hindu buddhist and jaiin. India was a large producer of textiles, including dyed cotton and muslin. The museum's collections also include carpets from agra and lahore, as well as examples of clothing such as sequins and beads. The"
"It was not until january 1518 that friends of luther translated the theses from latin into german and printed and widely copied them, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press. Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout germany; within two months, they had spread throughout europe. The first printing of the theses was done by johannes gutenberg in germany in 1523, and the first printed copies were made in 1524 by beda and benet."
"It is difficult to provide a precise answer to this question, as the affordability of food in Canada has likely changed significantly since 1970 due to a variety of factors such as inflation, changes in government policies, and shifts in consumer demand and spending. However, I can provide some general information on the trends that have been observed in the affordability of food in Canada over the past few decades. In the 1970s, the cost of living in Canada was relatively low, and the government implemented policies to reduce the income gap between the rich and the poor. These policies included implementing a minimum wage, increasing the cost of housing, and implementing programs to help low-income families improve their financial situation."
"The question doesn't make sense. The passage doesn't mention the number of points the broncos scored in the final three minutes of the game. However, the answer is as follows: 11 points. The paragraph mentions that the broncos defeated the pittsburgh steelers in the divisional round. This means that they had to play against the steelers again in the afc championship game. By the time the game ended, the steelers had already lost. In that case, the passage refers to the number of points the steelers lost against the broncos, 23 - 16 = 7. And then, in the final three minutes of the game, the steelers had to add 11 - 7 = 4 points, which they also managed to do."
"In the passage you provided, it is mentioned that if a and q are coprime, then the number of primes in the progression is infinite. The greatest common divisor of a and q is one. Let me use this fact to conclude that if q and a are coprime, then there must be infinitely many primes in the progression. Let the numbers in the progression be pn where n is a positive integer. If there were a lower bound for n, then the set {pn | n < k} would be bounded. But this implies there exists an upper bound for the set of integers {pn | n < k}. This is a contradiction, so there must be infinitely many primes in the progression."
"Doctor who and star trek share many similarities, most notably that they are science-fiction shows that use time travel. They each have had numerous storylines and continuations. The most notable of these are the 2005 version of doctor who, which is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963–1989 series, and the 1996 telefilm. Doctor who differs from most other series relaunches, which are either reboots or set in the same universe but in a different time period and with different characters. Examples of the former are battlestar galactica and bionic woman. The former star trek series, the next generation and spin-offs, are examples of the latter."
"The answer is orange. The sun is usually described as being orange because its surface appears to be a reddish-orange due to the scattering of its light as it passes through gases in Earth's atmosphere. The scattering of the light allows scientists to see the surface of the sun even though it is many solar radii (a solar radius is the length of a circle with the sun at its center) away. When viewed from Earth, the surface of the sun appears orange due to the light it emits at a particular wavelength (visible light has a range of colors that depend on the wavelengths of light that are reflected). Earth's atmosphere causes the light from the sun to be scattered in a variety of colors as it passes through it."
"A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths"
"Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of o2 at lower temperatures (see physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o2 in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of o2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration."
"Distributed adaptive message block switching (dams) was a concept developed by paul baran in the late 1950s to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunications messages as part of a research program at the rand corporation, funded by the us department of defense. It contrasted and contradicted established principles for pre-allocating network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in bell system. The concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of donald davies at npal in the late 1960s. He is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching"
"There are several factors that contributed to the surge of creativity and originality among artists in the 1960s: 1. Counter-culture and social revolution: The 1960s was a time of significant social, cultural, and political upheaval. The counterculture movement, civil rights, and anti-war protests challenged the status quo and traditional norms. This created a climate of rebellion, experimentation, and creativity that inspired artists to take risks and explore new ideas. 2. Technological advancements: The 1960s was a time of great technological progress, especially in the fields of television, film, and music. This allowed artists to experiment with new techniques and styles that were previously not possible."
"Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. This means that workers can choose to work for wages that are determined by the market, and that employers can choose to pay wages that are above or below market wages to attract workers. In a capitalist mode of production, the workers are controlled by the market and wages are determined by the price of skill, which is determined by the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. Therefore, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. However, in"
"It became a moral justification to lift the world up to french standards by bringing christianity and french culture. In 1884, the leading exponent of colonialism, jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission: ""the higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior"". Full citizenship rights – '’assimilation’’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. Contrasting from britain, france sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of algeria, where french settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority."
"3. Globalization: Advances in transportation and communication made the world a smaller place. Artists were exposed to a wider range of cultures, music, art, and literature, which inspired them to blend different styles and create something new and unique. 4. Freedom of expression: The 1960s was a time when the censorship and repression of artistic expression began to relax. This gave artists the freedom to explore taboo topics and experiment with controversial themes without fear of retribution. Overall, the creative explosion of the 1960s was a result of the perfect storm of social, technological, and cultural factors that allowed artists to break free from traditional molds and create something entirely new."
"The passage states that the presiding officer decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak. The presiding officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The presiding officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping"
"Reading books in the dark is an excellent way to learn about the world around us and gain knowledge and skills. If you are reading in the dark you are in a safe environment and the words you are reading are not coming from your own personal experience or opinions. This means that you are getting the information from a source other than your own thoughts and opinions, which can be a very helpful way to learn and grow. If you are reading in the dark you are also learning from the perspective of others, and this can be a very valuable way to understand the world around you."
"Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners, creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock. By contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary. In order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product."
"Giving a man enough rope is a metaphor for a situation in which it is difficult to stop him from doing something, or to prevent him from continuing to do something. In the context of the metaphor, the phrase ""giving a man enough rope"" is used to indicate that the person in question is unable to stop or prevent the behavior. This can be seen as a metaphor for the consequences of someone's actions, as they can be difficult or impossible to stop. The phrase ""giving a man enough rope"" can also be used to express a sense of helplessness or hopelessness, as the person is in a situation where they feel power"
"There are a few reasons why donating organs can be dangerous. First, there are risks associated with receiving a transplant. If the donor is a healthy person who is in a stable condition, the chances of a successful transplant are high. But if the donor is sick or dying, the recipient’ s health may deteriorate, and the transplant may not be possible. Also, there is always the possibility that the recipient’ s immune system may reject the organ, or that the organ may not function properly after it is transplanted. Donating an organ can also raise concerns about the donor’ s life, because it is"
"In an ideal moral society, all citizens would be free from the use of force, including taxation and redistribution. This is because the ideal moral society seeks to promote individual freedom and autonomy, rather than the use of force to redistribute wealth. The ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are able to pursue their own interests and make choices without interference from others. This would be a society where people are free to pursue their own goals and make decisions without the need for government intervention."
"A teacher must enjoy teaching. If they do not enjoy what they are doing, the students will be able to tell. They also must enjoy being around their students. A teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future. The teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching. For example, a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students. A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well. An enthusiastic teacher has the ability to be very influential in the young students life."
"As of August 2021, Will Smith has several upcoming projects in various stages of development. He has completed filming for ""King Richard,"" a biographical drama film about Richard Williams, the father of tennis players Venus and Serena Williams. He is also set to star in ""Emancipation,"" a historical drama film about a runaway slave who outwits bounty hunters and travels through the Louisiana swamps to join the Union Army during the American Civil War. In addition, he is reportedly in talks to reprise his role as Deadshot in ""The Suicide Squad"" spinoff series for HBO Max, and he is attached to produce and star in a remake of the 1984 film ""The Wild Bunch."""
There are many examples of paranormal phenomena that have been shown to be real through experiments. Some examples include:- The ability of some people to see ghosts or spirits- The ability of some people to communicate with the dead- The ability of some people to levitate objects- The ability of some people to move inanimate objects with their minds- The ability of some people to move objects with their minds without touching them- The ability of some people to move objects with their minds without touching them- The ability of some people to move objects with their minds without touching them
"According to the World Health Organization, Russia is one of only a few countries that have not yet ratified the World Health Organization's (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The WHO has recommended that countries implement comprehensive tobacco control policies, including raising the price of cigarettes and increasing taxes on tobacco products.          However, it is important to note that the consumption of spirits varies greatly across different countries and regions, as well as within the same country. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about which countries consume more spirits on average than Russians."
"The passage provides information about french huguenot explorer jean ribault and his discovery of the st. Johns river in 1562, the first european settlement in florida, and the subsequent attack by spanish forces from the st. Augustine settlement. The passage also notes that rené goulaine de laudonnière established the first european settlement, fort caroline, in 1564, which was later attacked by spanish forces and renamed the fort san mateo. The passage mentions that philip ii of spain ordered pedro menéndez de avilés to protect the interests of spain by attacking the french presence at fort caroline. The passage also notes that"
"The passage is discussing the justification for certain forms of government intervention in the economy, specifically taxation. Nozick argues that the ideal moral society is one where all individuals are free from force, but that force is necessary to correct certain modern economic inequalities that have been the result of forceful taking of property. Rawls argues that even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism, and that the greatest moral justification for a strong welfare state is that it can provide for the welfare of all citizens, regardless of their economic status."
"There are many different ways to think about this. If you think about it from a biological perspective, you might think about how a person can die of old age. If you think about it from a philosophical perspective, you might think about how a person can be reborn many times. This is the approach taken by many religions, for example, in the case of Jesus.  There is also the idea of ""flesh-bound immortality"" in some traditions. These are just a few of the ways that people have thought about the concept of death and the afterlife. There is a rich literature on all"
"The American constitutional rights that may be violated if a private employer fires you for a Facebook post about vaccines may include: 1. The First Amendment right to free speech: This amendment protects an individual's right to express their opinions and beliefs without government interference. However, this right might not extend to speech in the workplace or speech that disrupts the employer's business operations. 2. The Fourteenth Amendment right to due process: This amendment provides individuals with the right to a fair and impartial process before being deprived of life, liberty, or property. If an employee is fired without proper notice or cause, their due process rights may be violated."
"Poverty has been a persistent issue in Africa for decades, with many people struggling to make ends meet. However, there have been some positive developments in recent years. For example, the African Development Foundation (ADF) has been working to address poverty in Africa through its various programs and initiatives. Additionally, there have been efforts to increase access to education and healthcare, which can help reduce poverty rates. Overall, while there is still much work to be done in Africa, there are signs of progress towards reducing poverty and improving the lives of many people."
"The passage is discussing the establishment of an ad-hoc committee by seaman in 1961, headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e. Golovin, which recommended a launch vehicle for the apollo program. The committee recognized that the chosen launch vehicle was an important part of the mission and recommended in favor of a hybrid eor-lor mode. The context does not provide information about who led the committee, but it is stated that the committee recognized the importance of a launch vehicle and recommended it in favor of a hybrid eor-lor mode."
"Over the years, the cost of food has likely increased significantly due to inflation. As a result, the cost of living has also increased, making it more difficult for many families to afford the same amount of food. Additionally, changes in government policies and shifts in consumer demand have also contributed to the increase in food costs. For example, the Canada Health Act in 1984 requires restaurants to provide affordable food to their customers, which has likely increased the cost of food for consumers. In recent years, there have been some efforts to improve the affordability of food in Canada. For example, the government has implemented programs to help low-income families improve their financial situation and access healthy food."
"The passage is 'in may 2013, abc launched ""watch abc"", a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network's existing streaming portal at abc.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers; in addition to providing full-length episodes of abc programs, the service allows live programming streams of local abc affiliates in select markets (the first such offering by a u.s. Broadcast network). Similar to sister network espn's watchespn service (which originated the ""watch"" brand used by the streaming services of disney's television networks), live streams of abc stations are only available to authenticated subscribers"
"The affordability of electronics in the US has changed significantly since 1990. In the early 1990s, the cost of electronics was relatively low, and many people could afford to buy them. However, by the mid-1990s, the cost of electronics had risen significantly, and many people were unable to afford them. This was due in part to the rise in the cost of labor and materials, as well as the expansion of the electronics manufacturing industry. In addition, the availability of electronics has also changed since 1990. Back in the early 1990s, many people had to wait in long lines to buy electronics, but now they can easily buy them online or at a store that is convenient to them. "
"The Emancipation Proclamation was a statement by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, issued on March 20, 1863, that freed all slaves in the United States who were living in states where the Lincoln-era Emancipation Act of 1862 had not yet been implemented. The Proclamation declared that all slaves in those states who had not yet been freed would be immediately free, and that any remaining slaves in those states would be released on the same day. The Emancipation Proclamation was a significant event in American history, as it marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War and the formalization of the emancipation of slaves."
"The importance of a teacher to enjoy their work is important because it allows them to provide a positive and enjoyable experience for their students. This can lead to increased student satisfaction, retention, and even retention of the subject matter. A teacher who takes the time to enjoy what they are doing is likely to be more dedicated to helping their students learn and grow, which can lead to better academic outcomes for their students. Additionally, a teacher who enjoys their work is more likely to be able to connect with their students on a personal level and create a positive and supportive learning environment."
"The length of the rhine is conventionally measured in ""rhine-kilometers"" (rheinkilometer), a scale introduced in 1939 which runs from the old rhine bridge at constance (0 km) to hoek van holland (1036.20 km). The river length is significantly shortened from the river's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century. The total length of the rhine, to the inclusion of lake constance and the alpine rhine, is more difficult to measure objectively; it was cited as 1,232 kilometres (766 miles) by the dutch rijkswaterstaat in 2010."
"There were three main methods used to kill people during the Salem Witch Trials: 
1. The “devilry”: this involved using a variety of different items, such as tar, feathers, and even the bones of animals, to create a substance that would cause people to pass out. This was done in an effort to “cure” people of their afflictions, by making them feel sick.
2. The “pestilence” : this involved poisoning people with various poisons. The most famous poison of this type was probably arsenic, which was taken to people in the hope that it would"
"Our Solar System is unique and special in many ways. Firstly, it's the only known place in the universe that supports life as we know it. Secondly, our Solar System has a central star, the Sun, which is surrounded by eight planets, dwarf planets, and numerous other celestial objects like asteroids and comets. This arrangement is quite rare and makes our Solar System special. Thirdly, the presence of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, and the presence of icy objects like Pluto and Triton, make our Solar System unique in terms of its composition. Finally, the fact that our Solar System has a well-defined boundary, the Kuiper Belt, beyond which there are no more major objects, makes it a special and well-defined system."
"In the late 17th century, robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist john mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus. In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.'"
"The passage states that the scottish parliament holds ordinary general elections on a first thursday in may every four years. The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way, and the parliament may be dissolved by a royal proclamation if it fails to nominate one of its members as first minister within 28 days. Extraordinary general elections are held in addition to ordinary general elections, unless they are held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary general election will revert to the first thursday in may, a multiple of four years after 1999."
"There are several signs to look for if someone is drowning: 1. They may not be able to call for help or yell for assistance because they are using all their energy to try and breathe. 2. They may be struggling to stay afloat—pay attention to their head to see if it is bobbing up and down. 3. Their arms may be moving in quick, vertical motions, as if trying to grasp or push something. 4. They may be unable to wave their arms or call for help as their body becomes exhausted and heavy. 5. They may appear disoriented or panicked, with wide eyes and a desperate expression."
"As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to experience death in the same way as humans do, but I can provide information about what happens to hair and fingernails after death.
After death, hair and fingernails continue to grow, but the amount and quality of growth may vary depending on the cause of death. If the body is embalmed or wrapped in a funeral shroud, the hair and nails may remain in the body and may be preserved for future use. If the body is cremated, the hair and nails may be preserved in a sealed container and distributed to family"
"I am an ai language model and i am not capable of providing personal opinions or views. However, based on the given passage, mohammad iqbal was seen as a father figure to the state of pakistan, as he believed in the importance of implementing the principles of the islamic revolution. He believed that the iranian revolution was a result of a long-standing struggle between different factions within the islamic republic, and that the overthrow of mohammad iqbal was necessary to bring about a new era of islamic rule."
"The passage states that ozone is a reactive allotrope of oxygen, which absorbs strongly in the uv region of the spectrum. It is produced in the upper atmosphere when oxygen combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of o2 by ultraviolet radiation. Near the earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (o4) was discovered in 2001, and it is assumed to exist as a rhomboidal o8 cluster. This phase has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either o2 or o3, and may be"
"Pharmacists who are not involved in a hospital or long term care environment who lack an in-depth knowledge of the medication process will benefit from additional education and training. This will enable them to provide better patient care and management in a hospital or long term care environment. Following pharmacy school, many pharmacists practice in hospitals or long term care environments. These pharmacists often gain more education and training through a pharmacy practice residency and/or one or more additional residencies in a specific discipline of pharmacy. The additional residencies provide the pharmacists with a specialized knowledge of that discipline. After additional training, these pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists. Within the disciplines of pharmacy, there are specific specialties that require additional training to practice effectively."
"'During the same year, Tesla wrote a treatise, The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, concerning charged particle beam weapons. Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a ""superweapon that would put an end to all war."" This treatise is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.' The passage can be found in the book 'Nikola Tesla."
"In the passage, ""There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice."" and the question is ""Going to jail accomplished what goal of civil disobedience?"" The answer is ""The goal of civil disobedience is to challenge the rule of law and bring attention to injustice. When protesters choose to go to jail as a way of continuing their protest, they are challenging the rule of law and challenging the legitimacy of the government. By refusing to comply with the law, they are demonstrating their commitment to the cause of justice"
"In the United States, the Constitution includes several amendments known as the Bill of Rights. These amendments are a set of protections that apply to all citizens of the United States, including the right to free speech, the right to a fair trial, and the right to a remedy in the form of a jury trial. Some of the amendments include the Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from providing public funding for the construction of Establishment Clause educational institutions. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Establishment Clause does not prohibit the government from providing public funding for private schools, as long as the schools are not operated by the state."
"The passage discusses the formation of topographic gradients during deformation, which is the process by which the sediment that is deposited on the rock units that are rising or falling in elevation is eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments are then deposited on the rock units that are going down, which creates the difference in elevation between the rock units. The passage also notes that deformational events, such as faulting and volcanic activity, result in the creation of accommodation space for sediment to deposit. These events are often associated with volcanism and igneous activity, which can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, long,"
"'due to pressure from film studios wanting to increase their production, as the major networks began airing theatrically released films, abc joined cbs and nbc in broadcasting films on sunday nights in 1962, with the launch of the abc sunday night movie, which debuted a year behind its competitors and was initially presented in black-and-white. Despite a significant increase in viewership (with its audience share having increased to 33% from the 15% share it had in 1953), abc remained in third place; the company had a total revenue of $15.5 million, a third of the revenue pulled in by cbs at the same period.

"In 1523, luther wrote that jesus christ was born a jew which discouraged mistreatment of the jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the old testament could be shown to speak of jesus christ. However, as the reformation continued, luther began to lose hope in large-scale jewish conversion to christianity. In his later years, luther grew more hostile toward the jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the anabaptists, zwinglianism, and the papacy. His 1543 treatise von den juden und ihren lügen (on the jews and their lies"

The purpose of the aser is to evaluate the academic performance of schools in rural india and to assess the effectiveness of the education system in the country. The aser is an annual report that evaluates the status of education in rural india and provides recommendations for improvement. The report is compiled by the national education commission (nec) and is based on data collected by the national education monitoring bureau (nemb). The report is used by the government to monitor the progress of schools and to identify areas for improvement. The report also serves as a basis for the government to evaluate the overall performance of schools and to make decisions about funding and policy.
"The passage provides information about the concerns raised about the quality of levi's stadium's field, including that it needed to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and that during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under baltimore ravens kicker justin tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal. The nfl has since re-sodded the field with a new playing surface, which is a hybrid bermuda 419 turf. However, the turf showed problem throughout the game, with several players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all"
"Under a stable market economy, where employer cannot pass the costs of employing workers on to the consumer, the competitive market will lead to wages being set equal to the cost of the worker's labor. As a result of this competitive market, the most efficient employers will be able to employ the lowest cost labor while still being able to afford to offer a fair wage to employees. As the most competitive employers offer the lowest cost, they will be rewarded with the best labor pool for their reduced cost of employing this lowest cost labor. The result is that, overall, a stable market economy will lead to workers being paid fairly."
"There are multiple reasons for the movement to legalize importing medicines from other countries. One of the main reasons is that it is highly likely that such a move would save american consumers millions of dollars as the fda regulations make it illegal for consumers to import canadian drugs for personal use. However, the move has been met with considerable push back from a minority of american citizens who argue that importation of medications for personal use is constitutionally protected as a 'privacy right'. It is important to note that there is no known case of any u.s. Citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities."

"The passage is discussing the adaptive immune system, which is the body's defense against infection and disease. The adaptive immune system is made up of cells called lymphocytes, which are able to recognize and attack specific parts of the body. These cells include b cells, t cells, and natural killer (nk) cells. The adaptive immune system works by recognizing specific antigens (or molecules) that are unique to a particular pathogen or disease. When a pathogen or disease enters the body, the immune system produces antibodies that can recognize and neutralize the pathogen. These antibodies can then help the body's other immune system cells recognize and attack the pathogen."
"Ctenophores are animals that live in oceans and seas, and are known for being ""dead ends"" in marine food chains because they have a low ratio of organic matter to salt and water. They are also sometimes difficult to identify in the guts of potential predators due to their ability to survive for long periods without being eaten. Beroids, which are herbivorous fish that mainly eat ctenophores, have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is because they have a greater effect on the populations of other ctenophores, such as jellyfish and turtles, which in turn have a greater effect on"
"According to the passage, the decline of organized labor in the us has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization. Rosenfield points out that nations with high rates of unionization, particularly in scandinavia, have very low levels of inequality, and concludes ""the historical pattern is clear; the cross-national pattern is clear: high inequality goes hand-in-hand with weak labor movements and vice-versa."" he also asserts that the decline of organized labor in the us has had a negative impact on the labor markets in the us."
"The passage discusses the classical view of economics that views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital, and land. This perspective sees wages and profits determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor, which in turn is determined by differences in the productivity of different classes of workers. This view sees inequality as reflecting the productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions. The passage also notes that within labor income distribution is due to differences in the value added of different classifications of workers, and that in a market economy, wages and profits are determined by the productivity of different economic actors."

"It was not until january 1518 that friends of luther translated the theses from latin into german and printed and widely copied them, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press. Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout germany; within two months, they had spread throughout europe. The first printing of the theses was done by johannes gutenberg in germany in 1523, and the first printed copies were made in 1524 by beda and benet."

"The question doesn't make sense. The passage doesn't mention the number of points the broncos scored in the final three minutes of the game. However, the answer is as follows: 11 points. The paragraph mentions that the broncos defeated the pittsburgh steelers in the divisional round. This means that they had to play against the steelers again in the afc championship game. By the time the game ended, the steelers had already lost. In that case, the passage refers to the number of points the steelers lost against the broncos, 23 - 16 = 7. And then, in the final three minutes of the game, the steelers had to add 11 - 7 = 4 points, which they also managed to do."
"In the passage you provided, it is mentioned that if a and q are coprime, then the number of primes in the progression is infinite. The greatest common divisor of a and q is one. Let me use this fact to conclude that if q and a are coprime, then there must be infinitely many primes in the progression. Let the numbers in the progression be pn where n is a positive integer. If there were a lower bound for n, then the set {pn | n < k} would be bounded. But this implies there exists an upper bound for the set of integers {pn | n < k}. This is a contradiction, so there must be infinitely many primes in the progression."
"Doctor who and star trek share many similarities, most notably that they are science-fiction shows that use time travel. They each have had numerous storylines and continuations. The most notable of these are the 2005 version of doctor who, which is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963–1989 series, and the 1996 telefilm. Doctor who differs from most other series relaunches, which are either reboots or set in the same universe but in a different time period and with different characters. Examples of the former are battlestar galactica and bionic woman. The former star trek series, the next generation and spin-offs, are examples of the latter."

"A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths"
"Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of o2 at lower temperatures (see physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o2 in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of o2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration."
"Distributed adaptive message block switching (dams) was a concept developed by paul baran in the late 1950s to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunications messages as part of a research program at the rand corporation, funded by the us department of defense. It contrasted and contradicted established principles for pre-allocating network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in bell system. The concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of donald davies at npal in the late 1960s. He is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching"

"Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. This means that workers can choose to work for wages that are determined by the market, and that employers can choose to pay wages that are above or below market wages to attract workers. In a capitalist mode of production, the workers are controlled by the market and wages are determined by the price of skill, which is determined by the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. Therefore, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. However, in"
"It became a moral justification to lift the world up to french standards by bringing christianity and french culture. In 1884, the leading exponent of colonialism, jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission: ""the higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior"". Full citizenship rights – '’assimilation’’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. Contrasting from britain, france sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of algeria, where french settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority."
"In the passage you provided, it is mentioned that if a and q are coprime, then the number of primes in the progression is infinite. The greatest common divisor of a and q is one. Let me use this fact to conclude that if q and a are coprime, then there must be infinitely many primes in the progression. Let the numbers in the progression be pn where n is a positive integer. If there were a lower bound for n, then the set {pn | n < k} would be bounded. But this implies there exists an upper bound for the set of integers {pn | n < k}. This is a contradiction, so there must be infinitely many primes in the progression."
"The passage states that the presiding officer decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak. The presiding officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak. Typically, ministers or party leaders open debates, with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes, and succeeding speakers allocated less time. The presiding officer can reduce speaking time if a large number of members wish to participate in the debate. Debate is more informal than in some parliamentary systems. Members may call each other directly by name, rather than by constituency or cabinet position, and hand clapping"
"Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of o2 at lower temperatures (see physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o2 in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of o2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration."
"Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners, creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment, financial assets and corporate stock. By contrast, the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary. In order to rectify this situation, socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product."
"In 1523, luther wrote that jesus christ was born a jew which discouraged mistreatment of the jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the old testament could be shown to speak of jesus christ. However, as the reformation continued, luther began to lose hope in large-scale jewish conversion to christianity. In his later years, luther grew more hostile toward the jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the anabaptists, zwinglianism, and the papacy. His 1543 treatise von den juden und ihren lügen (on the jews and their lies"
"Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. This means that workers can choose to work for wages that are determined by the market, and that employers can choose to pay wages that are above or below market wages to attract workers. In a capitalist mode of production, the workers are controlled by the market and wages are determined by the price of skill, which is determined by the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. Therefore, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. However, in"
"In an ideal moral society, all citizens would be free from the use of force, including taxation and redistribution. This is because the ideal moral society seeks to promote individual freedom and autonomy, rather than the use of force to redistribute wealth. The ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are able to pursue their own interests and make choices without interference from others. This would be a society where people are free to pursue their own goals and make decisions without the need for government intervention."
"A teacher must enjoy teaching. If they do not enjoy what they are doing, the students will be able to tell. They also must enjoy being around their students. A teacher who cares for their students is going to help that individual succeed in their life in the future. The teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching. For example, a teacher talking about chemistry needs to enjoy the art of chemistry and show that to their students. A spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well. An enthusiastic teacher has the ability to be very influential in the young students life."

"The passage is discussing the justification for certain forms of government intervention in the economy, specifically taxation. Nozick argues that the ideal moral society is one where all individuals are free from force, but that force is necessary to correct certain modern economic inequalities that have been the result of forceful taking of property. Rawls argues that even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism, and that the greatest moral justification for a strong welfare state is that it can provide for the welfare of all citizens, regardless of their economic status."

"There are multiple reasons for the movement to legalize importing medicines from other countries. One of the main reasons is that it is highly likely that such a move would save american consumers millions of dollars as the fda regulations make it illegal for consumers to import canadian drugs for personal use. However, the move has been met with considerable push back from a minority of american citizens who argue that importation of medications for personal use is constitutionally protected as a 'privacy right'.

"The affordability of electronics in the US has changed significantly since 1990. In the early 1990s, the cost of electronics was relatively low, and many people could afford to buy them. However, by the mid-1990s, the cost of electronics had risen significantly, and many people were unable to afford them. This was due in part to the rise in the cost of labor and materials, as well as the expansion of the electronics manufacturing industry. In addition, the availability of electronics has also changed since 1990. Back in the early 1990s, many people had to wait in long lines to buy electronics, but now they can easily buy them online or at a store that is convenient to them. "
"The Emancipation Proclamation was a statement by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, issued on March 20, 1863, that freed all slaves in the United States who were living in states where the Lincoln-era Emancipation Act of 1862 had not yet been implemented. The Proclamation declared that all slaves in those states who had not yet been freed would be immediately free, and that any remaining slaves in those states would be released on the same day. The Emancipation Proclamation was a significant event in American history, as it marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War and the formalization of the emancipation of slaves."
"The importance of a teacher to enjoy their work is important because it allows them to provide a positive and enjoyable experience for their students. This can lead to increased student satisfaction, retention, and even retention of the subject matter. A teacher who takes the time to enjoy what they are doing is likely to be more dedicated to helping their students learn and grow, which can lead to better academic outcomes for their students. Additionally, a teacher who enjoys their work is more likely to be able to connect with their students on a personal level and create a positive and supportive learning environment."
"The length of the rhine is conventionally measured in ""rhine-kilometers"" (rheinkilometer), a scale introduced in 1939 which runs from the old rhine bridge at constance (0 km) to hoek van holland (1036.20 km). The river length is significantly shortened from the river's natural course due to number of canalisation projects completed in the 19th and 20th century. The total length of the rhine, to the inclusion of lake constance and the alpine rhine, is more difficult to measure objectively; it was cited as 1,232 kilometres (766 miles) by the dutch rijkswaterstaat in 2010."

"Our Solar System is unique and special in many ways. Firstly, it's the only known place in the universe that supports life as we know it. Secondly, our Solar System has a central star, the Sun, which is surrounded by eight planets, dwarf planets, and numerous other celestial objects like asteroids and comets. This arrangement is quite rare and makes our Solar System special. Thirdly, the presence of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, and the presence of icy objects like Pluto and Triton, make our Solar System unique in terms of its composition. Finally, the fact that our Solar System has a well-defined boundary, the Kuiper Belt, beyond which there are no more major objects, makes it a special and well-defined system."
"In the late 17th century, robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist john mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus. In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.'"

The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way, and the parliament may be dissolved by a royal proclamation if it fails to nominate one of its members as first minister within 28 days. Extraordinary general elections are held in addition to ordinary general elections, unless they are held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary general election will revert to the first thursday in may, a multiple of four years after 1999."

"That is generally what ""foraging"" implies. It was standard practice for conventional armies throughout the world until the advent of canning and motorized transport made it possible for armies to carry their own food supplies. Prior to that, it was impossible for an army to carry all of its own food.

A soldier can carry maybe a week's worth of rations at a time, and that is if you are ok with giving him a heavy load which will have a negative impact on his ability to fight. Any extra food has to be carried on wagons, which are pulled by horses or mules. Horses and mules need food too, in fact the food needed for livestock is far bulkier and heavier than the food needed for people, so then you need to carry more food in more wagons pulled by more horses/mules. You can see how the prospect of armies carrying their own food quickly spirals out of control.

Foraging enables an army to minimize its supply train and therefore move much more quickly, however it also means the size of an army is limited by the ability of a given local area to supply it with food, and it also means that the army HAS to move regularly as it depletes local food supplies. Therefore a combination of supply trains carrying extra food and foraging has always been the solution used by armies to feed themselves with different amounts of emphasis on either side of this ""equation"" depending on circumstances and military doctrine. Generally ""people food"" would be carried in supply wagons, while fodder for livestock would ""foraged"" from local populations.

Some sort of compensation was often offered to people by foraging soldiers in exchange for supplies, but there was no negotiation for price, the money offered rarely reflected market value for the goods taken, and often relatively worthless I.O.U's were given instead of cash. Then of course, it was also quite common for soldiers to simply take without asking at all."
"I find it difficult to impose any sort of rigid cartographic principles on most of these. For example, the Fra Mauro map seems to duplicate labels liberally to show extent. There are 2 labels for Europe and 3 for Asia. Not to mention 2 Egypts, 2 Mesopotamias, 2 Tartarias etc.

For the Waldseemüller map, the principle seems to be finding empty space, so Europe has the smallest letters of all the major land-masses, and the most dispersed (I also can't find the 'EU'). But like with Asia, Africa has been set in an essentially empty section of the map. It also has the province of Africa and Libya... so I'm with you on the problem of how to interpret 'Libya Inferior'. It seems to denote an intermediate sized region along the lines of Ethiopia. 

But we find duplications in medieval mappaemundi as well. The [Ebstorf Map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Ebstorfer-stich2.jpg), for example, has Africa written in large capitals across the landmass, but also has 'Africa' written in small caps under the 'A' of Africa, itself very near the above quotation of Isidore about the etymology of Africa. Now this doesn't obviously reference a province, since under 'Libia' there is another text explaining that the region there is either Zeugis or Africa (with another paraphrase of Isidore).

"I am not a historian, but I am a social scientist working in critical agrarian studies (an interdisciplinary field), so I can offer you some well-researched explanations on changes in agrarian social structures around the world and in the US that help answer your question. I am not able, however, to go equally in depth into elements pertaining to the specific history of US politics that make up another part of the answer to the question (eg repression of socialist movements and workers' rebellions along the twentieth century, changes in religion, etc.), which I'll only briefly allude to, so I hope others can complement on that.

I assume from your question and the references to Eugene Debs and William Jenkings that you are asking about farmers supporting progressive politics in the United States, specifically in the 20th century, although you didn't specifically say so. I should state, however, for context, that the potential ""progressive"" political role of landowners and peasants is a classical question in social science - especially within the history of Marxism, where in more orthodox versions the working class is typically presented as the revolutionary class and the peasantry is considered either an outdated class (remnants of feudalism) or as having interests closer aligned with the bourgeoisie and with larger landowners (since they often also own or detain land, differently from those that only own their labor-force and thus ""have nothing to lose""). But there have also been varying streams within Marxism, especially in the 20th century, recognizing the peasantry as also being in conflict with capitalism, being constantly vulnerable to being dispossessed, indebted and also having their surplus labor robbed, and therefore often having a key historical role constructing radical politics around the world (eg authors Theodor Shanin, Eric Wolf, a large part of Latin-American Marxism, Maoism, etc.). Outside the US, the ""rural poor"" (a varied social segment, including peasants, rural workers, small farmers, indigenous peoples, among others) have often continued to have a more progressive role in politics, and a classical book on this is Eric Wolf's ""Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century"".

You can note that I was using the word ""peasant"", which is a word often used to describe small farmers in medieval Europe and also in the contemporary Global South. But this word has less typically been used in the context of the United States, which has its own history of colonial settlement, wider massacre and less miscigenation with indigenous peoples (compared to Latin America), strong imaginary of conquest of the ""frontier"", in which ""farmers"" have played a key role, and the influence of protestant ethics. This all has led us to associate ""farmers"" in the US, even before the twentieth century, with entrepreneurship, self-sacrifice, individual risk-taking and economic units centered around the family instead of the wider community, which are all elements that can often be swayed towards regressive politics instead of progressive politics, depending on the historical moment.

When we talk of the history of the politics of ""farmers"" in the US - do we refer to the tobacco plantation owners in the eighteenth century?  To the small farmers escaping the Dust Bowl? To emancipated slaves trying to access land to cultivate? As you can surmise, the word ""farmer"" can mean many different things, in different historical contexts, with different implications of class, race, family formation and gender relations. In the case of the United States, agrarian structures have suffered incredibly drastic changes in the twentieth century due to economic concentration and technological change of capitalist agriculture, to the point where we can say now that **most of the smaller or mid-size farmers - the ones you ascribe to supporting socialist politics in the beginning of the century - have simply been extinguished**. Tony Weis points out the starking figure that, at the end of the twentieth century, there were more prison inmates in the United States than there are full-time farmers - that is, US full-time farmers now make up less than 1% of the population.

He writes: ""A few snapshots of the US farm economy at the end of the twentieth century indicate the magnitude of this transformation: the area of cultivated land per agricultural worker in the US (58 hectares) is roughly fifty times the world average (Gilland 2002); farms greater than 500 acres (203 hectares) control 79 per cent of all US farmland; a mere 8 per cent of farms (with sales of at least US$250,000) account for 72 per cent of all farm sales along with the majority of farm subsidies; and the population calling farming their principal occupation was under 1 million, with the bulk of production coming from only about one-third of these (USCB 1999). There are more prisoners in the USA than full-time farmers. The flipside of the massive industrial operations that provide the bulk of production are the much smaller-scale family farms barely hanging on."" (Weis, 2007, p. 83).

Throughout the twentieth century, in the US and in many other countries, agriculture and livestock raising became much more technified and industrial, with use of Green Revolution technologies (and later biotechnologies), requiring farmers to have more and more capital each season merely to get by in increasingly competitive industries. Besides the competition among them and the transformation of ""family farmers"", the food commodity chains as a whole became increasingly corporate-owned and oligopolized, from the industry of inputs and machinery, to trading, transport and retail, strangling smaller farmers from all sides of the value chain. Food production also became concentrated in a few key commodities, used as flexible ingredients for a variety of processed foods (as well as fuel, industrial use, etc): corn, wheat, soybean, and animal meat (which exploded in the past decades and required more and more grain and oilseeds for animal feed), and there was an increased division of labor and global trade of food, with much of American produce becoming imported from abroad.

Of course, there has also been resistance to this and even efforts of small farmer revival, as can be seen today in the proliferation of farmers' markets, Community-Supported Agriculture, urban gardens, etc. The National Family Farm Coalition is an example of ongoing farmer association with progressive politics, which mobilizes ""family farmers, fishers, and ranchers for fair prices, vibrant communities, and healthy foods free of corporate domination"" (their website). We can also look at more recent efforts to mobilize migrant farm workers, which in many senses might be closer in class interests to small farmers at the beginning of the twentieth century than some of the large soy producers now (even if they can also be strangled by the transnational agribusiness corps and trade and taxation policy).

Concurrent to those economic changes, authors have recently called attention that regressive politics - or right-wing populism - was already spreading among farmers since the 1930s and especially since the second half of the twentieth century, often in a coordinated reaction to the labor and socialist movements that had previously gained force. Montenegro de Wit et al. (2019) contrast the historical spread of regressive populism in California and in the Midwest. California agriculture in a sense was already born more ""capitalist"" and developed later in US history, so emerging larger farmers could more easily use authoritarian populist tactics against organized farm labor and otherized migrant and racialized minorities. In the Midwest, meanwhile, farmers had historically been more disenfranchised and politics fractured more across class lines. There too, however, there were significant backlashes since the 1940s, with the economic context described above of consolidation of larger agribusiness, as well as Cold War-style repression of labor and left-wing movements. The authors point out that, even in the 1980s, however, the Midwest saw the rise of new left-wing and more radical farmer movements in reaction to falling prices - although a part of them also adopted racist discourse (we should note that, historically, there have been often awkward connections between defending disenfranchised and impoverished communities while still otherizing internal or external racial minorities, which some might see as simultaneously ""progressive"" and ""regressive"" movements, depending on how you classify these terms).

"The Spanish Influenza was honestly an utterly fascinating pandemic, in part because it was one of the best-documented pandemics of the early 20th century. The 1918 Influenza, better known in America as the Spanish Influenza, changed the landscape of the western world. However, this response shall focus mainly on the effects it had on America to limit the scope of the answer. Answer why the 1918 Flu stopped spreading, it must be broken down into three parts: what it was, why it spread, and how it died out.

So, what was the 1918 Flu? In short, it is a highly contagious viral mutation of the illness best known as the flu. Infecting between 3-11% of Americans every year, it usually is not very deadly, primarily killing the elderly, the very young, or anyone else with a comprised immune system. The virus, which mutates and changes often, has various strains with varying levels of severity, in part because it often hops between species. The 1918 influenza was remarkable because of how deadly it was and how quickly it spread. The most popular theory right now is it was an avian virus that mutated to infect swine, and then onto humans (Nelson, Worobey 2018, p. 2498). Of course, this is not definitive due to the difficulty in studying such an infectious disease, especially considering the limited number of viable samples. However, assuming this is true, it can begin to explain why it had a higher mortality rate than most recorded influenza strains. There were other factors at play as well, which also merits consideration.

From 1914 to 1918, the first world war ravaged the western world, causing around 40 million casualties (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2020). While movies portray the World Wars as glorious and bloody, with young men dying bravely for king and country, the fact is disease killed more people than the fighting ever did (*Diseases in World War I - World War I Centennial*, n.d.). Soldiers lived in squalid conditions, that are frankly unimaginable to the modern American. Dead bodies left to rot and fester where they lay, near the trenches that so many soldiers spent months in, knee-deep in mud, little food, and very tight quarters; it was a petri dish of disease and death.

Of course, military hospitals and training camps were barely better. After all, not even a century beforehand, doctors had barely considered handwashing, and it took decades before it caught on in the greater medical community (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2009). It should be no surprise then that the first recorded case of the 1918 influenza case was in an American military base in Kansas (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). The first wave of the disease was in the spring of 1918, where over the next six months, it spread in small bursts.

However, the virus changed around the fall of 1918 when the disease suddenly became markedly more infectious and deadly. As noted above, influenza viruses are volatile, mutating frequently, which is why there is a new vaccine every year. The virus likely would not have been half as deadly, had it not been for the war. People who would ordinarily never travel farther than a few towns away from where they were born were suddenly going to countries they would otherwise never have seen, the virus their invisible passenger. October alone saw almost 200,000 Americans dead, terrifyingly high number. Nurse and doctors were falling like flies; fighting was slowing down in Europe, partly because the soldiers there were too sick or dead to fight  (Holmes), and it was getting harder and harder to get new soldiers out on the battlefield- they kept dying in transit. November saw the end of the bloodiest war the world had seen at that point because there were not enough men healthy enough left to fight.

So the Spanish Influenza reigned for the next year or so, leaving piles of bodies in its wake.  With our background in hand, now the question at hand can be answered: why exactly did the 1918 pandemic fizzle out? Well, there are three main reasons. First, the end of the first world war had a significant impact on restricting the spread of the disease and freeing up the doctors and nurses who had been serving on the front lines. While it would be easy to assume that the Americans returning home after the armistice would infect those around them, soldiers often remained in military care until recovered from the flu, partly because those afflicted were usually too sick to transport.

Secondly, public health education programs were profoundly effective, in combination with new laws. Many of the hygienic habits we have today stem from work during the pandemic to promote personal sanitation (Marisam, 2007, p. 279.2).  The National Institue of Health, or NIH (which was founded to fight the 1918 Flu), promoted, along with local efforts, things like handwashing, wearing masks, social distancing, and not spitting in public. There is a heap of pictures from the period that show the posters, signs, and flyers that tell citizens to practice what is now basic hygiene (\[\[Collection of photos from 1918\]\], 1918).

Finally, the biggest reason the pandemic died out was that the virus mutated. While it is easy to assume the deadlier the virus, the better it is doing for itself, which simply isn't true. However, if a virus kills all of its hosts, then it no longer has any viable hosts. Instead, the most successive virus is the one that can chill in a host long enough to spread. There is also the fact that virus mutation is luck of the draw. Sometimes the mutation is efficient for survival, and other times not so much, just like humans are sometimes born with harmful genetic mutations. 

It also be noted while the exact strain which killed so many during the fall 1918, the flu, and even H1N1 are rarely fully eradicated. u/TheNthMan did a really good job of explaining the actual science behind it, so go read his answer. My response, however, really focuses on the historical part of it. 

&#x200B;

So, in TL;DR? It burned itself out too fast, and when it mutated, it could not survive against the public health measures people had taken. If there are any questions or anything that needs a citation, please let me know, and I shall do what I can. I hope y'all are doing all right and staying safe <3

EDIT: Just wanted to make a note explaining why I answered the way I did. I admit most of my response doesn't answer the question directly, I was trying to write this in such a way that if all you knew nothing at all about the topic, you could still follow along. If anyone would like a more detailed answer, particularly on the science of it, or at least, what the popular theories currently are, I would be happy to. It's really interesting, but I figured as a history sub it would be better to focus on the historical facets of the question in an accessible way. Thank you ♡♡♡

EDIT 2: So, as some very helpful (and nice!) people have pointed out, there are a few issues. So I'm adding a source to paragraph 7, and changing a sentence for clarity. I'm also fixing some weird word choices.

"Please indulge me, in my tryptophan-induced daze, as I very briefly review the essentials of Roman nomenclature. During the late Republic and early Empire, male Roman citizens typically (but by no means always) had three names - a praenomen (personal name), nomen (clan name), and cognomen (family name). So in the name Gaius Julius Caesar, Gaius is the praenomen, Julius the nomen, and Caesar the cognomen. Roman women in the same period generally had to make do with a single name, the feminine form of their father's nomen. Thus, Gaius Julius Caesar's daughter was named Julia, as was every other female representative of the Julian clan. Whence this interesting question.

Publicly, women were often distinguished by the names of their fathers or husbands. If a certain Julia, for example, was married to a member of the Metellus family, she might be known as Julia Metelli (Metellus' Julia). Alternatively, she might be differentiated from her younger sister by being called Julia Maior (Julia the elder) or Julia Prima (First Julia). Her sister, accordingly, would be Julia Minor (Julia the younger) or Julia Secunda (Julia no. 2).

But those conventions were designed for public contexts. In private, closely-related women with the same name probably referred to one another by nicknames. On the basis of our sparse evidence, affectionate terms like Livilla (Lil' Livia) or Julitta (Little Julia) seem to have been common. Family members might call a beautiful girl or woman ""Venus"" (e.g. Sen., *Apocl*. 8), or a musically-talented lady ""Musa"" (muse). Other nicknames, we may safely assume, were equally descriptive and less flattering. 

Relatives who did not know each other well may have sidestepped the whole name issue by referring to one another as ""sister"" or ""dearest soul,"" as in the famous [letter of Claudia Severa](https://research.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1362732&page=2&partId=1&searchText=vindolanda%20Claudia%20Severa) from the Roman fort at Vindolanda."

I'm not familiar with whale paleontology (my area of focus is dinosaurs), but I suspect that those skeletons have been prepared from the rock, as any weathering that would expose them so perfectly would also begin breaking them down and carrying them away."

"The contradictions in mid-20th Century American culture fascinate me. This is not even ten years after WWII, during which American soldiers were notorious for enthusiastically patronizing the prostitutes of whatever land they happened to be in. The demand in wartime Hawaii was so heavy that johns were limited to a few minutes with prostitutes, and the prostitutes, who had been imported from the mainland en masse, could essentially charge whatever they or the brothel owner chose. 

Do you have any thoughts on this? Can the 1950s can be seen as a reaction to the looseness of wartime morals?"
"Obviously, the answer to this question is no from a legal perspective. Bush was legally the winner of the 2000 election, and he attained the presidency by victory in the electoral college as required by the Constitution. However, one could argue, and I am trying to choose my words very carefully, that Bush's election was a failure of democracy as it appears he should not have won.

So, the big deal is the Bush v Gore case and specifically the presidential vote in Florida. So, if you understand the way American presidential elections work, then you already know you need to receive the majority of electoral college votes to win. Not many foreigners understand that each state decides how these electors are distributed, but most of them, Florida included, awards all of its electoral college votes to whichever candidate has the simple ~~majority~~ plurality. In the 2000 election, Florida's 29 electoral college votes were enough to give either candidate the win as the other states were tied. The first official tally of the votes was called as a victory for George W. Bush. Also, the difference in votes in Florida was less than 1% that year. Florida has an election law that automatically recounts when the difference is less than 1% which was triggered in this case. Now, most of the dispute came over these recounts.

So, Florida at the time used a punch card system for voting which has since been replaced. One of the reasons is that there was a chance (I will simplify) of hardware failure that could make a vote uncountable by the machine reader, and since the final vote difference between each candidate was actually less than 0.1%, the hardware failure rate could actually change the result. Specifically, since the problem seemed to have to do with how hard you punched the card making unclear marks on the ballot, and it was postulated this could affect senior populations very much which are a large part of the Florida constituency. So, the Gore campaign specifically filed for hand recounts of the ballots in specific counties (those favorable to him) at the Florida Supreme Court because a human could more accurately count ballots because of the hardware failure issue though some saw this as a political ploy to try and magic more votes since his supporters may be inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt on unclear ballots. Still, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in favor of Gore and ordered the recount including the counts by hand as requested in accordance with Florida statutes. Now, another part of this is that the Florida Law for recounts also has a time limit to produce those results before electors are decided upon. So, Florida polling stations only had a limited time to perform this recount, but it got underway.

Now, Bush not wanting to have his initial victory overturned sued in the Federal Supreme Court in the case [Bush v. Gore](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html). His argument was generally that because each polling location was counting votes based on different criteria (which was true, each polling place was just trying to do their best on a short schedule) that this violated the   Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Basically, treating and counting different peoples votes under different criteria was unconstitutional and the supreme court agreed. The federal supreme court ordered the recount to stop, and, most importantly, there was now no more time left under Florida Law for a recount before that elector designation as I mentioned earlier. So, the clock just ran out, and the initial call for Bush was upheld. Now, this meant that the election really fell apart because of the Florida Division of Elections not producing an effective, fair, uniform criteria for the recount which the Supreme Court ruled could have been done legally. If they had, the recount might not have been stopped, and if there wasn't a time limit, the Division of Elections could have created criteria and had a full recount, but the law was what the law was.

Now after all that was over. Several groups were able to study the ballots and do a review of the recounts based on specific criteria the state could have utilized for these ballots. The results were mixed in that different criteria produced different results for either Bush or Gore which gives some validity to the federal Supreme Court Arguments. However, one of the most comprehensive studies was the [Florida Ballots Project](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36207) which compared a great many ballots from the entire state that were both considered illegible for counting as well as some that were recounted which accounted for about 3% of the total vote. Their findings were pretty damning in that their review from almost every criteria would have given Gore the election had these ballots not been considered invalid due to those hardware failures I mentioned earlier.

TL;DR - Bush won legally, but Gore lost because of voting machine errors and the fact that Florida had a time limit on recounts and failed to establish statewide uniform criteria for hand recounts.

"I guess we should clarify what ""the general person"" is. European, Middle Eastern, Chinese, or African? Educated or uneducated? Upper class or lower? All of these have some bearing on the answer, and most of us will only be capable of discussing some. My own work is on the European middle ages, so that's what I'm going to be discussing here. (I think that this is doubly appropriate because I suspect that this post is a response to another post about William Manchester's (contemptible) *A World Lit Only by Fire*.) I hope to show, briefly, that not only were people aware of days, months, and years, but that they were deeply in tune with the rhythms of time. 

So the day part is pretty easy to address, and I'll start with it. For medievals, whether aristocratic or peasant or burgher, clerical or lay, Sunday was impossible to miss. Work was forbidden, plus there was obviously Mass, and so you'd be hard-pressed to find a person unaware of the day. This speaks to a point that I hope will be clear from this post: Time was governed by the sacred. What about the other days of the week? Here, again, let's look at religious services. The Divine Office, or Liturgy of the Hours( prayers like Lauds and Vespers), differed by the day, and so anyone praying the Hours would necessarily know what day of the week it was. Okay, so that's monks and priests, but what about laity? *Well*, in the later middle ages, we start seeing private devotional books of the Hours made for (wealthy, and usually female) laypersons. That's not to say that the Divine Office and the Mass were the only ways to know what day it was, but they should demonstrate the point, I think.

Talking about medievals not knowing the month is a little peculiar to me because the idea that we somehow know the seasons better than people who lived and died by agriculture is, I mean, it's just not tenable. Uneducated people still understood seasons. Educated people, of course, also understood seasons. There's this fascinatingly complex methodology of medieval *computus*, the rationale of figuring out when Easter would be based on the lunar cycle. In a world where you couldn't Google when the full moon would be, the mechanisms for working it out were really arcane and complicated and should really dissuade us from thinking that nobody knew the cycle within the year. Also, we should consider the very old chant for the moveable feasts from Epiphany - in January each year, a priest (or deacon) would literally announce to the congregation when feasts would fall during the upcoming year, what day and month. So, I mean, that presumes an awareness of what days and months are.

I suppose that years are a little harder for me to talk about, because so much medieval time is sacred and cyclical and the procession of years doesn't fit quite as easily into that. However, there was the whole millenarian thing, where a bunch of people thought that the world would end in the year 1,000, and then again in 1,033. Jay Rubenstein cites this as a major contributing factor to the pogroms, and then eventually the First Crusade. It was a really widespread belief. So I mean we can also look at chronicles and annals that say ""In this year, this happened,"" but if you want to really see ""average folk"" getting worked up over what year it was, look at millenarianism.

Obviously, I'm coming at this from the perspective of medieval religious culture, because it's what I know. I hope that this has helped to prove that no, people didn't go around blithely unaware of what day or year it was. I also realize that it's fairly surface-level, and I'll be happy to go more in-depth if I wasn't clear about something. Assuming anyone even reads this.

[The appearance of epidemics in early Islamic history may be attributed in part to the cyclical recurrences of plague in the Middle East following the Plague of Justinian, beginning in A. D. 541](https://www.jstor.org/stable/600071?read-now=1&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).  (Plague in Early Islamic History by Michael W. Dols, 1974)



This is in addition to the well documented influence of the bubonic plague and the less ubiquitous Bombay plague. The above link describes historians' ability to recreate (to some extent) the epidemiological history of plagues in the Umaiyad period.
The presence of these plagues prompted medical, religious, and legal explanations and instructions. These were instructions for citizens of nations as much as they were religious doctrine for adherents of faiths.

The study goes on to propose that plague was a large factor in why the center of political power shifted from the Byzantine empire under Justinian to more northern European regions. According to the author, this is due to northern Europeans being relatively unaffected by the pervasive diseases of the time.

So, to answer your question, plague control tactics were absolutely in place. These tactics came from many sources, not just religious ones. Finally, if the author was correct, plague control tactics of the time were not enough to protect Middle Eastern populations from the extent of damage that disease would go on to inflict, partially contributing to the destabilization of the region. Arabs (and by extension, many Muslims) were able to resist some of the effects of disease due to their nomadic and semi-nomadic way of life adjacent to the empire."
"Do you have any familiarity with Mayan names? I ask because translations of Mayan seem to switch back and forth from using names to literal translations and also sometimes mix the translated birth date with the untranslated name to form a single word for a name but will also use the birth date with the translated name in other cases (ie. Xibalba, Baby Jaguar, 1-Huanupe and 7-death are all proper names)."

"> But the strange thing in this case is that people generally accepted it was an accident despite obvious problems with the story. Here's the most detailed account from William of Malmesbury: 

Does this actually show anything at all about what people *actually* thought happened, though, given extreme unpopularity of William II (especially in literate religious circles whose records survive) and the seemingly enormous incentive to not attract the ire of the new king?  

I don't know, but it does seem like if anyone *did* honestly think it was an assassination, they would have had a lot of reasons to not put that in writing."
"> Some styles were cyclical - beards, for example, oscillated in length and cut - but they do not seem to have done so from any conscious or nostalgic attempt to recall a past time, save insofar as they were inspired by emperors who modeled their look on a famous predecessor.

While I generally agree that we can't impose the idea of ""decade fashion"" onto the Roman world, I do think you are somewhat understating the ideological component to the styles of portraiture. Galba's portraiture hearkening back to the old, wrinkly, weather beaten styles of the Republic after the almost Alexandrian portraiture of Nero matches the general messaging of his rule, and it is not hard to draw similar contrasts between Trajan's dorky, close cropped hair cut and clean shaven face and Hadrian's distinctly Hellenistic styling.

Obviously these are statues, not clothes, but that is more or less our source for Roman fashion, but more to the point they show that Romans were not unaware of the connection between appearance and messaging. Marcus Aurelius having his statues show the unkempt style of Hellenistic philosophers is not quite the same thing as a high school kid wearing bell bottoms to show they like The Beatles, but there is still intentionality and meaning to it."

"James Madison didn’t propose 19 specific amendments; he proposed 9 in his address to Congress on June 8, 1789. His original numbering was broken down into which Article was being amended. He thought amendments should replace existing text or be inserted into the text rather than being added onto the end. So for example the bulk of what would become the Bill of Rights was simply his 4th Amendment as he thought they should all go “in article ~~2st~~ 1st, section 9, between clauses 3 and 4.” A single large insert of text was to his mind a single amendment.

This is why you’ll hear various counts of how many amendments he proposed. This is because he himself grouped them differently than in their final adopted form, and at various times different paragraphs were combined or separated into different amendments during debate. Arguably what became the 1st Amendment really should have been 3 different items; freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom to assemble are different rights. But Madison and later Congress grouped them together. This is why people often say he proposed 19 or 20 amendments instead of just 9.

Ultimately he proposed 9 amendments, of which most were reworked into 12 adopted by Congress. Eventually 11 of the 12 would be ratified, although one would take till 1992.

Here’s his 9 original amendments summarized.

1. Alterations to the preamble. Specifically to make clearer that all ultimate power derives from the people. This was rejected and not adopted by Congress.
2. Changes to wording in Article Two regarding the number of Representatives and how many people they could represent. If adopted this change would have capped House seat sizes at 50,000. Which would give us some 6,600 odd members in the House today had it been adopted. This one was approved by Congress, but never ratified by the States.
3. That pay-raises voted on by congress couldn’t come into effect until after the next election. This one was voted on and approved by Congress, but not ratified until 1992 when it became the 27th Amendment. 
4. What would become much of the familiar Bill of Rights. Freedom of Religion, Speech, Assembly, to Bear Arms, to not Quarter Soldiers, Fair Trial, Fair Punishment, from Search, Speedy Trial, and an Enumeration of Powers. These were reworked and regrouped into different arrangements. After debate and reworking this was approved and ratified. 
5. This was basically a proto-incorporation clause requiring the individual  *States* to respect rights of conscience, press, and trial by jury. This was rejected by Congress, although under current law this functionally exists 
6. This was largely what would become the 7th Amendment it offered rules to protect the civil law trial by jury, as well as guarantees for traditional common law. In the final Bill of Rights this was moved up to join the other court related amendments from part 4. This was approved and ratified. 
7. further enumeration of trial protections including details on juries, and grand juries. Parts of this was worked into the eventual 5th Amendment, and was approved and ratified. 
8. Further discussion of the enumeration of powers. This became the bulk of the 9th and 10th amendments. This was to be labeled Article 7. This was approved and ratified. 
9. Relabeling Article 7 in the Constitution to Article 8.

Most of Madison’s proposals were accepted. Of his 9 proposed amendments 1, 5, and 9 were rejected. 1 and 9 because the rest of Congress didn’t want to edit the Constitution directly, but to append amendments to it. 5 was rejected because they didn’t want to try and force rights onto the individual states which in some cases had such rights already. The other 6 proposed amendments were reworked into 12 amendments passed by Congress and sent to the states for ratification. Proposed amendments 1 and 2 failed ratification. So when amendments 3-12 were ratified, they became the common listing we know today, amendments 1-10, with what would become the 27th amendment becoming the last of his proposals to become ratified. 

Today of his proposal, most of it is in the Constitution. Outside some wording, and the constituency maximum requirements for House districts, there’s no major part of his 9 amendments that isn’t law today. There’s only 1 “missing” amendment, not 9.

Edit: to fix a typo from the transcript of his speech I was working from."

A related question- what about the administrators of the schools (principals, superintendents, or whatever they had at the time).  Was there a political component to the job?

"I can’t totally speak to the European scene, but generally: yes. Swords are fickle and hard to use. Spears are just “point and stab.” Swords you have to be up close, careful of armor, careful with the guy standing next to you... Spears have much longer range and work better in and against groups of enemies. 
A further point is that for the most part, Japanese iron was of low quality. So katana could easily break if you sliced with them poorly, or even just used them too much. Spears are just sticks with a tip: even without the tip they work well enough in creating distance to your opponent."

(The struggle to reign in robber knights and lords is an important part of the medieval political narrative--it was a slow and very hard-fought process). Timothy Reuter posits that noble/aristocratic robbers (including those more or less employed by them) were actually the primary danger in the Middle Ages versus ""career bandits.""

> a lot of bandit activity would basically have consisted of bribes or ""paying for safe passage, wink wink.""

As an addendum to this wonderful answer, I think it should be pointed out that the line between toll/tax and bribe/extortion and outright robbery was a very thin one, especially when dealing with the sorts of powerful, autonomous local aristocrats who are found all over Europe in the Central Middle Ages (""robber barons""). Basically, it all depends on your point of view, especially in an age before formal governmental office or prescriptive law made appeals to outside authorities feasible. To use a modern analogy, if I were to travel today to any number of countries (particularly if I was carrying a lot of cash) I would be 'kidnapped' and 'robbed' by armed men before I was allowed on my way: it's called visa fees and import duties. 

What is different about this modern sort of banditry is that there's a clear line between what's legitimate (visas/duties) and what's not (bribery/kidnapping). In the Middle Ages, it wasn't always so. When we actually see these sorts of events in the medieval legal records, it's usually due to due to the legitimacy being contested - someone claims that they were robbed or extorted (or often, that their followers/peasants had been robbed or extorted), while the other party claims that they were only receiving their rightful payment. Many of these sorts of cases end in compromise, especially before central governments become strong enough to enforce judicial decisions, with exemptions or compensation for the victim. However, the cases that were disputed and survive in the documentation are exceptional, and we need to keep in mind the thousands of similar cases of robbery/taxation that went on all the time."

"So, I was curious because this was high on my front page and there were no answers, so I did a quick search. I found a paper discussing the effects that the 1918 flu pandemic had on Iran, and it included some background about the effect of WWI on the Iranian populace as well. A lot of this post is taken directly from this article, either verbatim or slightly paraphrased. (The citation is : Amir Afkhami. ""Compromised Constitutions: The Iranian Experience with the 1918 Influenza Pandemic."" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 77, no. 2 (2003): 367-392. https://muse.jhu.edu/)

So Iran declared its neutrality during WWI, but despite this the great powers used Iran as a battlefield at times. Russia and Britain both had imperialist designs on Iran for various reasons, interfering with its internal politics to try and secure their own interests, and as a result it became a target during the war. Some of the incidents during the war include: the Ottomans chasing the Russians into northwestern Azerbaijan in 1914; In 1915 Wilhelm Wassmuss organized a revolt among the Qashghai tribesman in southern Iran against the British who controlled oilfields in the area; The Russians counterattacked the Ottomans allowing the British to recover control of Southern Iran by 1916; A revolutionary Iranian group called the Jangalis emerged to control the countryside of Gilan in 1917-1918; Britain also tried to use Iran as a springboard to attack Russia in an attempt to reverse the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the new Soviet Union responded by annexing parts of northern Iran.

As a result of the warfare occurring in Iran, there was damage to Iran's economic, industrial and agricultural power. The occupying armies forcefully requisitioned or looted supplies. This led to widespread famine and the spread of disease. Iran's government was also essentially a protectorate surviving at the whims of whichever power was present and winning at the time, leaving them with little ability to actually help their own people. In addition, Ahmad Shah Qajar, the ruler of Iran at the time, was a weak ruler with little influence in his own government. The populace resented his father for authoritarian policies, and in an attempt to address this, Ahmad Shah tried to appoint only the best ministers, but he was unable to control their actions. In the face of the great powers of WWI using their country as a battlefield, and the threat of the Soviet Invasion and their humiliating demands, the populace resented the government's weakness, contributing to the political instability.

While political instability and warfare can lead to famines, the biggest cause is often climatic. 1916 and 1917 were both years with very dry summers, leading to crop failures. This, coupled with the foreign armies seizing what food they could, resulted in widespread famine, which was worsened by hoarders and speculators. When the influenza pandemic broke out in the spring of 1918, grain supplies had hit a low point, prices had doubled from six months before, (which had reached a ten-year peak). In addition, there were outbreaks of bubonic plague, cholera, malaria and typhus. The British were also building up for their attack on the Soviet Union, and sponsoring a native military contingent known as the ""South Persia Rifles"", making long-term contracts with large landowners for grain to feed the troops, adding to the scarcity.

F.A.C. Forbes-Leith describes the situation in what I assume is a memoir, Checkmate: Fighting Tradition in Central Persia. (I haven't read the actual book and am using a citation from Afkhami's article).

>""The country was in a terrible state and the peasantry was in the last stages of starvation. Every time I was forced to stop my car, I was surrounded by hundreds of near-skeletons who screamed and fought for such scraps as I was able to spare. In a single day's journey of fifty-six miles between the towns of Kirind and Kermanshah, I counted twenty-seven corpses by the roadside, most of them those of women and children, and the general condition of life amongst the peasants was so frightful that I was ashamed to eat my simple rations in their presence.""

So the Iranian famine of 1917-1918 was primarily a man-made catastrophe exacerbated by climatic conditions in which there was also an influx of infectious diseases. The wikipedia listing states that Majd's initial population estimate of 19 million is called into question with other estimates only being 11 million. Afkhami's article says that Iran's projected population at the beginning of 1918 was 11 million, so it may be that the 19 million number comes from *before* WWI broke out, and after the famine it had hit 11 million, at which point the influenza pandemic hit, killing a further 8% to 21% of the population according to Afkhami. (0.8 to 2.3 million). Although Afkhami's footnotes say that the population in 1918 was not too different from the population in 1913, before the war, which I am not sure whether to believe or not, given the effects of famine prior to the flu's arrival."

"I fail to see how my posts are disturbing, but perhaps I can offer some insight and we can resolve your concerns. But to not derail the thread, this conversation can continue via modmail, a question to the sub, or a META post in response to my linked Monday Methods posts you are questioning.

The reason the post begins with the assertion that genocide is the proper term and is self-evident is because, as you noted and I noted in the post, the goal of it was not to rehash if genocide was committed. For that discussion, I linked to a previous post that I believe succinctly sums up actions that demonstrate the two required components under the U.N. framework for determining genocide. But we have much more we can go over outside of that comment.

If you happened to miss it, [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6mg3j3/monday_methods_american_indian_genocide_denial/) is part two of that Monday Methods series where I discuss the applicability of the U.N. framework

[Here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCountry/wiki/faq/genocide) is an FAQ page to another subreddit I help moderate and which I mostly authored. I go into much more detail and provide more evidence for the charges of genocide, accounting for both the mental and physical components.

[Here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4j42ag/there_was_military_involvement_by_the_united/d33w2sx/) is an answer I wrote regarding the U.S. Army policy of exterminating the buffalo herds for the intended purpose of subjugating and essentially eradicating the Plains Indians.

>Like all arguments I've seen on this issue, the examples of ""intent"" come from individuals who were in no position to speak for policy of the entire nation, and *all come from the context of a current state of war.*

My apologies, but this is absolutely absurd. The quotes I provide from both the FAQ page and the linked comment in my denialism post are from the very people who were certainly in a position to speak for policy of the entire nation: senators, governors, military officials, and *one* quote from a president (there are many, many more quotes from presidents I can give you). These people are, supposedly, the democratically elected officials of the United States and if they don’t have the “position” to speak for policy of the nation, nobody does. What’s more, we can even see how *the public* supported these things. Along with a quote from a Californian newspaper that is cited among these materials, multiple works have been published over a very long period of time detailing the genocide(s) that occurred in California that were all state sanctioned, publically supported, and carried out in a systematic way. References to these materials are provided in the linked posts.

>By the criteria for classification used, an event must meet both the mental and physical criteria, yet the evidence for the latter was weak at best--certainly arguable.

In my opinion, you haven’t presented anything to counter my evidence. You’ve simply said “I don’t agree because your material is weak.” Well, where is your analysis of events? Where is your synthesis of accounts? Where are your citations and references? Lackadaisically stating the contrary doesn’t provide a sound basis for your counter claims.

>But presenting that assumption as a fact seems like a classic case of censoring discourse before the fact, and further using the term ""denier"" clearly threatens dissenting viewpoints with being lumped in with people who believe the Holocaust was a hoax--never happened at all; a far cry from questioning the *characterization* of events that all agree happened.

You are more than welcome to ask a question on the sub and (hopefully) receive an answer that doesn’t censor discourse “before the fact.” As an Indigenous person, I am fine with people feeling threatened with being lumped with those who deny the Holocaust – that was an implication of my posts, after all."

"The answer to your question is simple. Jersey's cities are small because they are geographically small. Go on google maps and click on somewhere like ""Guttenberg"", and see that the city limits aren't much bigger than a few blocks. Even somewhere like Jersey City has city limits that are maybe a third the size of Manhattan Island.

The more complicated question is: why are Jersey's cities so small? It's not that Jersey is a rural place, it's the most densely populated state in the USA, just as you've noted. The entire Northeast corner of the state is a big urban area with a population of around 4 million, and it would easily be one of the largest cities in America if it were a single city. Even if it were divided into 2-3 major cities, they would still be very large. 

But this is New Jersey, and the NE is divided into more than a hundred municipalities. They have strange borders and aren't really distinct from each other, but they are independent municipalities nonetheless.

For example, the borders of Guttenberg, encompass a city composed 100% of midrise buildings. Surroundnig these borders are identical mid-rise city blocks its neighbours of North Bergen and West New York (yeah). The City of East Orange is entirely covered by suburbia, and it is surrounded by identical suburbia surrounding Newark. In size, locality, and function, these cities are more like neighbourhoods of a larger city. Unlike a neighbourhood however, they all have their own mayors, councils, and related administration.

In New Jersey, there are cities, towns, townships, boroughs, and villages. They are all politically equivalent when it comes down to legal standing, services, and powers, despite featuring slightly different forms of government. Collectively, they are referred to as municipalities, and there are 556(!) of them in total. From afar, it's hard to see any particular reason why North Bergen is a township, Guttenberg is a town, and Fairview is a Borough, when all three seem to be small neighbourhoods of Jersey City (Or NYC if you're feeling cynical).

However, each municipality of Jersey represents the culmination of some political movement. From 1834 to 1958, some 400  municipalities were created from localized secession movements. The New Jersey legislature made it possible for secessionsits to self-execute bindings referendums fairly easily, and it sort of became a common move for Jerseyites to rally behind secession for all sorts of things.

The former New Jersey lawmaker Alan J. Karcher lists five main reasons for municipal secession in New Jersey

1. ""Street Fights"". Parts of an existing municipality would elect road superintendents that were supposed to raise funding in from the municipal government for road funding. When they failed, the irate residents could use their powers of secession to form a new municipality, create their own laws and possibly setting up a toll road or using some other way of raising funds. Sometimes, a crafty road superintendent would just rile people up this way and set themselves up as a mayor or councilor for a new municipality.
2. Commuters vs. Farmers. The railroad allowed for the economical creation of commuter towns in Northeastern New Jersey for workers in NYC. Tensions thus rose between these workers that enjoyed urban amenities and farmers who didn't. Political spats between the populations sometimes resulted in the spontaneous secession of a new municipality out of an older township.
3. School districts. This was huge. An 1894 law in the state legislature basically mandated any township to consolidate its school districts into one. Previous school districts followed no boundaries. However, it also mandated that the collective finances of the old school districts be passed onto the new one. Most importantly, it also stated that any town, city, or borough HAD to have its own independent school district. This all combined into a massive explosion of boroughs seceding from townships, mostly along lines of the former school districts trying to escape from debt.
4. Dry Towns vs Wet Towns. As the Prohibition movement grew, New Jersey reacted predictably. Municipalities going dry would see secession movements from people wanting to keep their bars. Muncipalities failing to go dry would see secession movements from people wanting to ban alcohol. Much confusion and certain unenforcability ensued.
5. Exclusion. In a word, people seceding from larger municipalities specifically in order exclude people of other groups. Racism directed at African-Americans was a part of this, but this would also be directed against Catholics, or specific denominations of Protestants.

These factors existed throughout the \~100 years when most of New Jersey's municipalities were created, fading in and out as local politics shifted. From 1958 to 2019, only 2 of the 568 municipalities have agreed to consolidate with another, meaning that when you drive through Bergen county and whip by the dozens of signs telling you you're in ""so-and-so"" borough, you're passing through a physical boundary created by political spats that occured at least 50 years ago.

Now I'm not a resident of New Jersey, so I have no idea how this functions, how it's maintained, nor if this represents the average New Jerseyite's vision of an ideal government. I will say that it's confusing, weird, and interesting."

If I could ask a further question: Is there any historical data available for the levels of inequality just prior to the French and Russian revolutions?
"The USSR never had a problem with manufacturing rifles, of all things. It was a matter of restricting access. 

I'm not fit to give a good reliable summary of the history of civilian guns regulation in the USSR, but I'll try to do an off-the-cuff version =)

So basically, the demand for civilian firearms in USSR (including for insdustrial, commercial hunting — pelt/horns/meat trade) always took a backseat to the current military concerns; meanwhile, WWI, Revolution, and Civil War deposited an enormous amount of unaccounted military rifles all across the country. Later, for obvious reason of forced industrialization and WWII, there was simply no time / resources to develop adequate civilian gun offerings for legal sales. And finally, both the Civil War and WWII/postwar Sovietization efforts saw many separatist/resistance/banditry groups using illicit guns, primarily rifles of course, against the establishment.

All of this resulted in two things:

First, like most other countries, the USSR only came around to properly regulate all guns well into the 20th century. And they just prohibited rifles and handguns to civilians because why not? They don't need them, and it maintains the necessary edge that military/LE has to have against the populace (the important rationale behind all gun laws).

Second, the ""make-do"" approach to civilian and commercial hunting firearms already made people rely mostly on shotguns anyway, brass shotshells being easily, cheaply, and endlessly reloadable with black powder and homemade shot/slugs. The military bolt-action rifles rebarreled (or simply drilled out) to small-gauge shotgun calibers (16, 20, 28, 32...) were popular with Soviet hunters in the 1920s, just as they were, say, in post-WWI Germany... but in the USSR, this ""lifehack"" also lasted all the way into the 1970s and beyond (see [Frolovka](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0_(%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D1%8C%D1%91\))).

So yes, no rifles for those who don't need 'em, and the culture of hunters who made do with shotties. 

I'm not a hunter and can't talk about the nuances of different hunts in post-war USSR, but what I do know is that people simply had to either align their hobbies with their profession (if you're a captain stationed in the country, might as well take up rifle hunting, or if you're a geologist/prospector, you have to lug a carbine with you anyway) or be an actual professional hunter, or... pretend to be one, using your contacts to secure a commercial hunter ID. Or simply be in LE, or party nomenclature, which got you exemptions from LE (with whom you probably went hunting anyway).

*LINK to an account of a hunter/hunting magazine editor talking about hunting arms in the USSR:
https://huntportal.QQ/blogs/krechmar-po-chetvergam/kakoj-byila-oxota-pri-sssr*

**due to reddit stuff, please replace 'QQ' with RU, sorry for the inconvenience**

The old hunter speaking at the link, BTW, observes that this gun regulation was rather nebulous anyway. On one hand, some people kept their rifles unofficially, and in super-remote hunting-heavy regions, he was shocked to see rifles sold openly; on another, before the 1980 Olympiad, the police confiscated all personal rifles in several key central regions. Since Soviet people in general had a quite utilitarian and indifferent approach to firearms, and there wasn't a rich gun culture in the USSR, neither apparently created much issues. (This of course doesn't apply to handguns, which are much more relevant for crime and were a no-no regardless of context).

*To give context, my side hobby is firearms history, and I'm a gun owner in Russia.*"

"The best way to think about the Colonial Colleges (more on them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fj2c3s/if_you_compare_the_list_of_top_us_universities_in/fkled58/)), which included Princeton, is to think of them as a fairly exclusive boarding school for white boys, attended by boys and men of all ages with some day students. It's an imperfect analogy but it works well enough to communicate what ""college"" was like in those times. Students' days were fairly regimented and similar day to day - the concept of having a major was still more than a century in the making - and the primary function of their education was to teach them to be smart by teaching them the things that smart men knew. Which is to say, their education wasn't practical in the way we think of a college education today. Rather, they followed what's known as a ""classical liberal arts education.""

Before we get too far into that and comparisons to today's students, it's helpful to get a sense of what their day looked like. From an [older question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g4bcs1/what_was_the_typical_student_diet_in_the_171800s/fnwmvnm/?context=999) about student diets at Colonial Colleges:

> This schedule, though, had a whole bunch of caveats based on when we're talking about and who we're talking about. Colleges would raise or lower their admission expectations based on a variety of factors, including their financial situation. When times were flush, a college might include the cost of all food in a student's tuition bill [and make their admission criteria more stringent.] At other times, students would have to pay for their meals, which created a class-based structure where students with limited means had simpler meals than those provided to young men from families of means [and they would accept nearly any boy/man of worthy character who could pay tuition.] Likewise, not all students lived on campus. Many, especially older students, lived in the surrounding community and simply went home for meals. 

This can also help us think about the life of a 13-year-old at Princeton. That is, the nature of his experiences would be linked to the reasons he was there and the network around him. If he was attending because his father was in a position of power in the local community, he likely went home and had the responsibilities of a child in his family. If, however, he was attending alone, far from home, he was likely making decisions for himself and had more responsibility. All of that said, age at that time didn't hold the same weight as it does now. There are records of 10-year-olds enrolled at Harvard in that era and it wasn't necessarily a remarkable thing like we think of a 10-year-old at Harvard today. Basically, the adults around the child thought the thing that made the most sense at that moment was for the boy to attend Harvard, so they went. (More [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/drpr9b/how_common_was_it_before_ww2_for_people_to/f6m2jen/?context=999) on the history of age as it relates to school.)

In terms of what 13-year-olds were studying at the time, a classical education was heavy on Greek, Latin, some math, some sciences, logic, and rhetoric. While there are lots of benefits to learning Greek and Latin from a learning sciences perspective, they weren't learning Greek and Latin in order to communicate in the language. Rather, it was because smart men knew Greek and Latin. And this, in a nutshell, is the largest difference between a 13-year-old at Princeton in the 1700s and a college First Year today; learning things because that's what smart men knew versus learning things that are applicable to a particular future. 

Today's first-year college student is at a specific college because they want to learn specific things that college offers. In effect, they pick a college based on their future plans (or what they can afford, of which college accepted them, etc. But generally speaking.) During their high school experience, they were likely encouraged to pursue topics of interest, to read books that they thought were interesting, and generally encouraged to think about college as a part of finding their place in the world. Their academic achievement can best be defined as ""diverse."" They studied English, Math, Science, History, Music, Art, physical education, a foreign language, etc. (AKA the modern liberal arts curriculum. More [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cx2dct/when_and_what_was_the_cause_of_the_trend_of/eyj7hij/?context=999) on the shift from the classical curriculum to the modern one) The math they studied in HS was different than the math a 13-year-old at Princeton studied, not necessarily less or more complex... just different. 

Which means, practically speaking, if you put a 13-year-old enrolled at Princeton in 1780 up against a 17-year-old enrolled at Princeton today and the questions were about the Bible and Socrates, the 13-year-old would reign supreme. Ask questions about history, literature, or statistics, the modern kid is [likely] going to come out ahead."
"I've heard tell that the initial interactions between the Conquistadors and the Aztecs were friendly, and it was only after the Conquistadors witnessed a mass sacrifice (which they'd been invited to as it was part of a religious festival) that attitudes changed.  Is there any weight to this?"
"To answer your question, I downloaded microdata from the 1% sample of the 1860 and 1870 censuses from IPUMS (a website run by the University of Minnesota). I then dropped everyone who was born outside of the U.S. Since it was a 1% sample, I then multiplied everything by 100 to get an estimate for how many people were in the general population.

In 1860, there were about 230,000 U.S. born residents who were alive in 1787. By 1870, that number is only 68,000.

So what about those who were alive during the signing of the declaration of independence? Those are about 40,000 in 1860 and 7500 in 1870. 

How many people would have remembered the signing of the declaration of independence and the end of the Civil War? Well about 1000 were age 10 during the declaration of independence and lived to see 1870. "
"I should have known this was coming: here are some sources and also some useful texts that provide further context and deeper elaboration:

The Ideology of Kokugo, by Lee Yeounsuk is an excellent analysis of Post-Meiji Japan that mostly draws upon a linguistic angle, but also includes relevant historical background and analysis to reinforce the authors thesis. Yeounsuk discusses the perception of the Samurai in particular to describe how the Japanese empire was able to use and manipulate \*the past\* in order to empower a nation hungry for war.

More generally, however, I would recommend ""Inventing the Way of the Samurai,"" by Oleg Benesch. The entire book was available on JStor a while back, though I'm not sure where it could be accessed now. Much of my information about Kamakura and the Warring States periods comes from there. The text deals with the nationalization of the samurai class as a cultural identifier: though of course it does so by breaking down what the actual roles of Samurai was in differing periods, then synthesizing on how the mythologized version we see today is mostly a fabrication.

Unfortunately, my sources on Edo-Era samurai taking on the roles of philosophers or mathematicians comes mostly from lecture, though ""Sacred Mathematics"" by Fukagawa Hidetoshi and Tony Rothman is a great intro to Sangaku, Japanese geometry pioneered by samurai scholars during the times of peace.

For a leftist critique of Japanese Empire attitudes with regard to tradition and the samurai, I recommend ""Race for Empire"" by Takashi Fujitani. To see the more right-leaning POV, I would recommend ""In Praise of Shadows"" by Jun'Ichiro Tanizaki, a book actually published BEFORE WWII even began in 1933. Neither explore the samurai in any meaningful detail, but both express opinions regarding the historical fetishization of Japanese culture, both from within, and outside of Japan.

I did not use any quotes in my answer, so I hope this is good enough material for now. Let me know if more elaboration would be necessary.

Edit: A word."
Thank you for taking the time. Extremely well done
"So I am not sure that Ciricione was saying that _all_ Presidents from Truman to H.W. Bush were advised this. I suspect he was saying that Presidents have been advised this over various points in time — between Truman and H.W. Bush. 

The big point here is that the ""nuclear taboo"" — the non-use of nuclear weapons after WWII — is a norm and not a ""rule."" It took time to get established. It gets challenged regularly. It didn't have to even happen — if Eisenhower had been President during the early Korean War, perhaps they would have been used? There is a lot of contingency there.

And I just want to note that you say ""knowing the almost certain outcome"" — but the outcomes are not as certain as you may think. E.g., there was no mutual assured destruction during the Korea War (none really with the USSR until the early 1960s; you do have a _deterrence_ structure in the 1950s, but it is not mutually assured, and a lot of it is about the Soviets threatening Europe not the USA) or against non-nuclear powers (e.g. Vietnam). Yes, the USA was not going to nuke the USSR after the 1960s but there are lots of other possible places where nukes could have come into play that do not involve straightforward deterrence theory. And there are also many ways to use nukes — they are not just ""big bombs dropped on cities,"" they can also be ""small weapons used tactically"" by the 1950s. That makes them seem less ""special"" to many military and even some political figures (Eisenhower and Nixon were both of the mind that tactical nukes were basically ""non-special"").

Some well-known and well-documented examples:

* Truman and the Berlin Crisis. Advisors recommended to Truman that he launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the USSR. Truman declined, though he did authorize moving non-nuclear assemblies to the region. 

* Truman and the Korean War. Could have used nukes. Some generals wanted to use nukes. Plenty of popular discussion about the use of nukes. Moved non-nuclear assemblies to the region, but opted not to use nukes. By 1949 Truman was very dubious about the utility of nuclear weapons in military conflicts and also very aware of the fact that he required international support to wage a conflict of this nature.

* Eisenhower and the Taiwan Strait crisis. Threatened to use nukes against China. Lots of talk at top levels of possibility of using nukes. Willingness by Eisenhower to potentially use them. Military advisors recommended them. Ultimately didn't need to use them. (This incident, as an aside, led to China starting their own nuclear program.)

* Ex-President Eisenhower recommended to both Kennedy and Johnson that they use nukes in Laos and Vietnam. Lots of people talked about possibility of using them in Vietnam at different levels. Ultimately neither President was interested.

* There was some discussion about possible use of nukes in the Nixon administration but ultimately a much lesser sort of pressure. Nixon himself was interested in nukes in Vietnam, and stated in 1985 that he considered using nukes four times during his administration (Vietnam, the Yom-Kippur War, the Sino-Soviet border disputes, and the 1971 India-Pakistan War... yeah, don't ask me what he intended to do with them, this is just what he told Time magazine). Much of the Nixon admin papers remains closed so it is hard to know more. What is interesting about Nixon is that he seems to have been the one interested in nukes, whilst his military people had internalized the idea that they were not actually all that useful.

* I don't know of strong pressures from the top on Ford, Carter, or Reagan to use nukes in any of their conflicts. I suspect there were no truly serious ones. By this point the Soviets have true MAD capability, and the Chinese have the capability to do real damage (though not MAD), so any possible use would have to be in smaller conflicts. This does not mean that the world was not ever _close_ to using weapons — we are speaking only on whether presidents were encouraged to use them by top advisors. The ""taboo"" was thoroughly in place at this point — if you were going to use nukes, you'd have to argue why nukes would be more useful in a given situation when they didn't appear to have been useful in previous ones. Again, this does not mean these were anti-nuclear presidents. Reagan did much to accelerate and encourage the nuclear arms race. But he didn't really contemplate striking first. (The Soviets were not always sure of that, though!)

* Lastly, G.H.W. Bush — during the first Gulf War there was explicit talk about the possibility of using them in Iraq. Basically it was implied that if Saddam Hussein set the Kuwaiti oil fields on fire, or used chemical or biological weapons against US troops, we might use nukes in retaliation (in a low-yield, tactical way — not targeting cities). In fact, we now know that Saddam _thought_ we would use nukes if they set the oil fields on fire... and set them on fire anyway. (Which is an interesting example of nuclear deterrence _not_ working, in a sense.) But the reality of these pressures seems to have not been extreme; Bush was not interested in using tactical nukes. 

* Though we are well beyond our remit in terms of the 20-year rule, it might be worth noting that there was much talk of using low-yield ""bunker-busting"" nukes in the GWB administration, and considerable funds applied to the question. Anecdotally I have heard military sorts of people talk about the advantages such a weapon would have in targeting underground facilities like Fordow. Presumably these discussions also took place at higher levels. Cheney, at least in public statements, said they were not interested in using nuclear weapons in such cases.

Anyway — the authoritative source on this topic is Nina Tannewald, _The Nuclear Taboo: The United States and the Non-Use of Nuclear Weapons Since 1945_ (Cambridge University Press, 2007). It discusses all of the above examples mentioned, and several others. "
"> Am I wrong or cynical to wonder how this happened?

If you are, I’m right there with you; which is why I mentioned it explicitly. 

I don’t think I’ve ever read any details directly from the jurors. But we can speculate. In this case the defense formed the “Committee to Defend Martin Luther King and the Struggle for Freedom in the South” and throughout the case kept it very much in the public eye. So the jury was very much aware of what the press was saying about the case. 

And the case itself was ridiculous. Rather than a misdemeanor charge of evading taxes, the state hit him with a felony perjury charge for filing a false document. Apparently it’s the only time in history Alabama has charged a tax misfiling as perjury. King had been fined the supposed underpayment which he promptly paid... twice, as well as paying his bail which meant he had paid the state over three times as much as he supposedly owed them. 

Then during the trial the prosecution introduced over 1,400 pieces of evidence. Then after summing up the evidence the state auditor in court under oath admitted as far as he could tell there was no evidence of fraud. He then also admitted that he had come under political pressure to create the charge. After the star prosecution witness admitted under oath that the charges were trumped up and King was innocent... well that was a bridge too far even for an all white Alabama jury, especially for a prominent national case. As King put it, “Something happened to that jury. It said no matter how much they must suppress me, they must tell the truth.” He fully expected to be convicted and his defense team was preparing for a federal appeal from the beginning. 

Interestingly enough probably the longest reaching effect of the case was that it lead to New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. The commissioner of public affairs Lester Sullivan had sued the Times and King’s defense fund for defamation and won $500,000 in damages in Alabama courts. When the case hit the Supreme Court they squashed it hard 9-0; which more or less ended the Southern strategy of using defamation lawsuits to suppress reporting on civil rights stories. If Alabama hadn’t tried to maliciously prosecute King, we might have very different press freedom laws today."
"The people who sacrificed at the altar of Zeus were likely citizens of the nearby cities (Dion and Pythion); it was never the site of an important sanctuary. 

Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing whether the people who sacrificed on Olympus thought they were approaching the true home of the gods. The fact that an altar was set up on this remote mountain ridge in the first place suggests that it was regarded as a sacred place. More than that we really cannot say."
"Did the Greeks, being Greek Orthodox Christians find it similarly distasteful the obsession with its pre-Christian religion as the people of Iran?"
"As outlined in Geoffrey Robertson's book *An Inconvenient Genocide*, the core belief behind the Turkish denial of the Armenian Genocide lies in the *motives* for the killings. Turkish Officials don't deny that Ottoman military personnel killed Armenians; they dispute the amount (they claim 300 000, while the most commonly referred to number is 1.5 million) and the reasoning behind it.

Robertson cites the Turkish ""official"" numbers of Armenians living in Turkey at the time as a reason that 1.5 million Armenians couldn't have been killed: ""[Turkish] demographic studies prove that prior to World War I, fewer than 1.5 million Armenians lived in the entire Ottoman Empire. Thus, allegations that more than 1.5 million Armenians from eastern Anatolia died must be false.""

(It's noteworthy that Robertson counters this with evidence from the Armenian Church, who claim that 2.1 million Armenians were living in Anatolia at that time.)

On the intention, Article II of the United Nations *Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Genocide* outlines that, in order for a sanctioned killing to be classified as a genocide, there must be ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group..."". Turkish officials today claim that the killings were performed because Armenians ""rose up"" against the Ottoman government in support of Russia, hoping that in victory they would claim their independence. To support this, in 2007 Turkish counsellor Orhan Tung wrote in the New Statesman (an opinion that the government mirrors to this day) that ""credible evidence"" for the intention to commit genocide has never been concretely found. This is obviously disputed, because as opposed to the Holocaust or the Bosnian War, there are no reported documents that are widely internationally recognized as showing intent for genocide.

(Again, its worth noting that Armenian historian Ara Sarafian reported to Mediamax that *Talaat Pasha's Report on the Armenian Genocide*, which was published by the Gomidas Institute in April 2011, as a proper Ottoman government document showcasing this exact intent.)

tl;dr: The Turkish government doesn't belief that an Armenian *genocide* happened, but refer to it as politically motivated killings, because of the definition of ""genocide"" by the United Nations.

"Yeah, for every thread that is full of deleted comments there's one like this with referenced accounts of acne in WW2."
"Thank you for your detailed answer!

Did any journalists like Buckley or the *Tribune* change their stance as more evidence came out?  I'm noticing that Buckley's editorial was written before it was known that Nixon even had a hidden taping system, let alone the contents of the tapes."
Its funny seeing the various moral panics of the past. Did early science fiction see any sort of backlash like that? You mentioned the pulps which I know science fiction had a very close relationship with but were there any hurdles unique to sci fi?
"There are a few things that changed there, but perhaps the biggest is the continuing collapse of the Soviet Union, and the diplomatic shifts that it wrought.

1975 was, perhaps, a peak in the Arab world's economic and political clout. The Soviet Union was a strong ally to much of the Arab world, despite some fraying starting to show. Egypt and Syria had bloodied Israel in the 1973 war, albeit being in a fairly bad position militarily at the end of the war. The oil embargo put in place by OPEC had demonstrated a serious ability to place economic pressures on the United States and the West.

The interests of the Arab world should already be clear with respect to Zionism and Israel. The Arab world was still adhering, at least publicly, to the position that Israel's existence would never be accepted, in line with the 1967 ""three no's"" at Khartoum (no peace with Israel, no negotiations with Israel, no recognition of Israel). That alone, in 1975, meant that at least 10 states were already pushing strongly for the resolution as a way to delegitimize Israel (Algeria, Bahrain, South Yemen, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen).

When you consider this, as well as the clout of the Soviet Union, it makes sense that the resolution was able to pass. The opposition of the West and parts of Asia was insufficient to stand against this type of concerted diplomatic effort. In fact, some have posited (like Gil Troy in ""When Oom Became Shmoom"", referring to an Israeli saying that became popular especially after this resolution, ""Oom Shmoom"", meaning essentially ""the UN? Whatever, who cares"") that the resolution was voted in by a *smaller* majority than expected, which may in part be due to the US stance and the fact that the very resolution impliedly violated the UN Charter's goal of respecting self-determination and seeking peace. As George H.W. Bush put it in 1991 when endorsing the repeal of the resolution, rejecting Zionism is to reject Israel's very existence, despite its status as a member in good standing at the UN. Challenging Israel's right to exist would be contrary, impliedly also, to the goal of seeking peace.

The Soviet Union's anti-Israel position, motivated in part by its alliance with the Arab states and in part by antisemitism, is well-documented. However, not a lot of folks are aware that the Soviets did their best to export antisemitism to other countries as well, especially out of the belief that Zionism was part of a global conspiracy heralded by capitalism.

The KGB and satellite spy agencies were deeply involved in this exporting of antisemitism to the developing world, including even to the Arab world. This is not to say that antisemitism began with the Soviets there; it had already been spreading by the 1800s in classical form. But I think there’s room to argue that Soviet exports of antisemitism strengthened and played off the fears of antisemitism that already existed in the Arab world and elsewhere for political gain. The campaign took on new fervor following the Israeli victory over Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in 1967, which embarrassed the Soviets who had supplied the Arab states with much of their weaponry.

The Soviet campaign was not just to paint Zionism as Jewish self-determination or Israel's existence and racist as a result. It wasn't just to oppose ""nationalism"" and thereby oppose Zionism as well. Instead, the Soviets painted Zionism as a ""world threat"". As Howard Sachar put it in *A History of the Jews in the Modern World*, the reason the Arab states lost was because of an ""all-powerful international force"" that was composed of ""Jewish communities everywhere"", not just Israel. The Kremlin now spoke of ""the power of world Jewry"", and ""Zionists"" were portrayed as ""rich Jewish bourgeoisie"", contrasted with the good Soviet communist. Zionism was seen as synonymous with global capitalism and excess, and the Soviets exported this ideology fervently, claiming that the United States was just a puppet of the Zionists, and telling the Muslim world that Israel and the US would try to turn the Muslim world into a Jewish territory.

This diplomatic onslaught slowly weakened as the Soviet Union did, and as Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979. The United States, which had fought against the resolution as racist from the moment it was proposed, experienced a resurgence in influence at the United Nations with the fall of the Soviet Union.

But the resolution was set up for repeal *before* the Soviet Union formally dissolved. In fact, the Soviets *supported* the revocation in 1991. It was a mere 10 days before the dissolution actually took place. This was a byproduct of the Soviet collapse, and reversal of many policy positions. As I said at the start, not many realize exactly how ingrained the Soviet Union was in the process of anti-Israel positions in international bodies throughout its existence. For a state that had ostensibly made antisemitism a crime, many of its policies were motivated by, or at least spread through, an industrial campaign of antisemitism spread that replaced the word ""Jewish"" with ""Zionist"". And so, as Soviet influence waned, so did the ability of this campaign to bear fruit. The effects of Soviet propaganda about Zionism would continue to bear fruit worldwide, but the resolution's revocation came at an opportune moment when the diplomatic stars aligned. Portrayals of Zionism as an ""international force"", and as a racist endeavor, would not end with the Soviet Union's collapse, however; they would only be delayed."

I'm trying to say that ""The Jews"" involves a whole host of stereotypes that don't even *relate to* actual Jewish people, but the burden/smear of the stereotype falls on them anyway.

And--I don't know how to word this right, but--when people talk about Jewish conspiracies and stuff, like in AskHistorians questions, they don't usually say ""Jews"" the way we'd say ""Jews and Christians"" as kind of a generic thing. It's always ""The Jews,"" like there is a completely overlapping Venn diagram between ""people involved in this conspiracy"" and ""people who are Jewish.""

Like saying ""Christians are responsible for the Holocaust"" versus ""The Christians are responsible for the Holocaust."" When applied to Jews, that distinction makes me very uncomfortable.

Follow up question: I’ve heard Schliemann (the archeologist who ‘discovered’ Troy and the tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae) has been shown to have faked some of his finds. Is this true and if so how have the finds that weren’t discredited been confirmed as authentic?

When the above poster quotes the New York Tribune as praising his ""republican"" way of life, this is one of the things they meant: ""republican"" partly in the Roman sense of being an accountable servant of the laws and the state, as opposed to acting tyrannically."

This is one of the best replies from 'an actual historian' I've ever seen on this sub.
"I feel more comfortable writing about history or archaeology rather than language, but this has been an academic interest of mine for some time. I can at least partially answer your question. To state it shortly: Dutch speaking communities survived in New York and New Jersey for quite some time after the British Conquest and American Revolution, at least until the 1830s.

Understand that the Dutch very quickly became a minority in Anglo New York. The Dutch population of New Netherland was never large, with around 2500 people in New Amsterdam and 1000 in Beverwijk (Modern New York and Albany respectively) in 1664. Plus there were a scattering of smaller towns and patroonships (a sort of feudal estate) between the two and in modern New Jersey. Of that small population, much of the population was not actually Dutch, instead being made up of other Europeans who spoke other languages, significant Native communites, and the enslaved/freed slaves.

That being said, there are records that show the Dutch language did survive for quite some time in parts of the region. In more rural areas, the Dutch quickly gained a reputation for conservatism and cultural retention that was tied to the Dutch Reformed Church. As social life, especially in rural areas, revolved closely with the church, Dutch families remained close. Often they intermarried in their own small enclaves consisting of other Dutch families. More than just their language persisted, with much of their own material cultural and customs retaining noticeable Dutch characteristics to outside observers.

To bring the topic back to language, the Dutch Reformed Church eventually began to receive pressure to have sermons in English. This pressure came from younger Dutch descendants and less so the Anglo administrations. By the early 1700s, especially in New York City, younger Dutch began to speak more English and wanted their church sermons to reflect this new reality. The area's rising English population had gradually made English the more practical language for politics, business and public life. In private, many of these Dutch descendants still spoke Dutch, but English became more of the language that needed to be spoken to get ahead. The end result was that many New York Dutch became Anglicized, especially the upper classes. In rural areas though the Dutch language still persisted such as in Tappan, New York,  with the last completely Dutch service being held there in 1835.

It is rather difficult to place an exact date on the end of the Dutch language in New York. Some of it still persists today. There are many words and phrases that are unique to the area that have their origins in Dutch. For example, many of the rivers and creeks that run through the countryside are referred to as ""kils"" which is Dutch for river. But you wont find anyone speaking fluent Dutch as a first language.

I have also found mention of other Dutch holdouts that survived even longer, so much so that that they began to morph into dialects very different from Holland Dutch. Unfortunately there is frustratingly little academic writings about them. Jersey Dutch is the best known of these (but I also read of Mohawk and Albany Dutch). According to one account, a traveler reported that hundreds still spoke Jersey Dutch around the Schraalenburgh Reformed Church in Dumont New Jersey in 1899.

So as a sizeable minority language, it probably lasted until the early to mid 1800s. In certain areas like rural New Jersey it lasted to at least the late 1800s. Long before that however, most Dutch speakers likely adopted English as a public language in order to survive in an Anglo dominated society.

I hope this is up to your standards mods, but if you want me to edit this at all or give better citations I am all for it. I sorta took this from an old butchered paper I wrote a year ago. I also realize this didn't quite answer your second question, but its a start.

"There was a prominent 'yes' campaign in the 1967 referendum, run by the organisation Federal Council for the Advancement Of Aboriginals And Torres Strait Islanders, which had posters, advertisements in papers, and even advertising jingles on radio ([there are some examples of editorials and ads here](http://indigenousrights.net.au/civil_rights/the_referendum,_1957-67/campaigning_for_a_yes_vote)). In contrast, there was *no* significant 'no' campaign in the 1967 referendum - which made it unique amongst Australian referenda. 

In parliament, all of the major parties supported a 'yes' vote, and so there was no published 'case' for a 'no' vote in the parliamentary record. And this was the point, in a way: the referendum to amend the references to indigenous people in the constitution was a surefire thing that the huge majority of people had agreed on by 1967 (successful referendums being necessary to change the Australian constitution). The government of the time hoped to get up another, more controversial, amendment to the constitution relating to Federal vs state powers, and were hoping that that amendment would piggyback its way to success on the more popular one. 

It should be said that there's some controversy over the meaning of the constitutional amendment to omit the mentions of indigenous peoples in the constitutions; it's more complicated than 'recognising Aboriginals as Australian citizens'. Attwood and Markus in 1998 argued that its implications for the legal rights and status of indigenous peoples in Australia were slight, as in most states Aborigines had already had the rights of citizens, such as the right to vote (apart from, sort of, in Western Australia and Queensland). Attwood and Markus argue that the change was largely symbolic for this reason. Elsewhere, Taffe in 2007 argued that the real change that resulted from the constitutional amendment was that Aboriginal affairs was no longer a state but rather a Federal responsibility. Where, previously, Federal governments had argued that indigenous people were the responsibility of the states, they no longer had this particular excuse; as a result, for example, the Whitlam government set up a department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1972. 

There are a few reasons why the 'yes' vote was popular, especially amongst the majority of the Australian population that lived in cities. By 1967, the advent of television in the 1950s had opened many eyes to how difficult conditions were for indigenous peoples. Additionally, the Australian public was aware of international opprobrium about the Apartheid of South Africa, and did not want to become an international pariah, and the referendum seemed a clear way to demonstrate that. And in the 1960s there was a new-found prominence for indigenous rights activists, such as organisations like FCAATSI. And as the change was in many ways symbolic, there were few real grounds for opposition to it, as nobody particularly felt they would lose out (which perhaps might have been different if the consitutional amendments clearly implied the land rights which came about after the Mabo decision in the 1990s, for example).

In general, advocacy for the 'no' vote was largely seen in public in letters to the editor, and was often quite racist; one letter to the editor of the *Adelaide Advertiser* claimed the vote would propel indigenous people ""into the turmoil of a civilization they probably do not understand and do not want"". More genteel arguments against the amendment revolved around arguments for states' rights, which would be undermined by the change to the constitution. However, even this was quite muted; the Premier of Queensland, Frank Nicklin, appears to have had assurances by Harold Holt that they would continue working with the states on Aboriginal Affairs. There's also some suggestion that state Premiers were happy to handball responsibility for a difficult portfolio - that they probably did not understand and did not want - to the Federal government.

The highest 'no' vote was in Western Australia, where there was a 20% no vote. Western Australia of course had a successful referendum to secede from Australia in 1933 (which was ignored by the Federal parliament), which is emblematic of Western Australians having less trust in the distant, Eastern-based Federal Government than the rest of Australia. There were also higher 'no' votes in country areas - the highest being in Kalgoorlie in country Western Australia, which almost hit 30% (and which still has some significant and highly publicised tensions between the indigenous and white parts of its community).

"Hi there! I'm most familiar with peasant political organization as it existed in middle Germany (The Holy Roman Empire) from the twelfth century through the end of the so-called Peasants' War of 1525 which was the largest social revolt in European history until the French Revolution. The following comment is therefore strictly limited to this context as the forms of peasant organization into larger polities could take a number of different forms depending on the setting. In fact, these differences in organization could affect how commune-like a settlement or region of settlements could be.

&#x200B;

That said, David Sabean's *Power in the Blood* is one of the clearest insights that we have into the nature of peasant village organization and peasant social relations. Sabean took a look at clerical documents from the area around Würtemberg from 1580-1800 to reconstruct how peasants interacted with each other and with outsiders. Because the typical peasant was illiterate, these clerical documents often written by non-natives to their parishes are the best sources we have to go on. One of these records, for instance, shows how peasants dealt with grudges between members of the village. One villager refused to go to Sunday mass because another villager in attendance had wronged him and the grievance had yet to be made up for. In attempting to convince the first villager to go back to church, the cleric in charge of the parish tried to threaten him with excommunication, yet he did not budge. This villager made it clear that he physically could not bring himself to be in the presence of the other villager until their mutual beef had been adequately made up for, his desire for atonement even going beyond his desire to fulfill his religious obligations. From this vignette, Sabean concluded that late medieval peasants very much valued their reputations and the appearance of ""face"", though once the metaphorical hatchet was buried, relations between the two parties could go back to normal as if nothing happened.

In the same book, Sabean suggests that German peasant life was very insular and highly distrustful of strangers, whatever their claims to authority were. Indeed local holy men were often preferred to specially trained priests in matters of religion because the local holy men often spoke to issues that mattered in the communities whereas the priests were often from out of town, behaved improperly (i.e. drinking, gambling, fighting, keeping mistresses, etc.), and behaved as if they were above the very communal minded villages they preached to.  For a clear example of this, Hans Böhm was a holy man who stirred up armed resistance against perceived clerical and noble injustices in late fifteenth-century Franconia.

&#x200B;

In looking at why this is, it is important to remember that these communities were largely self-sufficient in terms of food and other basic necessities but often engaged in short-range specialized trade with other villages, market towns, and cities to acquire whatever they could not make themselves or make in adequate supply. Often villagers would never leave more than a few miles beyond their village borders and so their neighbors were often people they had known for their entire lives and they were stuck together for better or worse. If your barn was knocked over in a storm, your neighbors were often the only people on hand to help you rebuild. Sabean suggests that this sort of sustained close contact bred the communal mindset that reached much further back into German history. 

&#x200B;

That said, just how communal medieval/ early modern peasant life  was and what the communal mindset really meant has been a matter of debate for the better part of a century. Indeed, some East German medievalists would suggest that Marxism had roots in peasant organization and so in their minds, a *Das Kapital* quoting peasant wouldn't be far from reality. Jokes aside, few credible historians would posit that relations between peasants and their overlords (clerical or noble) were peaceful and amicable. The current consensus is that peasants were often in a constant state of negotiation with their overlords about the exact nature and amount of dues that they owed their landlords and the peasants had a variety of tools in their toolbelts in order to help ensure that they weren't simply trampled by the desires of their overlords. One popular method was a rent strike in which villagers would all agree to withhold payment of their dues in cash or kind to their landlords as a means of renegotiating these dues. Other means included sending petitions, and holding debates in meeting spaces. Armed uprisings against landlords were often a weapon of last resort when landlords and subjects were at an impasse and conditions no longer lent themselves to the peaceful renegotiation of dues. 

These uprisings could force the hand of their landlords into granting concessions to the peasants if their forces were either too small in number, too dispersed, or mercenaries were too expensive. However, peasants could also be obliterated by their landlords (or their benefactors) . During the Peasants' War, the Swabian League of North German principalities systematically cut through swaths of uprising peasants leaving tens if not hundreds of thousands dead. The exact causes of the peasants' war are still a matter of debate, but it seems fair to characterize it less as a coordinated movement of interconnected villages defined by a common political agenda. Rather the Peasants' War and other uprisings of its type should be better understood as a wave of semi-independent uprisings against their overlords based largely on local grievances.

As a follow up question; did Rome have building codes like we have today?
"I definitely don't remember all of it bc it was many years ago. Some of it was really blatant, like saying that slaves were ""treated like family"" (that's a real quote) and that it was a purely economic thing and necessary and not actually a problem. Or things like Rosa Parks just ""was tired from a long day at work"" and that's why she refused to give up her seat (not true but also a commonly shared myth, in reality she was a well-trained activist executing a well thought out plan and she also wasn't the first to try it) but then no mention of the bus boycott at all. There was also a lot of painting Native Americans as aggressors, like they were deliberately waging war for no reason other than bc they were ""savages"" who just only knew how to do war (rather than as people defending their homes from actual invaders) with the colonists as completely innocent victims who did nothing to provoke these uncalled for attacks. There was also this sort of general idea that as soon as the Civil Rights Acts and Voting Rights Act were passed everything was just great for Black people in the US and there were never any problems ever again and racism is definitely not real in modern society. Some of it was just leaving things out like only publishing the Dream speech from Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. but leaving out everything about his actual activism and just leaving it at the Civil Rights Act was passed and nothing else or Helen Keller only existing as the Miracle Worker narrative and ignoring her after she grew up or leaving out that the Suffragettes were only interested in votes for white women not all women or how the reservation system and Native sovereignty even works. And of course the old standard that the Civil War was just about ""states' rights"" and nothing else and that actually the put upon Sotherners were just trying to protect themselves and their livelihoods and they had ""no choice.""

The kind of stuff you'd expect really, I can't think of anything off the top of my head that was more notable but now I really wish I'd kept track and written things down!"
"As a general rule, Latins had property and marriage rights, and possibly the right to migrate to Rome to gain Roman citizenship (a quote from Livy suggests this), but not to vote in the Roman elections for the magistrates that would, in turn, exercise considerable power over Roman subjects including Latin citizens. I have given a fuller answer to another poster who asked more or less the same question."
"Books I'm referencing here are *1491: The Americas Before Columbus* by Charles C Mann, and *The Last Days of the Incas* by Kim MacQuarrie.

The latter goes into more detail of how the Inca Empire functioned as it operates as a chronicle of the Spanish Conquest of what would later be known as Peru by Francisco Pizarro. In essence, the Inca Empire didn't have a large amount of free, internal trade as we would understand it in European cultures.

In the Inca society, all lands belonged to the Inca and were used with his permission. The structure was fairly typical of feudalism, with a strongly defined hierarchy from the Inca down through increasingly regional Chiefs, to the populace.

The Inca tithe system operated purely on labour. A typical household would have a quota of three months per year in labour for the state. This was considered to be service directly to the Inca, and is also where tribute comes from.

This work might have been to fabricate Vicunya garments for the Inca, it may have been for building roads or bridges, serving in the military, or making weapons. The tribute would be distributed to local warehouses, where it would then be distributed to where it needed to be. It might be that llama wool was woven into nets in one area, to be eventually moved across to a coastal city for use in fishing. The fabricator typically wouldn't leave their home further than the local warehouse to deposit these goods. (Unless they were called to serve somewhere specifically, like a construction project or military campaign.)

This system was incredibly efficient. Numerous Conquistador accounts note warehouses piled high with goods, as the Empire tended to overproduce materials under this system. It also gave incredible resilience to food supplies, allowing a 2000 mile long empire of ten million people to operate for 90 years apparently without a single major famine.

Communication was also quite sophisticated. Runners called Chaski would operate in relay. Apparently this allowed a message from Cajamarca to reach Cusco, a distance of 1100 miles over mountainous terrain, in only five days. Atahualpa was able to operate his empire in captivity entirely through these runners, organising literal tonnes of gold and silver to be delivered across to Cajamarca within the span of months. It was also difficult to intercept the messages, as there was no writing. One would have to capture the Chaski himself and get the message from them. Serving as a Chaski was also a labour tithe option.

This also means, however, that the message dies with the Chaski. The Spanish used this to terrifying effect as their horses could cover ground far faster, and thus Chaski struggled to get the message out about the initial invasion. The fact that the Inca was the nexus of all these communications was also a key weak point. The capture of Atahualpa at Cajamarca by Pizarro completely stalled the empire until he was able to negotiate resuming his duties, in exchange for gathering gold and silver for the Conquistadors."
"I have a somewhat related question based on a misconception I often see during discussions on this subject, including in OP’s question. Discussions about this phenomenon often talk about how 17,000,000 people are descended directly from Genghis Khan, whereas the [original paper](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(07)60587-4) (Zerjal et al. 2003) explicitly makes the prediction that the Y chromosome lineage arose several generations before Genghis, and was shared by his male-line relatives (i.e. any brothers, sons of his father’s brothers, etc.). 

Given that, how many of those descendants are likely to be of Genghis himself vs. his male-line relatives? Biologically it seems likely that it would be a smaller proportion, but I don’t know what other social factors might have played into that, or how many male-line relatives might have been around at the time. "
"Amazing answer, thank you for taking the time to reply."
Thankyou for taking the time to write this.
"First off, I'm not sure if your exact premise based on sitcoms quite pans out. There *is* some noticeable change in family dynamics in sitcoms starting in 1970 and going through 1990, but it's not as simple as mutual spousal animosity. I trudged through
a number of lists and came up with prominent 80s sitcoms with married
couples:

The Cosby Show (84-92)

Family Ties (82-89)

Diff'rent Strokes (78-86)

Webster (83-89)

ALF (86-90)

Small Wonder (85-89)

Out of This World (87-91)

None of these seem to be premised around parents that loathe each other.
Two of them involve aliens (ALF and Out of This World) and one
involves a robot (Small Wonder).

Maybe you're thinking of Married... with Children, which
ran from 1987 to 1997, so perhaps counts as 80s? Or The
Simpsons which started in 1989 so *just touched* the 80s, but
I don't think anyone would describe as a 1980s show? (We'll get back to both of those.) Or if you're shooting for deep
cuts, Unhappily Ever After, which Ron Leavitt (who co-created Married...
with Children) worked on, but that's not way out until 1995 to 1999? Or Family Guy, which started in 1999, so starting a year before Malcolm and the Middle?

If you're going back in time, maybe you mean All in the Family (1971-1979),
featuring bigoted father Archie Bunker. In one of the most famous episodes, Edith's Problem, Edith goes through menopause.

>Mike Stivic [son-in-law of Archie]: What did the doctor say?

>Archie Bunker: He just said that menopause is a pretty tough time to be going through; especially for nervous types.

>Mike Stivic: So?

>Archie Bunker: So he prescribed these here pills.

>Mike Stivic: Oh, good.

>Archie Bunker: I gotta take three of 'em a day.

Archie is certainly insensitive (and can't handle Edith's problem interfering with a trip to Florida) but it still doesn't quite match the ""boomers hate their wife"" thing you're going for. (And menopause in 1972 would likely indicate someone from the ""Greatest Generation"" -- boomers are two generations away.) While All in the Family's massive success (Archie was called ""the most expensive racist on television"") led to something of a television revolution, it was more in the framing of complex themes (like *Maude*, an *All in the Family* spinoff) as opposed to simply including more aggressive characters.

So, let's reformulate the question to something that might give a satisfying answer:

**Did the family dynamics depicted in sitcoms deteriorate between 1950 and 1990, and does this reflect what happened to US culture at large?**

This ends up hitting close to what I think the original question meant, and there's a fair amount of literature about it. Of course, one argument is what ""deteriorate"" means. On the more ""conservative"" end, Popenoe wrote in length during the 1990s about how

>Recent family decline is more serious than any decline in the past because what is breaking up is the nuclear family . . .

and traced this same decline across various sitcoms. Other media theorists in the ""deteriorate"" camp are Buck, Fields, and Hoffman. However, some from the 1990s simply argued that there was a simple change in family structure and diversity, like Cantor and Moore.

The ""diversity"" part certainly is true -- while the 1950s families were nearly all ""intact"" (the ""nuclear"" form Popenoe wanted) that's not the case by the late 80s; here's a list of ""intact"" vs. ""non-intact"" vs. ""mixed"" families for television shows shown the week of March 9-15 in 1987:

**Intact**: Cosby Show, Family Ties, Growing Pains, 227, Newhart, Webster, Jack & Mike

**Nonintact**: Who's the Boss, Kate & Allie, Carvanaughs, My Sister Sam, Sidekicks, Nothing Easy, Rags to Riches, Our House, Starman

**Mixed**: Dallas, Dynasty, Falcon Crest, Knot's Landing, Colby's

(Incidentally, The first time a divorced woman was on television was 1962 -- *The Lucy Show*, with Lucy Carmichael -- a widow -- sharing a house with Vivian Bagley, a divorced mother. Lucy Carmichael was played by Lucielle Ball of *I Love Lucy* and Vivian Bagley was played by Vivian Vance, who was Ethel Mertz on *I Love Lucy*. This doesn't mean every single family was ""nuclear""; the show *Bachelor Father*, with a premise right in the title, ran from 1957-1962.)

What the question is really asking about, though, is negative interaction between spouses. To make the question easier I'll consider family interactions in general. A mammoth 1980 study analyzed three seasons of television (75-76, 76-77, 77-78) and counted interactions that

""go against"" (attack, oppose, ignore)

""go away"" (evade, withdraw)

""go toward"" (offer information, seek information, contribute, support, show concern, petition, direct, accept support, accept direction)

The first two categories (essentially, what I'll call the ""negative"" ones) had 13% to 16% of interactions, while the remainder fell into the ""go toward"" category, the majority being in ""offers information"" (35% to 37%).

A 1992 study used the exact same categories, with the 1989-1990 season. This time things were broken down by show; the negative percentages again:

>Cosby Show: 16%

>Full House: 10%

>Growing Pains: 33%

>Married with Children: 37%

>Simpsons: 20.7%

Note that the fairly ""traditional"" shows were in line with the mid-1970s, but Growing Pains and Married with Children raise the conflict significantly. However, this can simply indicate more drama and variation. Notably, the sitcoms still followed the ""everything resolves"" model -- as Cantor concludes in a paper:

>If we watch the news, the game shows, and adventure programs on television, we know there
is a greedy, hostile, violent world out there. But the domestic dramas present a different message. Here
human virtues prevail. While we may not be able to have an impact on political or economic conditions,
in the family, through love and sensitivity solutions of conflicts are still possible, and the world is
still manageable."
"I'd actually like to follow up on my response to that follow up question, because I don't want to give the impression that the Ukrainian National Revival was somehow *only* based in Galicia or Right-Bank Ukraine. Quite a few figures were from the area around Kyiv (to its south and east), like Ivan Kotliarevsky (considered the first modern Ukrainian writer), Oleksii Pavlovsky (the author of the first Ukrainian grammar), and Mykola Tsertselev (who published the first collection of Ukrainian folk songs). This region (which was the historic Zaporizhian Cossack Host/Hetmanate) was also relatively unique in that the landowners and elites tended to speak the same language as the peasants, unlike areas to the east and south that were Russified, and areas to the west that had Polish gentry. Kyiv itself had a university that ended up being a hotbed for Ukrainian intellectual activity, including employing the national poet Taras Shevchenko as a drawing instructor (where he got involved in conspiratorial politics). Kharkiv, further east, likewise had a prominent university that was also considered the birthplace of Ukrainian romanticism, and which also published cultural, literary and historic texts on Ukraine and/or in Ukrainian."
WOW this is an incredibly detailed write up and goes deeper than I ever expected.
"This is a really interesting answer, but I feel there still room to get deeply into the ""why"" that OP is asking about. u/Muskwatch names a number of factors like difficult to pronounce sounds, names that share constructors with other words in the language, a multiplicity of languages in the trading milieu - all these factors, as OP pointed out, could be true for almost any other culture and language around the world that English speakers have encountered. I'm still not clear *why* the indigenous peoples of North America were an exception. It seems one part of the answer, which u/Muskwatch answers, has to do with the respect (?) or at least dignity accorded to the earlier people's encountered, who were referred to by their original names (Powhatan, Pocahontas), contrasted with attitudes that accompanied American expansion and eradication? Also, u/Muskwatch refers to a certain playfulness of trappers and traders using different languagess and pidgins - I'd like to know more about that and how it was related. 

If anyone has more insights building off these two answers, I'd be really interested!"
"To give a quick example, one of the original Black Hebrew Israelite groups moved to Liberia in 1966, followed by Israel in 1969. There was no thought of stopping in Ethiopia, and no knowledge of the Ethiopians who were also moving to Israel at that time. In their literature, they considered the Ethiopians just one group of ""black"" people. In Israel, the two groups have basically not interacted. I have to conclude from this that Ethiopian Jews were simply not well known when the beliefs first arose, although with the atomization of these kind of myths on the Internet, I wouldn't be surprised if they have worked their way into some retellings of the mythology."
"Excellent answer! Another important point to emphasize here is that the expansion of the Mongol Empire coincided with the flourishing of the world's first print cultures in the southern Song dynasty, Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty, Korea, and so on. I've already discussed the [history of Chinese print culture and woodblock printing](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7v72u6/in_school_i_was_told_gutenberg_invented_printing/dtqiffv/) in a reply earlier this week, but the gist is that the invention of block printing (and to a lesser extent movable type) created a fertile environment for the expansion of commercial publishing and high levels of literary production in East Asia. Thus in terms of sheer *quantity*, the rise of the Mongols is perhaps better documented than any preceding era in Inner Asian history. 

This is even true after the Mongol conquest of the Southern Song and the establishment of the Yuan dynasty. Khubilai Khan and his successors sponsored the printing and circulation of books. In  ""*Mashaben*: Commercial Publishing in Jianyang from the Song
to the Ming"", Lucille Chia has shown that the literary output by commercial publishers in Jianyang and Fujian did not decline significantly under Mongol rule; it wasn't until the tumultuous transition between the Yuan and Ming that the production of books gradually decreased. 

While there is a mountain of Chinese literary sources documenting the expansion of the Mongols and Mongol rule in China, very little of this has been translated into English or any Western language. Not even the *Yuan Shi* has received a full translation, despite being the official history of the Yuan dynasty compiled during the Ming and among the most important Chinese sources on the history of the Mongols. This is mainly because, as /u/sunagainstgold has discussed, there are very few Western historians working on Asian history, much less the history of Inner Asia. Consider this study from the [American Historical Association](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2015/the-rise-and-decline-of-history-specializations-over-the-past-40-years). In terms of geographic field specializations, 41.2% of listed faculty specialized in American history and 32.2% specialized in European history, whereas 9.4% specialized in Asian history, 7.4% specialized in Latin American history, and around 5% specialized in African history or Middle Eastern history. Thus English-speaking Inner Asian specialists are a minority of a minority."

"The basis for this change itself is in a historical precedent that reaching back to even the Prophet's time.

Recorded in *Sahih Bukhari,* which is held as the most authentic collection of Prophetic Traditions in Islam for over a millennia, we have 2 separate instances of a *Mu'adhdin* (The one who gives the call to prayer) soon after the passing of The Prophet each of which call back to this being an accepted practice by the Prophet in times of extreme need, though each of those instances themselves were in relation to extreme weather.

**Translated** from *Sahih Bukhari,* Book of *Adhan*

*Volume 1, Book 11, Number 590:*

>Narrated 'Abdullah bin Al-Harith:Once on a rainy muddy day, Ibn 'Abbas delivered a sermon in our presence and when the Mu'adhdhin pronounced the Adhan and said, ""Haiya ala-s-sala(t) (come for the prayer)"" Ibn 'Abbas ordered him to say  'Pray at your homes.' The people began to look at each other (surprisingly). Ibn 'Abbas said. ""It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet or his Mu'adhdhin), and it is a license.'

*Volume 1, Book 11, Number 605:*

>Narrated Nafi:Once in a cold night, Ibn 'Umar pronounced the Adhan for the prayer at ,Dajnan (the name of a mountain) and then said, ""Pray at your homes"",  and informed us that Allah's Apostle used to tell the Mu'adhdin to pronounce Adhan and say, ""Pray at your homes"" at the end of the Adhan on a rainy or a very cold night during the journey.""

Any report collected in Sahih Bukhari hardly needed additional verification due to how stringent the conditions were to even be included in the collection in the first place, but these reporters and the people they were reporting on  were all considered Scholars of that first Generation, with 'Ibn Umar being most well known for going to great lengths that were unmatched by any other from that generation or since, to live by the Prophetic Traditions.

For a report to be included in *Sahih Bukhari* it had to be proven that the saying or reported action of the Prophet met with certain criteria such as there being an unbroken and known chain of narrators reaching back to that First Generation of Islam, that all narrators in that chain could have feasibly met with the one they were reporting from, that all of them had  good reputations within their communities, that none of them were known to have weak memories, etc. The list of conditions is long and each report had to fulfill each and every condition to be included. There are other collections of authentic reports with less stringent conditions, but there is little debate regarding the contents of this collection.

This and a few commands from the Quran make the basis for the decision itself. Unfortunately I can not now call upon other instances where specifically the *Adhan* was changed in the years of the various Islamic Empires after the time of the *Khulufa ur-Rashidoon* (The first four Caliphs) as my study generally focused on *Fiqh* (Rulings about general life in Islam) and their Basis in Prophetic Tradition, my knowledge of historical events past that time period is still unfortunately limited to general overviews.

The change to command the people to pray at home is either given at the end of the call or in place of the command to come to prayer. The latter is what you hear in the somewhat viral video of the call to prayer in Kuwait as after announcing to the people to stay at home they close out with the last part of the call *(Allahu Akbar/Allahu Akbar    La ilaha illa Allah)*.

If you are interested in other affects of Covid-19 on Muslim Rituals, The *Jummah Prayer* (Congregational Friday Prayer) has been cancelled indefinitely in many places worldwide (The decision for this has its own basis in Islamic Tradition). There is also uncertainty regarding whether or not the annual *Hajj* Pilgrimage will be canceled or not this year. It would occur right at the end of July this year if it goes on as planned. If it is cancelled it will be added to the nearly 40 entries long list of instances in the last 1400+ years where it has been cancelled. Currently the Saudi Government has only asked the Muslim world to not make any plans yet for it, but have not outright cancelled it just yet."

"It'd be really hard to be more wrong. Every statement here but one ('It's a collection of books') is outright false.

> Now, in many ways, the first book was the Bible.

The speaker seems very unclear about what they think 'book' means, but no definition could justify this. 'Books' in the sense of a single coherent and substantial piece of writing go back at least to the early 2nd millennium BCE. By contrast, the earliest parts of the Hebrew Bible date to around the 7th century BCE (somewhat earlier for isolated passages), and parts are as late as the 100s BCE; the Christian New Testament is 1st-2nd century CE.

> I mean, literally. Because, at one point, there was only one book.

It's hard to imagine what scenario the speaker could be thinking of here. There are thousands of older books.

> Like, as far as our Western culture is concerned, there was one book.

This has never been remotely true. The individual texts in the Hebrew Bible were composed over a period of, let's say, around 750 to 150 BCE (and the canon of which books to include wasn't decided until some centuries later). We have lots of books written before that period.

Even if we grant that many older books were forgotten for much of history -- the hundreds of ancient Mesopotamian, Levantine, and Egyptian ancient texts that we have today -- even so, from the same period we have hundreds of books written by Greek authors. Nearly all of *Genesis* is younger than Hesiod and Homer. In the case of *Daniel*, we even have some books by Roman (Plautus) and Berber-Roman (Terence) authors that are older. Some New Testament texts contain quotations from pagan Greek books. Proto-*Isaiah* (*Isaiah* 1-39) is older than any Greek books -- but it isn't older than, say, *Gilgamesh*, which was still circulating in the 1st century BCE.

> And, for a while, literally, there was only one book, and that book was the Bible, and then, before it was the Bible, it was scrolls and writings on papyrus, but we were starting to aggregate written text together. And it went through all sorts of technological transformations, and then it became books that everybody could buy -- the book everybody could buy -- and the first one of those was the Bible. And then became all sorts of books that everybody could buy, but all those books, in some sense, emerged out of that underlying book, and that book itself -- 

It's hard to extract any concrete claims from this rambling. 'Scrolls and writings on papyrus' was the normal medium for publishing books in antiquity. 'Books that everybody could buy' were on sale in 5th century BCE Athens, nearly a millennium before the Bible was compiled. It's insane to claim that the *Book of the Dead* and the *Odyssey* and the *Aeneid* 'emerged out of' the Bible.

There have indeed been technological transformations over the millennia, but they have nothing to do with the Bible, except in that the Bible benefited from them. The use of alphabets (in western languages) rather than abjads, the use of parchment rather than papyrus, the use of the codex rather than the scroll, the use of minuscule writing rather than uncial: the Bible didn't drive any of these. It just benefited from them, in exactly the same way that every other book did. The first book we know of to be published in codex format (pages bound at the spine, as opposed to a scroll) and put on sale in a public bookshop wasn't the Bible, it was Ovid's *Metamorphoses* (reported in Martial [14.192](https://archive.org/details/martialepigrams02martiala/page/506/mode/2up?view=theater)) --

> Look at this bulk! It's built out of many-layered leaves!  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It holds fifteen books of Naso's poem.

The speaker finishes with the only true claim in their statement:

> the Bible isn't a book; it's a library. It's a collection of books.

The individual texts in the Bible were written by various different authors at various different times over a period of many centuries: roughly 750-150 BCE in the case of the Hebrew Bible, roughly 40s-110s in the case of the Christian New Testament. For each corpus, the idea of compiling them together into a single canon is considerably later. The Torah (*Genesis-...-Deuteronomy*) was probably assembled not too long after the Exile, so roughly 5th-4th centuries BCE; *Joshua-Judges-Samuel-Kings* may have been assembled as a unit around the same time. The full Hebrew canon was decided centuries later, reaching its final form sometime not too long before 200 CE. A Christian canon was in the process of being formed in the late 100s (a fragment of a canonical list of texts survives from that time, the Muratorian Canon) but the full western Christian canon wasn't finalised until the Council of Rome in 382 CE. The deuterocanonical books weren't excised from Protestant Bibles until the 1500s. Based how the speaker refers to this history, though, it isn't clear how much of this they've grasped. Given how they understand the word 'book', my guess is: not much.

"A note to this: how to best preserve digital images is still less known than how to best preserve a photocopy, so depending on how you make the paper copy, there's a good chance it might actually be more stable in the long run. It's why the National Archives still recommends microfilming over digitization as a secondary preservation method. We know film lasts for ages. We're already having problems opening files from a couple years ago. Digitization wins for ease of access and searchability but digital files can get corrupted or file types can lose support or they get compressed until the information is borderline useless.

You're absolutely correct a feeder tray would be terrible, but flatbed scanners are by far better over photographing documents. You get a flat image, lighting doesn't mess with color/white balance, the image won't be warped, and you'll get a clean background. 

Notes for weighing down: be gentle and don't use things that will leave marks or other residues (no pens or pencils, nothing with sticky substances on the bottom, etc.). If something has a significant crease, don't put pressure on it. Short of consulting a professional paper conservator (the best option), open it gently as far as it will go and let it slowly relax open by itself until you can put pressure that won't break open the paper on the creases. 

When imaging: always make sure your file types are either TIFF or PDF at the minimum. They are lossless file formats (JPGs are liable to lose quality every time you do anything to the file). Scan in the fullest color available and use no less than 300 DPI. If digital storage space is not a concern, use 600-800 DPI. I like to leave the scanner bed open so there's a nice black edge surrounding everything. Try to make sure there's a clear border around the whole document so it's clear the entire object was captured and there are no missing parts. Always scan both sides, even if one side is blank because that tells people it's definitely blank - leave no questions. 

Create a solid file naming convention. Record what it means and how you chose it. Save it as a README.txt file in the folder with all the images. In this text file, also include what equipment you used to capture the image, what settings you used, when you did the thing, and how you manipulated the image if you did. Metadata is everything. 

Check on your records periodically. This is where my expertise ends but files get corrupted, data gets compressed, hard drives die, and other weird things happen. You can lose it even when the file seems to be sitting in front of you."

"I wouldn't call it ""hysteria"" (""exaggerated or uncontrollable emotion or excitement"") — the USA and the USSR both _were_ threatened by the possibility of nuclear war. The USSR even more than the USA for most of it; the USA [ringed the USSR with airbases full of nuclear-armed bombers](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/US-nuclear-bomber-deployments-1945-1958.jpg) by the 1950s, with war plans that would leave the USSR a ""smoking, radiating ruin at the end of two hours,"" as one of the US officers involved in the planning put it. This was followed up by ICBMs, short-range nuclear missiles, submarine-launched missiles, atomic artillery, etc. Through the 1960s, the balance of nuclear strength was disproportionately in the US's favor; only in the 1970s was there a real ""parity"" in terms of both sides being able to inflict identical damage to one another, though even by the 1960s the USSR was capable of doing great harm to the USA. 

I would not consider fallout shelters, duck and cover, etc., to be ""hysterical"" under those circumstances: they were part of the US Civil Defense program, the goal of which was to try and mitigate (as much as possible) the effects of a nuclear exchange that the politicians felt may not be preventable, to keep as much of the US ""alive"" after it so that recovery might be to some degree possible. It is easy to laugh at this stuff in retrospect when you do not respect the very real sense of danger that existed at the time, though I have found in recent months that Americans are getting a taste for that feeling once again. Many of the Cold War CD policies were flawed in many ways (e.g. city evacuation was just not going to work for major metropolises), many were only of relative help (e.g. they would not save everyone but would lower the number of casualties), many were very specific to their specific strategic moment (_Duck and Cover_ is good advice for 1951, but it was inadequate by the 1960s, when the size and power of the Soviet arsenal was larger, and fallout the more pertinent ""survivable"" threat). It is unfortunately very misunderstood, having turned into a political hot potato in the US and Europe by both the left and the right in the 1980s. 

That out of the way, your question comes down to, ""were there Soviet Civil defense programs, public service announcements, etc.?"" And the answer is: yes. The Soviet Union did have Civil Defense programs that were similar in many ways to the American ones. They had fallout shelters, public blast shelters, various forms of public education programs that were aimed at schoolchildren and adults alone, etc. I am not aware of anything quite as kitschy as _Duck and Cover_, which is extreme kitsch by any standard. The most famous Soviet Civil Defense document in the West is _[Grazhdanskaya Oborona](http://bunker-datacenter.com/plakat.go/)_ (""Civil Protection""), a textbook of Civil Defense (this one from 1986, but apparently it was first issued originally in 1970), which is rather beautiful to my eyes, illustrated in the _lubok_ style of a peasant woodcut.

The real historical question about Soviet Civil Defense was, how ""for real"" was it? In the 1970s and 1980s there were accusations by hawks in the US that the Soviet CD program was lightyears beyond the (always anemic) US program, and that Soviet strategists felt nuclear war was thus ""survivable"" and would be more willing to wage it. While the Soviet CD program was definitely better-funded than the American one — no great feat given how much of a low priority CD was (the US fallout shelter program was, ultimately, aimed at convincing people to _build their own_ — indeed, much of the US program was no more than an information campaign, not a real infrastructure project), there is no evidence that they regarded it as any serious ""hedge"" or incorporated it into a more belligerent warfighting strategy, and how ""useful"" it was is rather debatable.

He will have a book out on this soon, I believe, but in the meantime, the best comparative history of the US and Soviet Civil Defense programs is Edward M. Geist, ""Two World of Civil Defense: State, Society, and Nuclear Survival in the USA and USSR, 1945-1991,"" Ph.D. diss., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2013. For what it is worth, I think the most important aspect of Civil Defense in the United States is that it caused Americans to face up, with some sobering honesty, about the possibility of nuclear war; to this end, I am one of the launchers of the [Reinventing Civil Defense Project](http://reinventingcivildefense.org) which seeks to think about what Civil Defense might look like, and ought to look like, in the 21st century."

"Yes, absolutely! Yugoslavia is perhaps the most famous case of this happening, due to the scale and success of the Partisan movement and the subsequent prominence of its leaders in the postwar state. Similar factors in Italy also led to similar outcomes, while France was noteable in that actual Spaniards who had fled Spain at the end of the civil war - many of whom were still being held in makeshift refugee/internment camps by 1940 - were hugely important in shaping resistance movements in south-west France. In each case, while their experience of fighting in Spain wasn't necessarily directly comparable to partisan warfare, it was still more relevant experience than most partisans had. Combined with their political standing and experience, this made veterans of the International Brigades natural leaders for communist partisan movements. 

In terms of the continuity of motivation, there is some ambiguity caused by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, in that IB veterans who were card-carrying communists were not necessarily in favour of this new 'imperialist' war that broke out in September 1939. Many ex-volunteers of course did not toe the Party line, and were enthusiastic participants in the war effort. Others dragged their feet until 1941 and the USSR took a sudden renewed interest in anti-fascist action.

If you want more detail on trajectories between Spain and WW2, there's a recent special issue in *War in History* on this exact phenomenon, with articles from several excellent scholars plus some idiot called Fraser."
"> If I understand all this correctly, documentation of ""whiteness"" and ""blackness"" in medieval Europe was entirely based on the morality of being christian or non-Christian?

That's a big part of it, but not all. Christian artists general depict Jewish people as light-skinned, for one thing. But even with Islam, the 13th-century *Book of Games* from Iberia features [light-skinned Muslim women](https://i.imgur.com/k9gyoCq.jpg) and both light and darker skinned Muslim men. 

I think it's more that medieval people had a different understanding altogether of what made their version of ""race"". I didn't go into it here at all because it's a complicated and separate topic, but there are also whole behavioral codes and *climate theory* tied in there.

Suzanne Conklin Akbari's book *Idols in the East: European Representations of Islam and the Orient, 1100-1450*, is utterly fascinating on these points (including Christian ethnographic writing and art on Jewish people) and [pretty darn affordable](https://www.amazon.com/Idols-East-European-Representations-1100-1450-ebook/dp/B007X5C6D4) on Amazon and similar, if you or anyone is interested in the topic!

">But of course, this doesn't tell us when the floor became lava, just that children have probably been avoiding the floor as long as they have been playing games. That particular permutation seems to be a development of the mid\-20th century.

I put a bit of time into a broad search and didn't come up with anything you did not share here, save the simple observation from a folkorist that ""Siblings in a variety of locations claim to have invented games like ""Hot Lava,"" where they jump from item to item and avoid touching the floor because it is hot lava. Most students admit that these games are created and played out of boredom, but stories about them later bring happy memories.""See RUDY, JILL TERRY. ""Family Folklore."" *International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family*, edited by James J. Ponzetti, 2nd ed., vol. 2, Macmillan Reference USA, 2003, pp. 583\-588.

Based on anecdotal evidence from these searches, references to this game in American sources popped up mostly after WWII. I would imagine there's a link between the flood of interest in Hawaii surrounding statehood and volcanoes in the same period; I found lots of references to Hawaiian tourism promotion in the 1960s, for example, that noted volcanoes as attractions. Kilauea was pretty active in the 1950s\-1960s; there were 19 stories in the NY Times in 1959 alone mentioning Kilauea, several of them in stories about statehood. (For example, this front page headline: "" Hawaiian Volcano Erupts and Spurts Lava 200 Feet: VOLCANO CRATER ERUPTS ON HAWAII"" *New York Times* (1923\-Current file);16 Nov 1959: 1.) It seems logical that Boomer children would have been familiar with volcanoes due to the broader cultural fascination with Hawaii/Polynesia during their childhoods and the incorporation of new curricular materials on volcanism that were introduced as a result of the International Geophysical Year and the post\-Sputnik emphasis on science education which all aligned c.1959. (I certainly remember playing the game in the early 1970s while learning about volcanoes in public school.)

This doesn't shed much light on the origins, but it may suggest avenues of inquiry as to the game's popularity and ubiquity in the US in the post\-war era\-\- it just happened to correspond with media coverage of the only source of red\-hot lava in the US at a time when Americans were excited about the new state of Hawaii."

"PART I

Well, by (probably) murdering one of their members, they unintentionally provided the infrastructure for the political movements that would eventually end up evolving into the Republican party, so perhaps that qualfies as done this and done that?

I can't speak with great detail about the conspiracy myths surrounding the Masons - especially those outside the United States - but I'll start with a great quote on how rabid the opposition had become by 1830:

>""Lebbeus Armstrong, a New York minister and prominent (and early)
seceding Mason, suggested in his 1830 pamphlet, *Masonry Proved to
be a Work of Darkness*, that if the lodge went unchecked, the United
States would have a Masonic monarchy for its government, a Masonic
church, a ""Masonic way to a Masonic heaven, and blood and massacre and destruction to all who subscribe not to the support of the Monarch.""

To understand how all this started, it's probably worth looking at the demographics of Masons at the time of the Revolution.  George Washington was, of course, the most famous Mason of them all, but individuals like Adams, Jefferson, and Madison had no interest in the organization - and membership was probably at most about 5000 out of a total population of about 2.5 million.  By 1800, the organization had grown to around something like 15000, but what's the important takeaway here is that despite the relatively small size, their holding of political offices were disproportionately far larger; one study of early 19th century Western New York revealed half of both party central committees of the time consisted of Masons.

This had a lot to do with the traditional methods of obtaining political power in democracies - it helps to have already powerful friends vouching for you - but there was another aspect to this, which was some studies have suggested that the religious and political demographics played a significant role.  Masons were predominantly Episcopalian (ranging to outright deist), often Jeffersonian Republicans (and therefore allies of France), and usually urban.

These traits did not play well in Federalist, Congregationalist, Francophobe New England, and in the brutal partisanship of the 1790s, establishing your opponents as the tool of Satan was considered good campaigning.

>""By the late 1790s certain New England Federalists with Antimasonic tendencies had tried to establish a connection between the Masonic lodges in the United States and a notorious secret European organization known as the ""Bavarian Illuminati,"" alleged to be part of Freemasonry. Masons were accused of fomenting political revolutions to promote anarchy and to destroy all forms of authority.  A (1797 Scottish tract) *Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All Religions and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meeting of the Free Masons, Illuminati and Reading Societies* (declared) Illuminati dominated lodges now flourished in the United States, (which were amplified by) renowned geographer and clergyman the Reverend Jedidiah Morse of Charlestown, Massachusetts, who, in several well-publicized sermons of 1798-1799, declared that the Illuminati intended to subvert American political and religious institutions. Morse pointed to a lodge in Portsmouth, Virginia, composed of
French exiles, as living proof of this conspiracy.

The furor died down somewhat once anti-French fears faded and Jeffersonian Republicans did not, indeed, orchestrate The Terror American Style upon dominating politics for the next quarter century, but the embers of envy against an exclusive, exclusionary, politically powerful organization remained - and as it turned out, Western New York just happened to be settled largely by Congregationalist, ex-Federalist New Englanders.

This set up one of those genuinely fascinating and quirky events in American political history.  An alcoholic, often destitute stonemason named William Morgan (who in 1819 had married the 16 year old daughter of a Methodist minister at the age of 45) had somehow gained membership to one of the Masonic Lodges in Western New York, quite possibly by reading one of the many already existing British exposes on Masonic rituals which would have given him enough basic knowledge to pretend to be a Mason from his native Virginia.  Given the other aspects of his character, it's probably not surprising other Western New York Masons decided he really wasn't someone they wanted in their club, not only refusing him membership in their latest branch in Batavia but also blackballing him from a rather needed job constructing it.

Morgan sought revenge in the most American way: writing his own expose in 1826, the *Illustrations of Masonry*, which provided every detail of the first three levels of New York Masonry and that he expected would make him rich (given his initial partners promised $500,000, even though they didn't deliver, he might have been onto something.) Unfortunately for him, the local Masons were both unaware that similar tracts had long been available overseas and went to work on suppressing the book with every tool available.  First, in early September 1826 a mysterious fire was set at the book's print shop (which local Masons strenuously denied, offering a $100 reward to anyone who could offer evidence they were responsible.)  That same day, another Mason obtained a warrant for an outstanding debt of the princely sum of $2.69 - that for the May theft of a shirt and cravat from a tavern keeper when he'd stayed overnight.  While initially released for lack of evidence, Morgan made the mistake of admitting the debt and was jailed.

Unfortunately for him, the debt was paid off by the same Mason who'd gotten the warrant in the first place, and at ""about 9:00P.M., a shrill whistle sounded, and the jailer's wife rushed to the window, only to see Morgan struggling with two men and shouting ""Murder!"" A yellow carriage appeared, and four men threw Morgan into it. The carriage went ""clattering"" into the night, and Morgan was never seen in public again.""  In some ways, thereafter Morgan turned into the 1830s version of Elvis, being supposedly spotted in the Ottoman Empire and Honduras, with another report claiming he'd become an Indian chief, and yet another that he was somehow found out in Cuba and hanged for his crimes as a pirate.

Despite all the inquiries made in years to come, nobody ever really figured out what happened to Morgan besides that he may have been offered a deal to keep his silence for some cash and a farm in Canada and to live quietly and incognito (which is what Masons afterwards had claimed was his fate.)  More likely, the third (!) special prosecutor assigned to his case in 1831 concluded that he probably was held at the then-abandoned Fort Niagara for the next week, had at least a couple of the sixty-nine Masons who were eventually linked with the response panic as the Canada deal fell apart, was murdered, and was weighted down and dumped in the Niagara River.  (A later body that floated up was first definitively identified by a Canadian to be her late farmer husband, then shaved to look like Morgan - the farmer had sideburns and hair, Morgan was bald - then finally released into the custody of the very confused widow.)

For a region already predisposed against the elites who'd become Masons, this presented a tinderbox; one estimate suggested half of the local county officials were in fact Masons - along with the then-Governor of New York, DeWitt Clinton.  An 1827 trial for the three Masons who'd actually kidnapped Morgan resulted in incredibly light sentences (ranging from one month to two years, although in fairness kidnapping at the time was bizarrely enough a misdemeanor) but as they plead guilty no additional evidence was obtained.  This did not calm things; between 1826 and 1831, no less than twenty grand juries were empaneled, 54 Masons indicted, 39 tried (with 10 convictions having prison sentences from 30 days to 28 months), and a state assemblyman, Francis Granger, had gotten got shot down by the state legislature by a 3-1 margin to try to move the whole mess out of Western New York.

However, probably the single most important development was that in 1829 the second special prosecutor of the case (bizarrely enough the defense counsel of the first defendants who'd plead guilty) was appointed by now-Governor Martin Van Buren, and what happened afterwards is what I'll discuss in part II of this answer."

(Truly, I don't know. But the original source breaks from Latin to insist upon ""coppewebbes,"" and ones that are packed down to take up space and weight. It's possible this was an accusation meant to make dust sound worse than it is, but that's sheer speculation.)"
"Tunnels were dug by special troops, usually those who had mining experience in civil life.  The purpose of these tunnels varied.  By and large, the notion was that of siege warfare of old- a technique called ""undermining."" 

In the olden days (think knights and castles) tunnels would be dug to the point of being underneath a supporting part of the structure.  These tunnels were shored by pieces of wood to keep them intact during construction, and the face would be piled with flammable objects set alight.  This would eventually burn through the wooden supports, collapsing the tunnel and the wall the ground above can no longer support.

In the American Civil War, during the siege of Vicksburg in 1863 as an example, tunnels were dug from the Union positions under the Confederate entrenchments.  The tunnel ended in a large gallery which was packed with gunpowder and set off, obliterating the Confederate positions above, and leaving a large crater.  Tactical incompetence and poor preparation for a follow-up assault allowed the Confederates to rally and defend this crater before the Union troops could seize it.  As with many Civil War battles, casualties were high.

This practice continued in the First World War, with both sides digging tunnels to undermine their enemy's positions, using a high explosive called ammonal in place of old-timey gunpowder.  A single mine could eradicate thousand of men at a time.  Through trial and error, the practice of tunneling became more coordinated with infantry assaults, making these tactics more and more successful as the war went on.

Tunnels were not only for undermining.  In some instances, as with the Canadian Corps at Vimy during the Battle of Arras in the Spring of 1917, tunnels were dug from friendly positions to points well into No-man's Land.  When the assault began on the morning of 9 April, Canadians came up through the ground rather than going over the top, shortening the distance to be travelled overland to their objectives.  These tunnels are still present, and some remain in safe enough condition for tourists to visit.

Of course, with both sides digging mines and counter mines (i.e. blowing up your enemy's mine before his mine could blow up you) and sometimes devolved into hand-to-hand combat when tunnels sometimes met.

An excellent film to watch which gives a good impression of what life was like for tunnellers and miners is ""Beneath Hill 60."""
"There are two major factors governing the linguistic difficulty of *Gawain* as opposed to *Canterbury Tales*: dialect and poetry form. Chaucer is planted firmly in the world of the London clerical bureaucracy, clerks writing first and foremost for a ""reading circle"" type audience of other clerks, whose literary influence through ""reading for fun"" and through essentially running local and national bureaucracy did a lot to standardize the Midland-Kent dialects swirling around London into standard English.

The anonymous *Gawain* poet (usually known as the *Pearl* poet, although there are a few scholars who have questioned whether the two poems were *really* written by the same author), on the other hand, wrote in a northwestern-ish dialect, a version of the West Midlands dialect. That places the vocabulary a step removed from what we know in Chaucer--a step removed from the type of Middle English that would flow into early modern.

The second major factor is the type of verse. *Canterbury Tales* is governed first of all by meter with different rhyming patterns falling at the end of the line. SGGK uses alliterative verse, a specific format heralding back to Old English/Anglo-Saxon heritage that was undergoing a revival in just the part of England where SGGK's dialect places its author. The alliteration demands of alliterative verse not only suggest that a wider vocabulary would be necessary to make the patterns work--we think that using as wide a vocabulary as possible was part of the literary game and fun for authors writing in the style. I wish I remembered the exactly number--I think SGGK uses something like twelve or thirteen different words for ""man."" 

As far as contemporary perceptions of language--yes, medieval people recognized both the general borders of many modern vernacular languages *and* the differences in dialect. Sometimes this is explicit. In mid-14C Germany, Heinrich von Nördlingen wrote to his friend Margaretha Ebner to tell her that he was sending a gift: a book by earlier mystical author Mechthild of Magdeburg. But, Heinrich said, *her* German was difficult so he had had a group of friends translate it into ""our"" German. Mechthild had originally written in Middle Low German (northern); the Bavarian-born Ebner's primary language was Middle High German. (It's tough to say whether medieval Low and High German qualify as ""separate languages""--you can certainly cherry-pick individual texts that seem like it, but they'd be the ends of the spectrum while many people spoken and wrote somewhere in the middle).

The activity of scribes suggests a similar view. Monks and nuns acquiring books for their convents ""translate"" freely from what we would call one dialect to another. They are clearly quite adept with the dialect of their exemplar, but for their own convent, it's easier to pop the text into the local dialect.

Honestly, the biggest difference is just *practice.* SGGK is tough because of the vocabulary (which is apparent already by comparing scholarly translations!), but take something in the middle difficulty range between CT and SGGK--like Piers Plowman B. You're probably going to struggle at the beginning, but by the end, you'll practically be able to speak in Langland's verse and vocabulary."

"Not necessarily, or perhaps more accurately, not in the twelfth century when Benjamin is writing. For this we have to look not to the centuries of Islamic rule under the Umayyads and the early ta'ifa kingdoms but specifically to the Almohad dynasty that rules Islamic Iberia during Benjamin's lifetime.

The Almohads, like the Almoravids before them, came to power first in North Africa as a deeply, zealously *Islamic* Berber ruling dynasty. They swept into the relative anarchy of the little ""taifa"" kingdomlets in southern Iberia and solidified their hold militarily--and religiously.

The Almohads were determined to create and maintain a *Muslim* society, which first of all meant making sure that Muslims themselves adhered to strict standards of faith and practice. 

Secondarily (both in terms of time and in terms of motivation/attention), they focused on non-Muslim natives of their territory. Jews and Christians in al-Andalus and North Africa found themselves subject to economic and physical coercion to convert or emigrate. (The Almohads had no trouble hiring non-Muslims mercenaries from *outside* their borders to fight in their armies, of course! Just, the people who actually lived there). At the same time, Christian rulers sweeping south across Iberia were quite eager to invite Jews to come populate the sparsely-settled interior peninsula, especially with Jewish money and knowledge of how to cultivate/manage the Mediterranean climate land. So one of the patterns scholars identify is that by the time of final Christian conquest of the south, there were basically no Christians or Jews left living in the last pieces of Islamic territory.

For Benjamin extrapolating backwards from his present circumstances, then, Islamic rule in Iberia and across the Pyrenees (in the early Middle Ages, which is the specified context here, Muslims ruled stretches of southern France) was not an ""ornament of the world"" of *convivencia*, even if Christian rule was also less than ideal."
"You are right. I have looked at the arrival data,  resources.huygens.knaw.nl. 
And all ships at that period that made it back did so between June and November. And a mean around Juli and August. Therefore they were not completely random, instead it looks like a normal distribution. This would still allow for speculating, but my statement of randomness was wrong."
"This is extremely interesting, but I’m finding it hard to see how a thin length of chain covering only a small portion of the face offers much practical protection, even against bayonets and sabers: Bayonets primarily used stabbing/thrusting attacks (or so I thought, based on the few bayonet fighting videos and pamphlets I’ve seen, which tended to emphasize striking the neck), and while I could see the curb-chain having a non-zero benefit against the slashing attack of a mounted cavalryman’s saber, I can’t imagine those tall bearskin hats actually managed to stay on during an all-out melee (though that’s purely conjecture on my part).


Are there records from that time indicating that curb-chains reliably provided meaningful protection in combat?"

"Hi, there's plenty to be said on this but while you wait for a newer answer, you may be interested in [this section of our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/art#wiki_visual_arts) on ""realism"" in visual arts. It makes a couple points to consider: 

* firstly, art in a given culture has meaning that goes beyond ""realism"" as a goal -- consider Egyptian tomb paintings as an example of art that's stylized, or paintings/illustrations in medieval manuscripts that depicts people in certain ways for religious or spiritual reasons; 

* second, the ""quality"" of artists is not universally distributed -- the sculptures from the ancient world which are extant and depicted widely comport to the ideal art forms of the Renaissance and beyond, when perspective and ""realism"" in visual arts are highly prized. The person who sculpted the statue of Laocoön is very much not likely to be the same person who painted the fresco you linked, and picking examples that are widely separated don't tell us a lot about realism -- the Fayyum [mummy portraits](https://thearthistoryjournal.blogspot.com/2011/01/fayum-mummy-portraits.html) are realistic by our standards, while other attempts to paint or repair paintings by a well-meaning gran can go [pretty badly wrong](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19349921)."

Wow ok this is like PhD level. Thank you!
"The P'urépecha state, *Irechecua Tzintzuntzani* (literally ""The Kingdom of Tzintzuntzan"") was the third largest state in the Americas at the time of Spanish conquest, behind the Inca and Aztec empires. They occupied a territory of 75,000 square kilometers (about the size of Scotland) at the time of Spanish arrival, and were larger than that in their past. They were perhaps the most centralized state in Mesoamerica, had a sophisticated network of border fortifications, and are one of the few pre-Columbian states to not just successfully resist an Aztec Invasion, but soundly defeat them. So I would say, yes, they were in a ""state of similar standing"" to the Aztecs.

The reason we don't hear more about it is that it hasn't been studied as much. In contrast to the Aztecs, our historical sources on the P'urépecha are much thinner. The main historical source, the *Relacion de Michoacán*, is pretty much all there is on the pre-Columbian history. There are few minor sources, like the *Lienzo de Jicalán* or *La Memoria de Don Melchor Caltzin*, but these discuss specific, isolated events. They don't provide the overview narrative history that we need to flesh in lots of the details. While there are a few colonial era sources, like the *Relaciones Geograficas*, there isn't really anything comparable to the numerous Spanish chroniclers and native historians that we have for the Aztecs. This is largely due to the fact that the Aztecs provided a stiff resistance to the Spanish, and their state became the backbone of the Spanish colonial administration after the conquest. The P'urépecha, by contrast, surrendered without fighting because they were dealing with the smallpox outbreak and a coup when the Spanish entered the territory. Rather than forming the basis for a colonial administration, their political institutions were largely cut out of the colonial system in the 17th century when the Spanish decided to make their own regional capital (modern day Morelia) to bypass native authority.

On the archaeology side, the region has been heavily understudied as well. Early work started with Alfonso Caso and some of his disciples doing some cursory excavations at the civic-ceremonial core of the capital, Tzintzuntzan, in the early 20th century. The region was largely ignored from that point until the late 1970s when Hellen Pollard did her PhD dissertation on the urban layout of the capital. Pollard did some further work on some of the smaller cities on the west side of the lake basin in the 1980s, and at the same time her colleague Shirley Gorenstein did some archaeological work on the northeastern frontier. There were a few other historians and archaeologists during this period, but prior to the start of the 21st century I can literally count on my hands the number of people who seriously studied the region in an academic capacity. One can contrast this to the Maya region where you can't throw a rock without hitting another archaeologist.

As to why the region is understudied, there's a kind of feedback loop in the research of Native American cultures. People look at the (lack of) existing research, conclude that the region is not interesting or doesn't have anything worth pursuing, and therefore they don't study it. It's much easier to get grant money studying a culture like the Aztecs, or the Maya, where you *know* you'll find something. Since nobody researches it, nobody finds anything, and so nobody looks. Up until very recently, the general conclusion was that despite the size of the empire the area was a cultural backwater that only recently acquired urban civilization. In fact, if you pick up any book or article written before about 2010 it would tell you that there were no cities in Michoacán prior to the formation of the P'urépecha state, and that the P'urépecha lacked even a pictographic script like the Aztecs. (We now know neither of these assumptions were true.)

Luckily, this situation is now changing as there is a renewed interest in the region. There's been a lot of recent research on the culture, but unfortunately little of this research has been published in English. A French team organized through Centre d'Études Mexicaines et Centroaméricaines (CEMCA) conducted a decades long project studying the Zacapu Basin (the lake basin immediately north of Lake Pátzcuaro where the empire formed). This project has published extensively in both French and Spanish, but almost none of their work is available in English. An American team organized principally through Colorado State University has for several years been studying an extremely large city on the east side of the Lake Basin that was not previously known to archaeologists. The results of this research are likely to completely rewrite our history of P'urépecha state formation, but unfortunately little of that research has been published as of yet, outside of PhD dissertations and a few cursory overview articles. There's also a Mexican team organized through UNAM who is actively working on a site south of the Lake Pátzcuaro basin which is just now getting started.

The issue is that so much of this research is so new that it will take time for the academic arguments to shake out into a new consensus. I imagine that, in a few years (or decades), we will probably have enough information for somebody to write a new synthesis.

I will add sources and other info to this post later if people are interested. There are a few English language articles available that can provide a sense of the current scholarship. But right now it's really late where I am so I'm going to bed and I'll add more info tomorrow.

EDIT:

Okay, I'm awake and I've had my coffee. First, I want to direct people to the [relevant section](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/americas/latinamerica#wiki_tarascan) of the AskHistorians book list. The two books on there are the standard introductory works, but both are out of date by this point. I'd still recommend them for people coming fresh to the topic with no background knowledge, as there isn't really anything comparable that incorporates new research.

Another recent book that is a fantastic read is [Afandor-Pujol's book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Relación_de_Michoacán_1539_1541_an/Q8BjCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) analyzing the main historical source. This book is about the early colonial period more than the pre-Columbian state, but it provides the best breakdown of how to view the primary source material I've seen. It is this book which argues (rather conclusively) that the P'urépecha did indeed have pictographic writing like the Aztecs.

There have been two recent PhD dissertations that provide the most comprehensive overview so far of the American lead research at the (probably misnamed) site of Angamuco on the east side of the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin. The first, by [Anna Cohen](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37012), looks at the site's ceramic chronology. The second, by [Rodrigo Solinis-Casparius](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/44938), looks at the site's road network. You can download both as pdfs through the link provided (the pdf link itself is on the left hand side of the page). Being dissertations, these book-length documents are very data heavy. If you decide to read them, you may want to skip over most of the body chapters and focus on the intro and conclusion chapters, unless you have a burning curiosity for the nuts and bolts of archaeological research.

Other articles on this research are unfortunately locked behind paywaylls. If you have access to an academic library, there's a [chapter in a book](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-6074-9_16) written by the project's director which provides an overview of the site. There has also been a recent publication on architecture at the site, also behind a paywall [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-antiquity/article/typology-of-ancient-purepecha-tarascan-architecture-from-angamuco-michoacan-mexico/AD00553339FA5628A4FA1A344EDF5B36).

A few of you also asked for Spanish language sources. The French project working in the Zacapu basin has published a great overview in Spanish available [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/latin-american-antiquity/article/typology-of-ancient-purepecha-tarascan-architecture-from-angamuco-michoacan-mexico/AD00553339FA5628A4FA1A344EDF5B36). Another overview of the project offering a different perspective was written by Charlotte Arnauld (2015 - ""Evolución de la ocupación humana en el centro-norte de Michoacán"" in *Génesis, culturas, y espacios*). I can't find a copy of it online, unfortunately. The entire full text of the *Relacion de Michoacán* is also available on the [Colegio de Michoacán's website](http://etzakutarakua.colmich.edu.mx/proyectos/relaciondemichoacan/) along with other helpful information on things like geography.

The most active Mexican archaeologist studying the P'urépecha is Jose Luis Punzo Diaz. Most of his research up until now has been looking at the Epiclassic Period (600-900 AD) site of Tingambato, which predates the formation of the state by many centuries. His articles on this, which you can find by [searching his name on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C6&q=jose+luis+punzo+diaz) are largely on really specialized topics. Results of dating techniques, geophysical prospection, ceramic analysis, etc. There isn't much in the way of synthesis articles. He has recently started a new project south of the Lake Pátzcuaro basin looking at a site closer to the period of the P'urépecha state, but to my knowledge there haven't been any big publications on that yet. He just started a few years ago.

If anyone has any specific questions about any of this research, or anything else on the P'urépecha, I will be happy to answer them."
"A popular miracle story--in collections submitted as part of a sort of ""application package"" for someone's sainthood, i.e. completely legitimate in both the Church's and general Christians' eyes--was despondent parents visiting a shrine with their dead or stillborn infant, and the saint reviving the child *just long enough* for it to be baptized. Some saints, like St. Faith/Sainte Foy, were rather well known for performing this type of miracle.

You can call it misrepresentation or not; to people in the Middle Ages, it wasn't, and what mattered was having as much confidence as possible that an infant who died too young was nevertheless in God's arms instead of the devil's."

"I'm not a historian, but a paleontologist, and I don't know if my response is allowed but I wanted to add my two cents before the usual explanation I hear gets posted. Many people posit that dragon myths are derived from cultures finding dinosaur bones in the ground, recognizing them as the remains of giant reptilian creatures, and developing myths of dragons.

I find this very, very unlikely, in most circumstances at least. There are two issues I see; 1) dinosaur fossils are usually found in remote areas with difficult terrain, and 2) dinosaur fossils are very difficult to recognize unless you're specifically looking for them.

Fossils occur in sedimentary rock layers, which need to be exposed through weathering at the surface for people to find them. Vegetation obscures fossils from sight and root action can break them apart, so arid areas are especially good for locating fossils.  Therefore, dinosaur fossils tend to be found in rugged badlands or deserts that are sparsely inhabited or traversed. The major fossil localities of the present day - the badlands of the Western U.S. and Canada, the Gobi desert, and the Sahara - were probably little explored by people from the cultures you are asking about.

More important, however, is that dinosaur fossils are barely recognizable in the ground to all but the trained eye. In movies, they're always present as fully articulated and complete specimens, in perfect relief against the rock. In reality, the vast majority of dinosaur remains are isolated bones or fragments of bone, which are often damaged by weathering from the surrounding rock matrix (which is how paleontologists locate new finds in the first place). They are usually not bone-colored, instead taking a new color from the mineral content of their matrix (North American fossils tend to be dark brown, for example). Unless you know the appearance of bone in a region, it will be exceedingly difficult to even tell bone fragments apart from the rock, and even more difficult to tell what an isolated fragment of bone came from without a robust understanding of comparative anatomy. There's a reason that paleontology was one of the last sciences to develop - it's predicated upon knowledge of both geologic processes and comparative anatomy, without which it is impossible to interpret most fossil remains. 

For these reasons, I find it exceedingly unlikely that fossil remains were the inspiration for any mythological creatures, save for possibly cyclopes, as the pygmy elephant skulls on which they may have been based were subfossils that were easily accessible to Mediterranean peoples. Dinosaur fossils in particular are so inaccessible and difficult to recognize that I am very skeptical of any claim that they are the root of dragon myths around the world.

Some sources:
http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6858 - peer-reviewed journal article (open access at the link) from last year that includes several field photos. What's interesting to note here is that these specimens are exceptionally complete and have white fossil bone (only found in the Gobi to my knowledge), and are still barely recognizable as bones, rather than white pebbles, in the field. 

Michael Benton, *Vertebrate Paleontology*, 3rd Edition (Blackwell Publishing) - a textbook about paleontology in general, and includes a chapter on the discovery and collection fossils, detailing the geographic areas where fossils are generally found and what types of rocks they are found in.

Adrienne Mayor, *The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times* (Princeton University Press) - for the opposing argument. This seems to be the work from which a great deal of modern speculation about the fossil origins of mythological creatures is derived. She details arguments about the role of pygmy elephants in cyclops myths, among others. One claim of hers I find particularly untenable is that *Protoceratops* fossils were the inspiration for the gryphon in Greek mythology - *Protoceratops* fossils are common but restricted to Mongolia, so it seems very unlikely that the Greeks would have ever seen one."

"This answer ignores the actual part where Bush ""stole"" the election, which I put in quotations because it's the central question OP is asking and up for debate. 

Basically, Gore asked for hand recounts in specific districts that were very close but, according to many studies after the fact, likely would have given him thousands of extra votes (in an election that had a margin in the hundreds of votes). Bush sued, and the *Florida Supreme Court* upheld the recount, allowing it to go forward. 

This was appealed to the *United States Supreme Court* which stopped the count on the grounds that because different counties were counting ballots differently, it falls under an ""equal protection"" law in the US. Critics of this say 1) it's wrong that the Supreme Court thought they knew Florida state law better than the Florida court, 2) it was very unusual for the conservative members of the Supreme Court (who usually support states' rights to choose their own laws) to essentially declare a conservative president by going against the own state's ruling, and 3) if we take this ruling to be true, then **every election in the history of the united states** goes against the ""equal protection"" law because ballots are *always* counted differently by county and is therefore invalid.

Essentially, the SCOTUS ruling in Bush v Gore overturned a state ruling that would have allowed more votes to be counted, which in turn basically handed the presidency to Bush who won by having the higher count by a razor thin margin. There is additional history here, including that the Florida Secretary of State (Katherine Harris) in charge of monitoring the election was co-chair of the Bush for President Election Committee, or the ""Brooks Brothers Riots"" where the republican party flew in lawyers and literal paid operatives, who protested outside of places counting votes and successfully stopped recounts outside of the legal process. But the crux of the ""steal"" question is the SCOTUS ruling"

"Zheng He served as fleet admiral under the Yongle Emperor. He conducted seven ‘Treasure Voyages’ with the Ming Treasure fleet, as a massive tour de force. These voyages went to various places in South East Asia, as well as India, and as far as East Africa and the Sinai peninsula [(Map)](https://sites.google.com/site/mingdynastyjslp/the-voyages-of-zheng-he). The aim of these voyages was to gain tribute from the various kingdoms considered under the ‘sphere’ of China; and thus the size of the fleet (supposedly one of the largest navies ever built with roughly 100-240 ships of various size) was impressive. The largest ships, the Treasure ships, were very large indeed, and some have argued that the largest ships in the fleet were over 100 metres long; however this is largely unverifiable, and is very questionable as it would make them at least twice the length of European vessels of the same period (thus it’s questionable whether construction of such a ship was physically possible in this period). It is much more likely that the ships were about 40-60 metres in length (still a very impressive size), in fact the Chinese built a replica ship for their museum which had a length of about 63 metres.

Zheng’s fleet collected much wealth in tribute, including some exotic gifts such as African animals such as Giraffes, the fleet also served a military purpose, as they carried a small army of an estimated 15-40 thousand men, which was often used to cow those that were not intimidated. Zheng’s voyages took place between 1405-1433, but after the Yongle Emperor died, Zheng slowly fell out of favour and the voyages ended in 1433. Not log after that, the Treasure fleet was burned, and China largely ended her foray into becoming a world-class naval power.

On to America, it has been speculated (emphasis on speculated) by certain people that one of Zheng He’s voyages was to America. This is a view espoused most popularly, by retired Submarine commander, Gavin Menzies, his argument is that China had the time, money etc to develop such a fleet, and he therefore speculates that China discovered America before Europeans, however his views basically amount to conspiracy theories, most serious academics have dismissed his claims, as Menzies produces very little evidence. His argument basically amounts to ‘Why not?’. Thus whilst I’d argue it’s true that Zheng’s voyages were remarkable, and their relatively recent rediscovery breaks certain perceptions of Ming China, it is probably untrue that he ever reached America, or Australia or New Zealand; there is simply little if no evidence apart from conspiracy theories. His voyages are very impressive by medieval maritime standards nonetheless.

Edit: After the destruction of Zheng’s fleet; the Ming Dynasty no longer had the desire to invest heavily in a world-class navy; they were instead much more concerned with internal struggles and controlling/ expanding their land borders, particularly in the South-East and in the North. As far as I know, interest in constructing a powerful navy would not take place in China until the late 19th century, during which China constructed several semi-modernised fleets which would ultimately lose to the Imperial Japanese Fleet in the first Sino-Japanese War (Despite how one-sided the conflict appears in hindsight, the Chinese fleet did pose a potential challenge to the IJN, and many in the West did not know initially which fleet would come out on top).

Edit 2: Wow, I didn't expect such a response, I'll attempt to answer questions to the best of my knowledge, using the sources in front of me ('China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty 1405-1433' by Edward Dryer, 'When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne, 1405-1433' by Louise Levathes and Sextants of Beijing). I apologise for delays in answering questions, I’ll try and get round to all of them, I want to make sure they are backed up by several sources which will take a bit more time for answers. 

Main source I used: ‘The Sextants of Beijing’ by Joanna Wayley-Cohen

Apologies if the answer is a bit long-winded I intended it as a correction to the previous comment"
"A Caliph is an individual able to command the respect of the Muslim community.  As such, the theological differences between Saudi's Salafi Islam and other Sunni sects created a non-trivial obstacle to reconciliation.

The Kingdom of Hejaz had the authority to make such a claim, given the legitimacy of the Hashemite dynasty.  As you may be aware, they were the custodians of Mecca and Medina for a thousand years, and to this day have a reputation for good character.  Jordan is still ruled by the Hashemite dynasty, and is known for accepting huge numbers of refugees from neighbouring Arab countries during times of crisis.

While it may be tempting to assume that the Muslim heartland is just Arabia, this is not true.  Jerusalem is the third holiest city in Islam, a region Saudi Arabia never controlled.  Jerusalem is regarded with great fondness by most Muslims, and the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock in the old city are sacred places.  Similarly, many places in Syria and Egypt have great cultural and historical significance for Muslims.  Damascus was the capital of previous Caliphates, and has long been a centre of Islamic learning.

To be recognised as a legitimate Caliph, in the traditional sense of unifying Muslims in their heartland, one really has to influence Palestine, Syria, and Arabia.  Saudi has never done that, while preceding Caliphates have.  The fractured state of the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire meant that nobody has been in a position to invoke the title with much seriousness.

One should understand that while the Hashemites claimed the title in the 1920s, during that era the region was in a state of flux.  It was possible that a Hashemite dynasty could have assembled a successor state from the ashes of the Ottomans.  But this did not happen.

During the First World War letters were exchanged between Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, and Lieutenant Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, British High Commissioner to Egypt.  The boundaries discussed would essentially have included most of Arabia, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine.  In that case the Hashemite dynasty could have legitimately claimed to be a Caliphate.  But the British government had made various promises to various parties in order to acquire as much support for the war as possible, and as such did not honour their negotiations with Hussein, who became King of Hejaz instead.

The Hashemites not only have Meccan pedigree, but they also briefly controlled East Jerusalem and the West Bank in Palestine in the aftermath of the first Arab-Israeli war.

Saudi Arabia could have claimed to be the Caliphate if their power extended to unify the Muslim heartland: inclusive of Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Egypt.  But though the House of Saud is undoubtedly super rich, they have never been powerful enough to force the issue.  Even if they did, their dynasty does not have the legitimacy of the Hashemites.

In conclusion, many have claimed to be a Caliph, but in order to become the Caliph you must unify the Islamic heartland; which is far more than just Mecca and Medina.  Saudi Arabia has never been able to do this, and has never claimed this as its intention either."
">They were not consistently half-starved; the average medieval farmer ate a nutritious, if bland, diet.

One thing I would add is that the medieval peasant's diet is better described as being repetitive than bland. Most peasants had a fairly substantial garden for vegetables and herbs and, when combined with meat or fish (depending on the day of the week) would allow for a fairly tasty diet, even if it was invariably bread and pottage for most meals. Fruit, either fresh when in season or sometimes dried, and cheese added variety and important nutrients to the diet as well."

well, there is a caveat that I think is important.
Although there are no gunshops similar to the US, where you could go and buy a pistol, revolver, rifle, etc., the are still plenty of Hunting and Sporting Stores all around the country that can legally sell low caliber ~~weapons~~ ammo to those with valid permit. Allowed calibers are .22, .25, .32 o .380 and .38 SPL. 

Its usually a few per big city and is tend to be visited by a small group of people that usually go to shooting ranges, have ranches or belongs to a hunting/shooting club. Its common for people in rural areas to be a gun owner and rare for city dwellers to do so. Yet you can find people that inherited old guns.

"We need to draw distinction between Greek and Roman naming. Herodotus, as you say, exclusively uses the name Libya.
In book 2 of the *Histories*, he argued that the Nile Delta does not divide ""Asia and Libya"" by this argument:
> ""If, then, my judgment is correct, the Ionians are mistaken in their opinions about Egypt; if, on the other hand, the Ionians are right, I am ready to prove that neither they not the rest of the Greeks know how to count: for they hold that the world consists of three parts – Asia, Europe, and Libya – whereas it is obvious that they should add a fourth, namely the Egyptian Delta, since they do not include it in either Asia or Libya. (2.16, trans. Aubrey de Selincourt, 1954)

Interestingly, this three continent notion persisted. Isidore of Seville, writing around AD 630, stated that 
> For this surrounding Ocean flows around in a circle at all boundaries. However, it is divided into three parts: from which one part is Asia, another Europe, and a third called Africa. 

> Vndique enim Oceanus circumfluens eius in circulo ambit fines. Divisus est autem trifarie: e quibus una pars Asia, altera Europa, tertia Africa nuncupatur. (Etymologiae 14)

But this isn't an apples to apples comparison by any means. When you look at contemporaries, you find that Greeks and Romans used different names for the same place for centuries.

The Romans used a term with varied etymological explanations, variously Latinate, Hebraic, or originating in a local name. The Romans associated it with the Carthaginians and the continent generally, according to [Lewis & Short](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=Africa&la=la&can=africa0&prior=in#lexicon). The Greeks' name derives from their ethnonym for the people living on the west bank of the Nile, according to the [Great Scott](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*libu%2Fh&la=greek&can=*libu%2Fh0&prior=h\(#lexicon).

When Polybius was writing his history of the Punic Wars in the 2nd century BC, he used the term Libya exclusively to describe activities taking place on that continent. But when the Romans added Carthage's territory to their growing empire, they named it Africa Proconsolaris (not Libya). And Cornelius Scipio's honorific agnomen was ""Africanus"" not based in ""Libya."" 

Furthermore, when Titus Livius described these same events in Latin one hundred years later, he described the same events using ""Africa"" exclusively. In the second and first century BC, we see Greeks using ""Libya"" for all land west of the Nile, and Romans using ""Africa"" to describe the same territory. Sallust used ""Africa"" for the continent as well, in his *[Jugurthine War](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Sal.%20Jug.%2089.7&lang=original)*. Throughout antiquity from Africanus down to Diocletian's designation of Diocese Africa and Justinian's reassertion of the territory as Prefectura Africa. To the Romans, the territory west of Egypt was Africa.

The Greeks persisted in using ""Libya"" in their language. 
Claudius Ptolemy (d. AD 170), the Alexandrian founder of Geography, used the Libya name as well. ""First of all, therefore, let us set down Europe which we separate from Libya by the Straits of Hercules..."" ([Prologue](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/Prologue*.html) to *Geography*). Procopius likewise used ""Libya"" in the *[Secret History](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/procop-anec.asp)* (c. AD 550). So while Justinian was reestablishing the province as Africa, Procopius was describing the event using the term Libya, parallel to Polybius describing the Romans' conquest of Carthaginian Africa. 

Muslim invaders adopted the Prefecture name, and it appears on maps consistently after the 7th century. I haven't been able to find references to a continental Libya after Procopius, so maybe someone can pick up from there."

"On the subject of ""waving"" pikes around:

As a bit of irony, as the pikemen's role on the battlefield became more psychological than physical, they were likely encouraged to do the exact opposite. Bernardino de Mendoza in 1594 thought that if you observed the enemy's pikes and standards start to move around a lot from a distance, especially those held by the rear ranks, then it was a sign that their morale was weakening and might indicate a good time to charge

>If the enimie waxing weake in the skirmishe, ye perceyue that in anie of his squadrons they departe from the harque∣buserie with which they were fortified, or emptie the depth, by the soldiers retiring from the last ranks, **the pykes to crosse one another, and the colours to moue with disorder. . .**

When the pikemen wanted ideally to prevent enemy footmen or horsemen from charging in the first place, the best way to do that then would be to keep standing tall with their pikes steady and pretend as though they *aren't* completely terrified.

The claim that soldiers would ""pretend"" to fight each other is certainly an interesting one, and I suspect that it's been extrapolated from the works of Machiavelli, who was writing long before the English civil war began, and was writing mainly about the italian condottiere mercenaries of the 15th century, not pikemen. Machiavelli really did not like mercenaries and had a lot of negative things to say about them. For instance his claim that during the italian battle of Anghiari, only a single soldier died and it was because he fell of his horse.

This is likely an exaggeration, and it's doubtful if even the condottiere ever really organized ""fake"" battles to fool onlookers. However there is good reason to assume that their conflicts likely were fairly ""bloodless"" compared to what came later. These mercenary groups generally fought in small scale, limited conflicts between various city states and did have a reputation for suddenly switching sides when things got bad or someone else offered better pay. We also know that by the start of the Italian Wars, the condottiere generals involved tended to heavily favor a Fabian strategy where they would try to defeat the enemy with delay and harrassment while avoiding pitched battles. This stands in stark contrast to the Swiss preference for seeking out aggressive, decisive battles as soon as possible.

The long, drawn out ""push of pike"" was generally something that occured around the time of the Italian Wars, when firepower generally had a smaller impact on battles overall and pikes often still outnumbered handgunners by as much as 9 to 1. Whether they involved long, drawn out ""pike fencing"" or a chaotic, close quarter ""pell mell"" though, fights between large columns of pikemen definitely tended to get pretty bloody, and if anything it only got worse over the course of the century as conflicts increasingly became more religious or nationalistic in nature."
"Edit: I have edited my original comment to include a link to this comment, as well as a clarification that I'm not intending to dismiss the later Revolution, but merely attempting to answer the question at hand!

I actually attack Schama pretty viciously in previous posts ;) I agree that Cobban is slanted as well. I wouldn't classify myself as working from any 'school' of Revolutionary thought. I'm perhaps most influenced by modern historians such as Timothy Tackett and Peter McPhee, as well as Lynn Hunt. I beleive that the Revolution has been fought over by extremes on both sides, and that many modern historians represent a middle ground that throughly goes over the facts. After reading through your post I certainly can comment on why I answered the way I did, and I believe that you and I have a lot of common ground here!

>I think you are *massively* undervaluing how bitterly anti-*monarchical* most Revolutionaries were after 1792

What I'm contending is that until the Flight to Varennes, and really until mid-1792, the French were not in favor of a Republic, or of overthrowing the monarchy. Robespierre wasn't even a proponent of a Republic until he was certain it was in place and stable, and even then dipped his toe in it before diving head-first. I *absolutely* agree that at the height of the Republic (1793-1794) those who supported the central government were **rabidly anti-monarchical**. You're absolutely correct in how virulent and radical the Revolution was during this period. The Revolutionaries under the Republic had a massive hurdle to surmount-- how to unite the ""French"" when there was no longer a common monarch to unite them. Lynn Hunt's *Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution* does a great job of diving into this, but essentially building up the grandeur of the Republic was seen as *essential* to promoting the unity of France. So we are certainly in agreement on this point!

However radically pro-Republic the French became during 1793-1794, though, was slowly eroded throughout the course of the Directory. I believe I touch on this in the linked answer, but the Directory is often lumped together as a placeholder from the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794 to Napoleon's coup in 1799. The problem with this is it's not often emphasized enough how long those 5 years actually were! Republican fervor can be seen as a bit of a bell curve, gradually rising until its peak under the Robespierrists from 1793-1794. After the Thermidorian reaction it's not as if the Republic was abandoned, but we can slowly see a loss of enthusiasm for the Republic over the intervening years. Much of this was the fault of the Robespierrists, or at least those who propogated the Terror, which became indelibly linked to the Republic, fairly or not, in France. Some of the fault also lies with the Directory not really pleasing anyone, and doing a generally good job of making no one happy, occupying as they did a middle position that struck down both the right and left with equal vigor. By the time Napoleon (and Sieyes, and Talleyrand, and others) effected the coups to usurp the Directory, there was little support for the Republic as consituted. Most were generally sick and tired of the Directory for one reason or another, and the initial Republican fervor had been cooled by the blood spilled during the Terror, and the langor that had set in around the Directory.

I think maybe the best summation of what I'm getting at is to point to your sentence:""So, why was it suddenly okay in 1800 to once again play the monarch...?""

The **suddenly** part in that sentence I think is where the misunderstanding lies. This absolutely was not a sudden about-face. 1794-1800 is six years, an enternity in French Revolutionary time. The French had been through 8 long years of constant warfare, two constitutions, 5+ different factions in the drivers seat, and had steadily lost their fervor for the Republic under the Directory.

I appreciate your post, and please let me know if you have further questions or disagreements with my viewpoint!"
"I'd love to piggyback on this excellent answer to say that Richard the Lionheart's modern mythos is due in no small part to the nationalist interpretation of the Crusades that emerged in the nineteenth century. Scholars like Joseph François Michaud popularized the idea of a uniquely French tradition of crusading - one that other countries sought to mimic. The Belgians had Godfrey of Bouillon, the Germans had Frederick Barbarossa (yes, despite the fact that he died before really doing anything on his expedition), and the British had... Richard the Lionheart? The king who loved England so much that he only spent about six months out of his ten year reign there? Indeed, Richard the Lionheart was very much his mother's son. And his mother was none other than Eleanor of Aquitaine, who preferred the warmer climate and more developed courtly culture of southern France (Langeduoc) to the dreary island of England. Nonetheless, the romanticist, nationalist interpretation of the Crusades that developed in the nineteenth century cast Richard the Lionheart in a largely positive light - the brave albeit crude counterpart to Saladin. It is no coincidence that the giant statue of Richard the Lionheart was constructed in 1851 in the midst of this nationalist fervor - not too long after Louis-Philippe I of France turned Versailles into a museum and sponsored a number of works within it that depicted French heroism during the Crusades.

There are a number of fantastic works that trace the development of the mythos of crusading from the end of the Middle Ages to the modern period. Here are a few of them:

Allen, S.J., and Emilie Amt. The Crusades: A Reader. 2nd ed. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2014.

Munholland, Kim. “Michaud’s History of the Crusades and the French Crusade in Algeria under Louis-Philippe.” In The Popularization of Images: Visual Culture under the July Monarchy, edited by Petra ten-Doesschate Chu and Gabriel P. Weisberg, 144–65. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994.

"Not really.  The closest comparison you can probably make - labor pushing back against limiting wage increases - isn't really in the same realm and was a very different animal than perceived individual sacrifices.

But before getting into that, let's start with some of the reasons why rationing existed.  First, despite the United States being self sufficient throughout the war, its allies - particularly the United Kingdom - weren't, and that created shortfalls.  I don't have the numbers handy for how badly the UK needed American assistance with foodstuffs given the German blockade and closing off of the European market, but to give you a general idea of how bad it was even once the Battle of the Atlantic had largely been won, if you were in the United States you were allowed 6 ounces of meat and 1 pint of milk per day.  In the UK despite American help?  16 ounces of meat and 3 ounces of milk per *week*.  In short, without the United States, the United Kingdom would have starved.  In fact, it very nearly did during the Happy Times for the U-Boats, one reason why many of us really appreciated *Greyhound* as the first genuine portrayal of convoy escorting as it's one that's long overdue.

This created a strong recovery in the US economy in 1940-1941 as it became the arsenal of democracy, but the true boom times didn't happen until after Pearl Harbor.  At that point, with full employment reached fairly shortly thereafter, money started chasing goods and services in all sectors, and inflation outright skyrocketed.  Between December 1941 and March 1942, food prices alone went up 5 percent, and that was on top of the food and clothing index rising 20% over the full year preceding it.  But it wasn't just that.  One oft-forgotten bit of the early part of the war was that it wasn't just military materiel like natural rubber that had become rare; palm and many other common frying oils of the time had been lost when the Japanese conquered large parts of Asia, and the U-Boat campaign reigned utter havoc on the main supply of sugar to the United States from Cuba.

The disruptions and potential for massive profits to be made speculating on what would be in short supply next led to something quite familiar to us nowadays.  From *V Was For Victory*:

>A study of fourteen cities showed hoarding under way in many items: food (especially sugar, canned meats and vegetables, coffee, tea, spices, and olive oil), rubber goods (used automobile tires, gaskets for jars, garden hoses, golf balls, galoshes, girdles), household supplies (soap, linen, furniture, blankets), clothing (particularly men’s suits and shoes), and a miscellany of rifles and shotgun shells, typewriters, and paper clips.

This was not conducive to either price or labor stability for manufacturing, nor was it particularly helpful for the suddenly large purchases the United States military needed to make.  At that point, FDR called in then-Justice and former Senator Jimmy Byrnes to become what he called ""Assistant President"", initially in charge of drafting war powers legislation (while still on the Court!) and creating the first of several agencies, the War Production Board, that began to control allocation of goods, and then later after he resigned from the bench first the Office of Economic Stabilization (which controlled all pricing and labor costs) and then even more powers as head of the Office of War Mobilization (which outright controlled all labor allocation on top of his other powers).  In other words, Jimmy Byrnes was given control over the entire domestic portfolio with near dictatorial powers, with FDR only intervening occasionally as he concentrated on foreign policy and fighting the war.

The first thing that all the alphabet agencies accomplished was to implement rationing in April 1942 with War Ration Book #1, and unsurprisingly given the supply disruptions mentioned above the first things limited were sugar, butter and other fats, and red meat.  All meats and other dairy rationing came in 1943 - ~~incidentally, the phrase ""Mind your Ps & Qs"" originated from this period when they stood for ration (P)oints and food (Q)uantities~~ (edit: source was apparently wrong on this) - and while there was occasional grumbling about how much you could buy, the difference was that because of rationing everything indeed remained available on shelves provided that you indeed had coupons - and for once, most people could afford them.  (One thing that reflects this is that meat consumption in the United States *rose* 1/3 between the start and end of the war despite rationing, a sign of just how thorough the recovery had spread through all economic stratas.)

This dovetailed with the massive effort made between government and the private sector to promote the efficacy and importance of rationing; this is where basic food groups developed for what was considered basic nutritional needs, where alternates were suggested for recipes, reuse of products considered, and where advertisements in magazines urged housewives to do their share with every last meal preparation.  The social pressure to conform was immense, but it wasn't just that; as government issued coupons, it now became a crime to misuse them, something that even Justice William O. Douglas - later known for often obstinate protest against potential government overreach on civil liberties - authored a 1946 opinion in *Davis v. United States* upholding the conviction of someone who had hoarded hundred of gasoline ration coupons for resale precisely because they were government issued.

The other aspect to this time period that's important to remember is just how much the economy boomed as well.  Between 1938 and 1942 average family income had gone up anywhere between 15% to an almost unbelievable 150% depending on region, and one reason there wasn't more grumbling was because even if you couldn't spend it on rationed items you could spend it on other things.  Country clubs, movie theaters, and racetracks boomed, housing prices went up 15-30% between 1941 and 1943 and then another 10-30% on top of that by 1944, and even despite all the spending household liquid assets went from $50 billion in 1941 to an astounding $140 billion by the end of 1944.  In other words, a rising tide carried everyone, and it was one reason why there was very little protest on the home front.

But if you wanted to take a few risks, you could indeed get black market rationed items.  Again from *V Was For Victory*:

>It was no problem to obtain scarce and rationed goods at a price in the black markets. Boneless ham in Washington, D.C. sold on the black market for $1.25 a pound, almost twice its legal ceiling price. With patience, a buyer could find nylon hose in most cities for five dollars a pair. In Philadelphia, without recourse to rationing coupons, a determined customer could buy five-dollar shoes for about seven dollars. Those “willful violations,” as an official of the Office of Price Administration said, were hard to prevent, since they occurred largely
within regular retail channels on the basis of quiet collusion between the merchant and his patron.

So in other words, what price controls effectively did was to limit marginal demand on goods in short supply - except for those who really wanted to pay up for them.  This too was one reason why there was little protest.

But let's go back to the one exception: why wasn't labor happy?  Shortly after Pearl Harbor, it had signed an agreement to not strike for the duration of the war in exchange for a national board mediating wage increases.  By 1943, however, with the accession of Byrnes, the board was overruled and an executive order issued to halt everything potentially inflationary - wages, cost of goods, everything! - and rolled back to adjusted levels for 1942.  This - along with the fact that potential profits for war manufacturers had not been similarly capped - did not please the president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, who along with everyone else couldn't get in to see FDR (he referred all appointments to Byrnes) and was reduced to screaming in Byrnes' face and pounding on his desk.

FDR insisted that the CIO president apologize the next day, and he did, but almost no exceptions to the executive order were issued and inflation stopped for what were considered essential goods throughout 1945 (and in fairness to manufacturers, many did cost plus contracts that voluntarily capped their own profits.)  No one went on strike, and the war effort was unhindered.

This created a terrible problem for Truman in 1946 when he began to lift price controls (strikes and massive price increases resulted), but it also unintentionally ended up killing off Byrnes' chance at the Presidency since some of his strongest opposition in 1944 for the Vice Presidential slot came from a new enemy: labor.

So, no, the sacrifices made then were somewhat different than today.

>-- Ronald Reagan, talking on Labor Day, 1980

You might be a touch puzzled by the quote above, given just a year later Reagan was firing every one of the striking Air Traffic
Control workers (11,345 of them) in a public address on television.  If you characterize Reagan's position as ""pro-everything-union-related"" or
""anti-everything-union-related"" you get something of a paradox. He did have particular principles, and tried to articulate those
principles, but they have often been misunderstood, even at the historical moments the
events were happening.

...

Historians -- and the direct writings of Reagan himself -- are essentially unanimous that his change in politics from a New Dealer to
a free-market conservative (that led up to
his 1964 speech in support of Goldwater) came from his time working for General
Electric from 1954 to 1962. His primary job was hosting their Sunday television show. [You can watch an episode
of the show here which he also acted in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa5vihLT6UE), where his introduction includes the slogan:

>At General Electric, progress is our most important product.

Also as part of Reagan's job he was a ""goodwill ambassador"" and spent a quarter of his time touring in GE plants and giving speeches.

About a year in Reagan's work he still considered himself a Democrat; he was accompanied on his GE tours by press secretary George Dalen
and Reagan teased Dalen about his black suit marking him as a Republican, with Dalen replying that
Reagan had been ""taken in by Eleanor Roosevelt"".

In the meantime, though, part of Reagan's tour involved speechmaking to executives who were familiar with the ideas of the VP of GE (and union negotiator) Boulware, and Reagan
wanted to be familiar too so he could communicate at the same wavelength. Reagan started to find what he called
""concrete examples"" of ""collectivism that threatens to inundate what remains of our free economy.""

When Reagan left GE, he had what he self-described as a ""postgraduate course in
political science"" he no longer was. He soaked in GE's messages, including the GE vice president Boulware during his
negotations with labor (Boulware's philosophies of the free market where sometimes termed Boulwarism). 

To give an example of the sort of reading Reagan was doing, consider Lewis Haney’s book _How You Really Earn Your Living_ and Henry Hazlitt's
_Economics in One Lesson_, the latter being nearly a foundational text for late-20th-century free market thinkers.  They make an argument regarding the ""booms and busts"" of business:

>America under free enterprise has been a land of surplus.

and the driver of government deficit is war, but deficits under war can simply be corrected after war is over:

>... for if we assume that there is any advantage in a budget deficit, then precisely the same budget deficit could be maintained as before by simply reducing taxes by the amount previously spent in supporting the wartime army.

This essentially formed the idea (for Reagan) that deficits are acceptable for national defense but should be avoided otherwise, that is, with social programs.

In the middle of Reagan's work with GE, he became president of the Screen Actor's Guild for a brief term from 1959 to 1960 (as opposed to his longer SAG presidency held from 1947 to 1952).
The big problem brewing at the time was a possible strike against movie producers for movies being shown on television without residuals being
paid out. Simultaneous to all this, GE had their own strike to worry about, as members of the International Union of Electricians were themselves
set to strike. So GE found themselves in the awkward scenario of their goodwill spokesperson urging a strike in one group while simultaneously
trying to quell a strike amongst themselves.

(There is incidentally some grumbling that the final deal between SAG and the producers gave too much away, essentially trading away residuals
for movies produced before 1960 for a lump sum, but this seems to have been normal negotiation-trading as opposed to bending too quickly for a deal.)

Reagan registered no opinion on IUE's scenario, and Reagan was taken off his plant-speech tour while the IUE negotiations were getting close to start. This wasn't his choice but wasn't really Boulware's either,
as having a company spokesman (Reagan) talking with workers could be considered an unfair labor practice, as it would constitute a secondary
negotiating representative. Roughly the same time as this there was a National Labor Relations Board case (Herman Sausage) that noted
it an unfair practice to have a campaign not only during negotiations but also beforehand.

So paradox #1 (SAG union vs. IUE union negotiations happening simultaneously) is resolved that Reagan simply couldn't offer comment in the IUE case because as a company representative it
would violate labor practice.

...

Paradox #2 happened when he was governor of California. In 1968 he signed the Meyers Milias Brown Act – which gave public employees collective bargaining rights. This was far
from an anti-labor stance -- it actually greatly increased the number of unions in California.

On the other hand, during the exact same time, there was the Delano grape strike. This was kicked off when a thousand Filipino farm workers
started a strike against grape growers, Mexican workers were hired as replacement workers, and Cesar Chavez's union was enlisted to helped 
organize the Mexican workers to join the strike as well. At the same time, Reagan ate a grape on TV and stated ""there is no strike"" and called what happened an ""illegal and
immoral maneuver"". Specifically, Reagan claimed that some of the workers as part of the protest were pressured by Chavez's union, and that

>You organize a union by going to the workers themselves, and they choose voluntarily the organization they want, the group they want to belong to that they believe will represent them in securing the best in wages and working conditions. Cesar Chavez has sought to go over the heads of the workers to management ...

I'm going to pass over if Reagan's characterization was fair -- the important point here is that by Reagan's principles, the union wasn't operating above board, and he still considered himself a union supporter. (It should be noted that the efforts on Chavez and the United Farmer Workers' part eventually led to the signing of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975, considered a triumph by labor.)

...

For the third paradox, we can refer to the Solidarity movement in Poland, where workers banded a million-strong in opposition to the Soviet government, demanding better working conditions. This led to a Soviet crackdown and Reagan's speech.

Perhaps you might say ah-ha, that's simply self-serving as opposition to communism considering what happened the next year: the PATCO strike. The strike was actually in regard to a long-bubbling problem with Air Traffic Control workers (all employees of the federal government) and there was potential for the strike to happen during Carter's rather than Reagan's administration. The PATCO strike essentially was around a wage increase of $10,000 and a shorter workweek, but the union had a serious problem: all employees were required to sign an oath that they wouldn't strike. That is, by definition, a strike would be breaking the law. However, there was so little progress on PATCO demands that a strike was nonetheless voted for as an act of ""civil disobedience"".

Reagan didn't blink: he announced that every air traffic controller had 48 hours to return to work or be fired. This was by far the most public shutdown a union had seen for many years, and it emboldened conservatives -- George Will actually called it the day liberalism died.

However, in the speech Reagan gave, he added himself text that he made very clear his standpoint: he was doing his act because a strike against the government was illegal, and that he was formerly SAG president, and he still fully supported the right to strike against private companies. This argument still has logical issues (the Poland worker strike, after all, was also technically against the government) but at least, it meant in his mind there was no contradiction, and according to his diary entries at the time he was genuinely furious about the illegality of the strike.

There was some pressure in Reagan's government to allow some of the fired workers to regain their jobs due to the difficulty of all the retraining required, although this never happened. At the least, the workers that did return were given significant wage increases (11.6%/year versus 4.8%/year for other federal workers), a point the Reagan administration raised against the claim they were anti-Union. 

Whatever Reagan's intention, that vast scope of Reagan's firing gave the energy to anti-union forces for many years after in all circumstances, public and private. Still, it really seemed from all evidence Reagan's issue was more directed. His action was not spur of the moment. Reagan writing in May 25, 1977:

>A strike of pub. emps. manifests nothing less than an intent on their part to prevent or obstruct the operations of govt. until their demands are satisfied. Such action looking toward the paralysis of govt. by those who have sworn to support it is unthinkable & intolerable.

While those were written in a Reagan essay, they were not his words. He was quoting the words of FDR.

"This is all great reading, but, sorry, I'm a bit lost.  I've read all 4 parts of your answer (which is fascinating and refreshing to read something about which someone has so much passion), but I don't see in your posts an answer to what I thought was OP's primary questions: why would a medical professional describe the heart in that way when know it *can't* be how it actually looked during the autopsy?  Not a drop of blood?  What's going on with that?

Even during the period in question, I would assume that an autopsy is still a professional process with the main purpose of gathering and transferring information about the patient (and medical knowledge more generally) so why does the doctor performing it describe huge exaggerations or make completely false claims (no blood?) and in such, I guess, *cheeky* terms?

The topics you explain are very interesting, but I'm not seeing the connection to the question.  I'm probably missing it, so I'm not saying it's not there.  I just don't see it."
"As far as I am aware, there was little dispute among the founders about giving the new federal government power over the post office. Even the early, vastly smaller federal government set up by the Articles of Confederation gave the federal government power to set up a post office (which it initially did in 1782, more than a decade before the Constitution was ratified and took effect). 


There is one interesting letter from John Jay (first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court) to George Washington, in which they appear to be already assuming agreement on the power the federal government will have to set up a post office, but debating where it will sit *within* the federal government. Jay argues to Washington that where the post office under the articles of confederation was largely run by “committee” without executive oversight, the new constitutionally-authorized post office should be more strongly controlled by the Executive (meaning the President). https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_7s2.html"

">I was originally going to make a joke about how if you're comparing density of historical scholarship on a subject, ancient Rome is about as useful a metric as the tanks of World War II.

I wanted to add on to this by pointing out how much of what ""we know"" about Rome is not an artefact of the nature of the source record, it is the artefact of painstaking historical research done over centuries. In a recent thread I talked about the triumph, which is something that everybody ""knows"" about Rome and is frequently in movies, TV shows, artistic recreations, etc. But it is never actually described--the recreation of it comes from gathering together passing references to it from a large number of sources. Or you can think of the Roman Forum, which also does not have a single, unified ancient description but we can recreate with extreme accuracy based on scholarly efforts. Meanwhile, there are multiple independent description of Karakorum, but you will have a bit of a job if you want to find something like [this](http://www.legionxxiv.org/lrgforumplan/lrgforumplan.jpg)."
"My experience is with Egyptian dance, but I suggest looking into the research by Sahra C. Kent (Sahra Saeeda) and Heather Ward (Nisaa of St. Louis). Sahra does a seminar series called Journey Through Egypt in which she discusses Egyptian culture and dance and how dance has evolved from local social dance to stage performance, and Heather Ward is the author of  *Egyptian Belly Dance in Transition: The Raqs Sharqi Revolution, 1890-1930.*

Modern Egyptian belly dance has evolved from the dances of the Awalim ( female singers, dancers, musicians who performed for the lower and middle classes in private residences) and Ghawazee, dancers who performed for the rural populations in public. Awalim, while being of a similar social class to the Ghawazee, were held in higher esteem because they performed in private, higher class residences, whereas Ghawazee performed in public.

In the 1830s, King Muhammad Ali banned public performances by these two groups, as well as prostitution in urban areas, and when they were able to return decades later, the lines between the two blurred.

In the 1890s, the new style *raqs sharqi* (what we know as belly dance) developed with the advent of entertainment halls.

Costuming and movement styles would evolve with influences from the film industry and western influences such as ballet. I'm sure Mahmoud Reda, one of the founders of the Reda Dance Troupe, had a large influence on the evolution of this movement as he studied multiple forms of dance, including ballet, and trained many dancers over the course of his life. According to Nada El Masriya, there isn't a professional belly dancer in Egypt who hasn't taken at least some foundational ballet. You can see it in the terminology and movement vocabulary currently taught.

I would also say that the Reda Troupe had a large hand in bringing the dance styles to the rest of the world, via the Reda Troupe and his and Farida Fahmy's involvement in the Egyptian film industry, which featured a lot of oriental dancers, such as Tahiya Carioca, Samia Gamal, Soheir Zaki, and Nagwa Fouad.

You have to understand though, that Egypt has a very complicated relationship with its native music and dance forms. They aren't exactly viewed as high art by many people. And dancers can often be viewed as ""loose women."" Like, they may want a dancer at their wedding, celebration, etc, but they would never want their daughter to become a dancer. And even professional dancers (native, not western ones) will be sure to distance themselves from the Awalim and Ghawazee traditions because of stigma.

I won't speak about Orientalism, as I haven't done a ton of research into that area at this time.

It is important to note that homestyle dance and stage performance are very different. While they share some movement vocabulary, belly dance for the stage, depending on the style, does tend to be more seductive, because you are portraying a sort of fantasy, or playing a character. But the seductive nature of it will vary depending on your audience.

I am an Egyptian style dancer who has been studying for the last 8 years with various native Egyptian and Western teachers, and I have taken the first two levels of Sahra C. Kent's JtE series and have sat in lectures by Heather Ward."
"Were those glass mirrors, or highly-polished metal?"
"Part 2

It’s important to pause here and give a quick note of what made people lose a taste for small game and specifically raccoon. There were 3 main factors: mass urbanization, the Green Revolution, and a subsequent change in hunting patterns among Americans.
 
Let’s begin in 1920 as that is when the question asks about raccoon in American cuisine. The 1920 census places approximately one half of individuals [in rural areas](https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/geography/urban_and_rural_areas.html#:~:text=%22Urban%22%20was%20defined%20as%20including,population%20was%20defined%20as%20urban.). There were also relatively few laws governing conservation of natural resources, with the National parks Service [only being founded in 1916](https://www.nps.gov/articles/quick-nps-history.htm). Before then there was an understanding that America was a land of bountiful wealth, and that included its natural resources and animals. Raccoons were often specifically targeted to the point that a hunting tradition developed known as “cooning” and dog breeds known as “coonhounds” were bread specifically to hunt raccoons and other small game such as opossums. During this point in time many Americans engaged in subsistence hunting, where a family would hunt wild animals as a food source. Subsistence hunting was just one of the options within the system to feed the family and often came secondary to farming, gardening, gathering, or purchasing the primary bulk of the family’s meals. Within sustenance hunting anything that walks, crawls, swims, flies, hops or slithers is considered fair game, and can be killed, captured or trapped because it goes well in stew (or gumbo). This brought raccoon to the family table. It was one of many creatures that a rural family could prepare, cook, and eat in the same day, and existed across virtually all of North America. Furthermore it was legally a varmint in many areas, and local laws encouraged wide scale extinction of the raccoon for its effect on crops and livestock, similar to the organized attempts to remove the [grey wolf]( https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/gray_wolves/).
 
Over the decades as the population urbanized there was less regular access to wild game. Many of the traditional avenues to hunt were cut off and it was more difficult to access hunting areas on a daily basis within urban centers. there also existed a different cultural consciousness in where food comes from. Most urbanites did not, and still do not, produce the majority of their own food. While urban gardening has seen massive surges, [such as during World War Two with victory gardens](https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/artworks/victory-garden/), these systems were intended to supplement purchased, often heavily processed, food rather than take over as a primary method of food production. There have also been subsequently less hunters in urban areas per-capita then in rural areas where ready access and a cultural consciousness of self-reliance were much more present. Further, with the advent of the Green Revolution, the concept of food consumption changed radically."
"> Subsistence riots were generally based on the notion that there was a fair price for grain, and that it was the responsibility of the king (and his proxies) to enforce that fair price. This wasn't incorrect: there was no free market in grain in the early modern period (experiments in free trade e.g. in 1774-75 didn't end well), 

Fascinating. I never heard about that before.

Can you go into details? Why were prices fixed, how well did it work (I assume ""not very""), why didn't liberalization end well?"
"The idea of [""Nacirema""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacirema), that archaeologists and anthropologists just love interpreting practical things as ritual and in mystical ways, is one that emerged as a self critique in the disciplines and has captured the wider public (I think particularly with social media, although as your question demonstrates not exclusively with it). It makes sense why it is appealing, there is an irresistible ""snobs vs slobs"" aspect to a bunch of out of touch, ivory tower eggheads debating over what arcane ritual function a particular vessel has before some salt of the earth type tells them it's a toilet. Also while it feels a bit dramatic to talk about ""well funded disinformation campaigns"" when discussing the Akkadians, it is certainly worth noting that the many of the purportedly educational television networks in the United States have decided to dedicate their resources ([and celebrity appearances](https://www.history.com/shows/the-unxplained)) to informing their viewers that archaeologists don't want you to know about the aliens. By which I mean that there is a certain ambient dislike of archaeologists in the culture, and that this critique rides in its wake.

Which is not to say the critique has no validity, saying something is ""ritual"" is a bit of a thought terminating cliche. Saying something had a ritual function essentially means that its function was highly idiosyncratic and its form was leaden with meaning such that it is difficult, if not impossible, to use it to interpret its function. It is also very easy to say something has a ""ritual function"" because, well, anything might. All this said, one of the reasons that ""ritual"" is a common interpretation is because ""ritual"" objects are extremely common in human society, and particularly in the sorts of objects and structures that remain for archaeologists to find. For example, in practically every town in Europe there is one building that is older than everything else, has a highly distinct architectural form and decorative elaboration, is in a central location and set off from every other building: the church. Likewise no matter how secular and demystified society becomes, it is hard to deny that the single most set apart day of the year is December 25. And of course just because something is ""ritual"" does not mean there is not a multiplicity of meanings: think Halloween, Mardi Gras and St. Patrick's Day as being religious days in which common custom is to wear unusual, distinctive attire and take part in ritual behaviors distinctive to those days, while *also* being just a bit of fun. If ritual is common in anthropological and archaeological interpretation, that is because it is common in human society and practice.

Now to actually get close to answering your question, it is less that there are direct ""it's a toilet"" moments than there are cases where interpretation is unclear and ""ritual"" is one of the plausible interpretations. For example, in Iron Age and Roman northwest Europe a somewhat common feature is an underground cellar like structure that varies in particularity of construction and name being called ""souterrain"" or ""fougou"". And there is debate about what these are: are the simple storage cellars? Are they places of concealment and refuge? Are they, indeed, connected to some sort of ritual connected to chthonic forces that we are unaware of? You pays your money and you takes your choice. Likewise the cave paintings of the European Ice Age have been interpreted as part of a quasi-shamanic ritual of spiritual journey or as a historical record of deeds and hunts (which is arguably a kind of ritual, but leaving that aside).

These sorts of debates can have higher stakes as well: a perennially popular debate is whether the so-called Minoan civilization was unusually peaceful and free of strife (""Minoan flower people"" as a well known article dubbed it). One arguing this position--for which there is real support--has to explain away the presence of weapons, and ""ritual"" is invoked here. There is absolutely nothing absurd about this, sacrifices are real, important social phenomena and they require tools. But there could also be a whiff of Nacirema about this.

Interpretations can also change due to increasing information. For example, [one story that has gone around the news recently](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/sacred-pool-of-baal-a-reinterpretation-of-the-kothon-at-motya/329646E6561765FD30A9D6EC5FD5B6CB) involves a large pool in the Phoenician site of Motya, in Sicily. This pool has often been interpreted as a harbor because it somewhat resembles a harbor structure from Carthage, however recent excavations have pointed towards its surroundings being very temple-heavy and that it was not, in fact, connected to the open sea, leading to the conclusion that it was (wait for it) a sacred space of ritual activity. It is, in fact, a two way street.

This is all a way of saying that there are certainly cases where the term ""ritual"" is used a bit loosely, but it tends to be when the function and context are quite vague and up for debate, and also that interpretation is often good and correct."

"To add on with a different field. I can only answer for neuropsychology, but Alexander Luria, Lee Vygotsky, and others in their circle were among the greatest minds in all of psychology. Ever. Their work on the relationship between social experience and brain development is still being studied and considered, not just by educators who are interested in improving learning, but by those interested in traumatic brain injury. Although Vygotsky had a decent correspondence with Western researchers like Jean Piaget, he died in his mid 30s (which keeps me up at night given that I'm entering my mid 30s and I've done nothing in comparison to that man), and anyway, the Vygotsky-Luria circle didn't influence Western thought as much as they deserved to for some time. 

Nowadays, Vygotsky is renowned amongst educators (e.g. he invented the concept of the Zone of proximal development) and Luria is renowned amongst neuropsychologists (e.g his work relating specific types of brain injury to specific clusters of neuroses have the field a framework from which to think about how a single damage altered the entire system). 

The Soviet psychologists were comparable to the German, American, and Austrian psychologists in terms of a culture of geniuses. Sometimes, I consider what other geniuses we missed out on. I'm sure there are old books that are rotting away that were rarely seen by Western eyes just because they weren't published at the right time. I'm grateful for the ones I know. Because they changed my life during my PhD. Especially Luria. But I am certain there were others who could inform me still. "

When the white residents of the mining community saw these white kids get off the train and go to live with the Mexican families, they LOST. THEIR. MINDS. Something akin to a lynch mob formed that evening, and the white residents went house to house, armed, and took the white children out of the Mexican homes. At one point, this white mob held the priests and nuns responsible for the adoption placements at gunpoint, and demanded the names of all the families that had taken custody of these ""white"" children.

"Since your question has already been answered from a security standpoint, I will try to handle it from a cultural one. 

I remember learning that when Washington became president, there was a good amount of debate and nervousness among American officials, as a democracy had not been implemented on such a scale since the Roman Republic, and individuals held varying opinions on how the president should act and what level of professionalism and separation from the people he should hold.

You must remember that since there was no precedent set, Washington had an enormous amount of pressure on him. He likely realized that future presidents would emulate his style of ruling and his approach to the balance of power, particularly when it came to the left vs right wing debate. This is also the reason why he often took advice from both Jefferson (a left-wing individual) and Hamilton (a right-wing one), and both of which were constantly trying to sway Washington to their side. 

But I digress. Washington eventually decided that the best decision was to be less formal and regally dressed than a monarch, but moreso in both regard than the average citizen. **So, no, there was no enormous cultural ""barrier"" that separated you from the President as it would from, say, the Holy Roman Emperor, and you would indeed be permitted to speak with Washington.**

However, George Washington stopped being president in 1797, and was succeeded by Adams; your question asks specifically for 1798. I cannot speak for Adams, however I am willing to assume that his approach was not particularly unlike Washington's, especially given that the White House remained open to the public for decades after that. 

In fact, Lincoln even has a quote about the sheer number of citizens that came to visit him in the White House:

""For myself, I feel—though the tax on my time is heavy—that no hours of my day are better enjoyed than those which thus bring me again within the direct contact and atmosphere of the average of our whole people."" (Source: www.whitehousehistory.org/abraham-lincolns-white-house )

"> It's slow to speak, due to all of the compound words, and very slow to write due to all the diacritical marks. It is *easier* to just communicate in English, so people are doing so, and then the language slowly dies.

While I believe it might be difficult to write, I sincerely doubt Navajo is especially difficult or slow to speak _for a native speaker._ The human cognitive capacity for language is subject to a number of constraints such that [all human languages communicate information at the same rate.](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaaw2594)

Navajo speakers _do_ speak slower than English speakers, from what I know, but Navajo sentences are much more information-dense (notably, ""I am in the middle of driving a car into a ditch and getting it stuck"" is a single word, about 6-8 syllables long, in Navajo, IIRC), so the actual information comes out at the same rate.

Edit:

I do understand that it may be more ""difficult"" in another sense to speak Navajo - the language has few monolingual speakers, and speaking two languages is harder than speaking one. Many minority languages run into the problem of young people not wanting to bother with their parents' language, when they can just use the predominant language around them for everything of consequence."

in particular from a conversation; for example, ""you know"" being a check with someone listening that they do, in fact, know, and that they should give some sort of negative signal if the conversation is off track. (By a recent study, discourse markers also tend to be more common amongst women and younger people; in other words, even within a country, filler words may different by age or gender.)

The first place we'd like to turn for historical filler words is literature; unfortunately, while we have some very old uses of filler words, we don't have them being attempted in any ""authentic"" way. It wasn't really until the 19th century that authors tried to go full naturalist with
filler words as ""interruptions"", but to lay down very old examples first, here's ""hem"" in 
1526 from John Skelton:

>Hem, syr yet beware of Had I wyste!

""Hum"" appears in Shakespeare (Merry Wives of Windsor).

>Hum: ha? Is this a vision?

Jumping to the 19th century, Charles Dickens uses both words in the filler sense, in Little Dorrit:

>I have a -- hum -- a spirit, sir, that will not endure it.

and elsewhere in the same work:

>Gardens are -- hem -- are not accessible to me.

Rather more elaborately, here's an 1853 clip from Robert Surtees's novel Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour:

>'Ha--he--hum,' says Lord Scamperdale.

>'Meet at the Court,' mumbled his lordship--'meet at the court--ha--he--ha--hum--no; got no foxes.'

Now, the problem for those hopeful at discovering old, new filler words: ""haw"" when given verbally was just ""uh"", and ""hum"" was just ""um""; the spelling simply differed.

""He"" is perhaps the more interesting of those and seems to have been an ""eh"". ""Eh"" shows up that way elsewhere; [here's a clip from 1876](https://books.google.com/books?id=oUxHAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA57):

>""To you? oh, ah, eh -- twice their value, my good Fraulein Elsa.""

and [one from 1885](https://books.google.com/books?id=gCVJAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA308):

>Eh, eh, eh, Freule? And how is it with the town councillor, and with his daughter, and with you all, eh, eh, eh? Fine seasonable weather;
not to warm, though, eh, eh? And what is the latest news in the town, eh?

By the end of the 19th century, the ""eh"" sound seems to be mostly relegated to the function above: forming transitions in the same manner as a discourse marker, as opposed to a filled pause. ""Eh"" is alive and well in parts of eastern Canada, but more as a discourse marker (or indicating a question).

...

So, if ""eh"" used to be an actual filled pause, as opposed to a discourse marker, ​wouldn't it be nice if we could hear it that way?

While we have [a recording all the way back in 1860](https://youtu.be/75UrxueiP-4?t=2026), ""unfortunately"" it is reciting lines from the play *Aminta* so it doesn't include filler words. (Also, it's in Italian, and I've been sticking with English.) However!--

One of the oldest recordings we have on phonograph is from Thomas Edison himself, on a recording discovered at the Edison National Historic Site in 1995; inside, was a paper:

>Thomas A. Edison talking from N.Y. to Buffalo Buffalo to Chicago Etc. Etc. Made in 1888

[Here is the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3ajRIMXgFA). You may notice right off the start the word ""uh"" -- this
is the currect record for earliest ""filler word"" we have recorded.

>Uh, now, Mr. Blaine, as you’ve been nearly around the world, I’ll take you around the world on the phonograph. I’ll not charge you anything. 

So, perhaps it is not surprising -- nor exciting for this particular question -- that Edison uses the word ""uh"". But check out the
next part of the recording (and note the Youtube transcriber misses this word, but it is clear once you hear it!)

>I’ll take you on a steamer, **eh**, a Cunard steamer to Liverpool, and from Liverpool to London, from London on the London & Brighton Railroad to Brighton, and from Brighton we’ll go on those little two-cent steamers across the English Channel to Calais.

Technically, you can think of the ""eh"" still feels a bit like a section transition, but it definitely occurs in the middle of a sentence rather than at the end. Admittedly, this isn't as exciting as you might hope for? ... we essentially have ""eh"" transition from a more general filled pause to a discourse marker. But perhaps, given the history of English over the centuries, it's just as interesting when we find something that's stable as opposed to something that changes.

"For the purposes of the question, is there not an actual point in it, though? If, for example, Scandinavia or Ukraine was 30% non-“white” (by our modern conception of whiteness, let’s say) having an all-white cast would be far less accurate than if it were 1% all-white. 

You explained how there were undoubtedly non-white people during the movie’s setting, but I’m still a bit unsure what that actually means. Does it mean that cities like Kyiv would have enclaves of Arab, North African, and Byzantine merchants or missionaries who came on short-term stays? Or, does it mean that those cities had large Arab or North African populations who were permanent, culturally integrated, and regularly intermarrying with the local populations? Please correct me if I’m wrong, but your initial answer seems to imply the former, rather than the latter. If so, then Scandinavia and Ukraine of the 9th century (the setting of the movie) doesn’t strike me as being a particularly diverse or multicultural place at all - at least not in our conception of diverse in the vein of modern day US, UK, or Singapore. Especially given  that no scenes in the movie take place in any large cities or commercial centers, it seems like inclusion of non-white characters would be just as notable as their exclusion?"

"Good morning everyone, back for some additional info. 

One thing I would like to *very* briefly sketch out as an add on to this answer from yesterday is around the absolute confusion in what is now Ukraine from 1917 to 1921, because how one reads this history feeds a lot into interpretations of the current politics. 

 - Early 1917: After the February 1917 Revolution, the Central Council (or Central Rada) is formed in Kyiv and chaired by Mykhailo Hrushevsky. It forms the Ukrainian People's Republic (or Ukrainian National Republic, these are both translations of the same term), which throughout 1917 works to build national Ukrainian institutions but is still technically autonomous in Russia. It [claims](https://geomap.com.ua/images/uh10b/uh10_16_files/image004.jpg) most of modern-day Ukraine, not interestingly enough Crimea or parts of eastern Ukraine, but effectively controls central Ukraine.

 - November 1917: the Bolsheviks overthrow the Provisional Government and gain power in Russia. They want to station Red Guards in Ukraine, and the Central Rada says no, so the Bolsheviks invade in December (and reach Kyiv by January 1918). 

 - January 1918: all this time World War I is still going on, and Russia (and Ukraine) are still fighting. Negotiations between the Bolsheviks and the Central Powers at Brest Litovsk break down and an offensive is launched, with most of Ukraine now occupied by the Central Powers. The Central Rada declares independence and enters into relations with Germany and Austia-Hungary, but the latter basically occupy most of the country. Bolshevik control persists in the east around Kharkhiv.

 - April 1918: A coup is launched against the Central Rada and Pavlo Skoropadsky gains control as Hetman, with German and Austrian support. This government is pretty unpopular.

 - November 1918: With the First World War armistice, German and Austrian troops withdraw from Ukraine. The Directory overthrows Skoropadsky and the Hetmanate, and the Ukrainian People's Republic is back, first under Volodymyr Vynnychenko, then Symon Petliura. But Bolshevik troops also use the opportunity to advance from Kharkhiv, and seize Kyiv again in February 1919. The Republic bases itself in Vinnitsya.Meanwhile the Ukrainians in Galicia declare the West Ukrainian People's Republic, and pretty much immediately begin fighting with Poles - Lviv is Polish-held and besieged by Ukrainians, until the French-led Blue Army arrives and tilts the balance in favor of Poland in March 1919. 

 - 1919-1920 Most of Ukraine is consumed by the Russian Civil War, which also sees White Russian Armies moving across, as well as Bolsheviks, French interventionist forces, and Nestor Makhno's Anarchists. This is a giant bloody mess. Pretty much everyone occupies Kyiv at some point. 

 - April 1920: the Ukrainian People's Republic joins an alliance with Poland and a joint campaign is launched, capturing Kyiv. This is defeated and a Bolshevik offensive reaches Warsaw, which is also defeated at the least minute. A ceasefire is signed in October 1920 and the Treaty of Riga in March 1921. Basically Poland gets Galicia and Volhynia and the Bolsheviks get the rest, and what's left of the Ukrainian People's Republic is interned and disarmed in Poland.

"I hesitate to divulge into the details of the rationale as not to give it power and in fear of sounding sympathetic to a view I believe abhorrent. However, the question can be answered either in the general, discussing the historical fringe individuals who forbid education for women, or by limiting the scope to talk about Taliban. As it is clear that OP was referencing Taliban in their question or at least had them in mind, I elect to do the latter.

To the best of my knowledge, the leaders of Taliban never dared claim that the very concept of woman education is haram. As the view which forbids women education is rejected by all major sects, it is hard to amass a religious following while adopting it. To the best of my knowledge, Taliban previously claimed that the ban is temporary and out of necessity. Sources which list the exact reasons why are hard to come by since the heads of Taliban would rarely ever give detailed theological lectures in their public appearances, but I know of at least two claims both by second-hand sources.

First, in “The Taliban: War, Religion, and the New Order in Afghanistan” Peter Marsden emphasizes Taliban’s claim of the ban being temporary. According to him, their reasoning was that educational facilities and infrastructure needs to be revamped as to allow segregated schooling between the genders. As the reader could easily guess, the rationale for segregation was to avoid inhabiting an environment were extra-marital relationships could foster. Segregation here likely includes disallowing cross-gender instruction as well, a male teacher would not be allowed to instruct females  and vice versa. Women were still educated in fields in which their participation would further enhance society’s ability to be segregated at large. The example Marsden states in his book was Taliban allowing women in the medical field as to ensure that female patients would not be attended by male doctors. Other fields were also permitted in seeking the same goal. 

Peter hints at an answer to a question another poster here posed: Why only women? If it was truly only a matter of segregation, then solely allowing women education and prohibiting men's would achieve the same goal right? Well, this is the point were I personally would reference the parts in my original post about the patriarchy and abusing text to further personal agendas. If one were to insist on a direct answer from Taliban, however, then the testimonies of Faiz AlKandri might be the closest we have. 

Faiz is a Kuwaiti citizen who was a Guantanamo Bay extrajudicial detainee for over a decade, only released in 2016. His case remains controversial as he maintained his innocence during his stay and was determined by a Joint Review Task Force to be an individual “too innocent to charge but too dangerous to release”. Although Faiz strongly denies any Taliban affiliation, nor was charged under that claim, he is still largely thought to be a Taliban apologize/sympathizer.  I believe this introduction necessary for each reader to decide the validity of any given claims by this source. I will leave discussing the details of his case to someone more specialized in law as I am only here to discuss the theological arguments related to OP’s question.

In his book “AlBala’ AlShadeed wa AlMelaad AlMajeed” subtitled “Fourteen Years in Guantanamo” as well as in his personal testimonies, Faiz details many conversations with Taliban heads which he had while in Guantanamo. When the subject of women education was brought up, Faiz claims certain Taliban heads strongly denied forbidding it religiously, adding that they actually believe islam to support women education. According to them, they were merely faced with limited fundings insufficient to educate more than a fraction of the men, women, boys, and girls in school age. Faced with this situation, they claim, the decision was made to provide education to a “sizable portion” of the male population first since males are culturally the heads of households and charged of providing for entire families. 

Though he does not mention it by name, Faiz’ second-hand justification seems to reference the concept of Nafaqah in islamic law. Under most, if not all, islamic schools of thoughts, there is a detailed grid of mandatory financial support. If an individual is financially capable of fulfilling their outward financial support, they are obliged to do so. The amount of financial support is explicitly not specified, but left to the societal and temporal definition of “sufficient”. Many definitions under islamic law are treated this way, and there are detailed processes for picking jury members who can work to extract the current societal definition of such concepts when one is needed in a court ruled by islamic law. But I digress. In the grid of Nafaqah, both parents are mandated to provide financially for their children, and so are children mandated to provide for their parents later in life. However, while a husband is obliged to support his wife financially, the wife is only encouraged but not obliged to support the husband financially directly. It bears mention that every single person is connected to this societal grid by giving or receiving Zakat (annual taxation given to the poor) even if they had no personal connections to speak of. 

In a perfect Nafaqah grid, Taliban would argue, the money obtained by men with education would trickle down to all members of society and individual families via mandatory Nafaqah. However, suppose a portion of education, and therefore money, was reserved for women before that “sizable portion” of the male population receives and education. Under that assumption, they claim, a perfect trickle-down could not be mandated as women are not obliged to give Nafaqah to their husbands. 

Now that I have endured the entirely uncomfortable task of twice relaying how Taliban heads explain their actions, it would be informative to analyze how their arguments hold under the scrutiny of islamic law. The Taliban argument seems predicated on five axioms: 

    1. There is a severe limitation of available spots in schools. 
    2. That shortage cannot be remedied any time soon. 
    3. Education can be fully equated with access to money.
    4. Handing out money to males, and only males, trickles down perfectly.
    5. Handing out money to females, and only females, leaves some members of society unsupported. 

There are more axioms than this, of course, but this level of simplicity is enough to find a glaring hole. In particular, axiom (5) ignores the fact that all members of society are connected to the Zakat network. Any member of society, male or female, would be eligible for Zakat if they are unable to support themselves financially and lack the necessary direct support nodes in the Nafaqah grid. With axiom (5) falsified, I argue that most islamic scholars would disagree with the conclusion pushed by Taliban. To that end, one can point to the fact that no similar conclusion was reached by the general body of islamic scholars in many islamic countries which went through comparably limiting circumstances. 

More can be said of course in refutation from an Islamic Law perspective. In particular, one can look at the example of The Year or Ramadah (Famine year) which befell the Hijaz area during the reign of the second islamic Kalifah Omar ibn AlKattab. Omar’s actions are considered to be of the second type of anecdotes discussed in my parent post, and is generally considered to be of greater legislating power among most Islamic Scholars especially Sunnis. During the Year of Ramadah, a great famine befell the Hijaz area which engulfs both Mecca and Medina. The actions of Omar ibn AlKattab during that year are closely studied in islamic law as to infer how, if at all, does islam extend a ruler’s jurisdictions during situations of crisis. Omar implemented many temporary decrees to ensure as equal a distribution of life-saving resources as possible during that year of famine. However, importantly, Omar kept everyone working equally by invoking the Zakat and Sadaqat parts of the Nafaqah grid instead. When needed, the distribution of resources came from the top-down. Interestingly, many scholars recently used these examples to support granting  local governments the power of distributing COVID vaccines to immunocompromised people before the general public. 

I will attempt to come back later to expand and answer questions."
"Not at all. If anything, Paul is famous for telling the same stories about compositions over and over again. The two most famous examples are the stories of ""Yesterday"" and ""Let It Be"", stories told ad nauseum.

The ""Blackbird""/civil rights story was first recorded within six months of its recording. There is a bootleg called ""No. 3 Abbey Road NW8"" which contains a recording of McCartney and foll artist Donovan jamming during downtime while producing the album *Postcard* by Mary Hopkin in November/December 1968. Paul plays part of ""Blackbird"" to Donovan and said he got the idea from the civil rights movement. Paul has consistently told the story since then. He really hasn't ever given any other explanation. 

He published a book of poetry in 2001 called *Blackbird Singing* which also contained reprinted lyrics from some of his songs. One of them was ""Blackbird"". On his press junket to promote the book, he retold the civil rights story consistently. These stories were far from the first, or last, time he has told the story.

What Paul *is* famous for is giving revisionist versions of stories and sticking to them. For instance, he steadfastly retells the story of ""Let It Be"" being inspired by a dream about his mother. However, the Beatles' roadie Mal Evans recalled multiple times that the dream was originally about him, and Paul only changed it later to be about his mother. In rehearsals for the *Let It Be* album that have leaked, Paul seems to confirm this version of events, with rehearsals using the original line ""Brother Malcolm comes to me"" and a conversation about ideas for the final verse have a mention from Paul of this line yet again. While a mild transgression (there's little doubt once Paul decided not to use Malcolm as a subject matter, the lyrics definitely *were* inspired by his mother), once Paul has his story, he usually sticks to it."
"Legally? Cleopatra wasn't a Roman citizen or a Latin.  Caesar couldn't legally marry her, or make Caesarion (also not a Roman citizen) his heir.

Personally?  I don't know.  There's a rumor somewhere that Antony ""married"" Cleopatra, but that marriage would have been not held valid in Rome, and the rumor was used to stoke anti-Antony fears by Octavian."

"That is the argument of Professor Blum (whom I quote), yes. According to him, Russia should not technically have had an automatic right to membership, as the seat of the Soviet Union should have lapsed into nonexistence with the end of the Soviet Union (as it was for the entire country, not just Russia within it) in accordance with the rules set out in 1947.

This would have then meant, according to Blum, that Russia would have had to go through the same membership process that, say, Tajikistan had to go through.

But as I said, these highly legalistic approaches to geopolitics only lead us so far. Russia took the seat, no one raised objections, and the UN went on."
Also: did this taboo extend outside of fiction and entertainment? Would people avoid saying the word in everyday life?
"I see where you're coming from, but I'm leery of attributing changes in something this big to the Industrial Revolution as a whole. There's no inherent reason for the Revolution to encourage parents to discourage childhood tears, or for it to make boys at school scornful of those in their student body who gave way over being sad about separation from home or being caned. I do think there's more to explore here, and it likely is related to the Industrial Revolution in some way because everything in the social sphere is connected, but ""the Industrial Revolution made people care more about science and reason, so men stopped being allowed to be emotional"" is too pat. Putting rationality on a pedestal was also done during the Enlightenment, but sensibility was still esteemeed then."

"> the Warhammer Fantasy setting of Games Workshop (which quite literally gave us the phrase ""grimdark"")

"To add, the additional brass band was simply 'as many brass players as you could find', which goes against the micromanaging that is typical of a skilled orchestrator. This supports the idea that the piece is a celebratory and festive piece. Similarly, the 'bells' part, which is either the churchbells of the venue or the orchestral tubular bells, is not notated, with players merely told to begin and end. This too is unusually un-micromanaged. It seems noise was all Tchaikovsky wanted.

I've played versions with silence (boo!), percussion (meh), laptop recordings of cannon (bad), but I've yet to play a version with real weapons., and probably with good reason - there's videos with real artillery and the sound obliterates the rest of the music. It simply is unmusical to feature such a loud contraption even against an orchestra. It would also be unsafe to do so inside, and orchestral music performed outside is typically unsatisfactory due to wind, lack of rebounding sound waves, audio dampening materials like vegetation..."
"You are referring to Article 1 paragraph 5 \[1\].

The answer is in The Projected Chemical Weapons Convention: A Guide to the Negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament \[2\]. Essentially it was a compromise to ensure that less-than-lethal effects were permitted to conduct internal civil control actions while maintaining adherence to the CWC.

It's helpful to keep in mind the context of these conventions, they are written as a committee by the states they will apply too. It is therefore in their best interests to ensure that they don't remove their ability to maintain effective control over their interests. In this situation we can clearly see the thought process in the quote below. The states in negotiation didn't want to reduce their ability to conduct harassing and control actions internally. 

>Irritants and herbicides are widely used for domestic purposes (e.g. riot control and agriculture). Consequently, questions such as whether to ban the use of these substances altogether or whether to prohibit their use for war purposes only, and how to include such a ban in the treaty without affecting their peaceful domestic use, have to be solved. If irritants and herbicides were covered by the definition of CW, the unconditional ban on the use of CW (not only in war) as contained in Article I of the rolling text would prohibit their employment altogether. Most delegations do not consider this a practical solution. Therefore, these chemicals may have to be handled outside the definition of CW, or the ban on use of  CW as contained in Article I may have to be modified to make the permitted use (however defined) of these substances possible.\[2\]

This was at odds to the desire to eliminate chemical warfare as even less-than-lethal chemicals could have longer term effects, and change the strategic risk profiles, as indicated below.

>It has also been argued that the use of irritants and herbicides in war might lead to the use of other chemicals and therefore to an escalation of chemical warfare. In addition, the massive use of herbicides can have long term effects on human health and the environment as the Indochina case may have shown. \[2\]

As a result:

>The use of irritants or herbicides would therefore be prohibited unless the quantities involved were strictly limited and justified for purposes permitted by the CWC. Riot control, for example, is to be explicitly permitted by a provision included in Article II of the rolling text\[2\]

This determination did not result in a free for all though. Restrictions and further agreements were established to ensure that signatory states could monitor and approve of harassing agents and irritants.

>Proposals have also been made to deal with irritants used for law enforcement and riot control purposes, and chemicals to enhance the effectiveness of chemical weapons.   
>  
>(a) It was proposed that irritants could be handled outside the definition of chemical weapons if this would result in better definition. It was also proposed that the term chemical weapon apply not to chemicals which are not ""super-toxic lethal"" or ""other lethal"" (as defined in the Annex on Chemicals) and which have been approved by the ""Conference of the States Parties"" (a body of the international organization to be established under the treaty) for use by a party for domestic law enforcement and riot control purposes. This would exclude approved irritants from the definition of CW, and therefore from the ban on use as provided for in Article I of the rolling text. \[2\]

For context I have a Masters in Military Technology Management and specialise in Artillery Systems. This is a bit out of my field but chemical weapons are strongly associated. I also apologise for my writing style, I haven't written academically for years, instead I've been writing briefs so my stile is more conversational than it should be.

"I'm sorry if I gave off the airs of a 2nd amendment zealot. I assure you that it was not intended as a political stance for, or against, gun regulation. Specifically, I never said that this (the quoted part) is a bad thing. The state by design has a monopoly on violence. Its capacity for this violence should be viable, precisely to maintain the peace. Just like laws depend on potential for punishment in order to ultimately have willful (and even motivated) compliance. Both capacities preferably are never, or very rarely, exercised.

To that end, all functional states have legally defined tiers of access to weaponry that go beyond simply regulating hazardous materials or machinery, and give full monopoly to the state regardless of its policy otherwise. Regarding firearms (which straddle all tiers of access, unlike, say, missile-armed jets), the military has full access, paramilitary agencies has access to firearms with slightly limited capabilities, law enforcement reduced capabilities, and private citizens the least capabilities.

So the ""edge"" against the populace is not necessarily malicious. It seems that at least to date, it (and hence gun regulation) is required for the modern state to function, and for due political, legal, and executive process to happen."
"Two things to make sense of the joke. First, Classical Athens did not have a police force or a justice department. The only way to get justice done was to submit a case to the jury courts and represent yourself. If Lysistratos failed to produce the change he owed to Philokleon, the only legal way to get the money out of him would be to take him to court. The suggestion is not so absurd in itself (though whether the jury would be amenable to a case for the loss of just 3 obols is another question; that much we can ascribe to comedic hyperbole).

Second, and much more important, is the fact that the main stereotype of Classical Athenians throughout Aristophanes' comedies was that they were obsessively litigious. The courts of Athens were almost constantly in session, having secured for themselves the right to judge even the cases of their subject allies; for many older Athenians, pay for jury service (at 3 obols per session) would have been a welcome source of income, which in turn generated a desire to see as many cases as possible. In the works of Aristophanes this becomes a defining trait of the city and its people. When Sokrates shows Strepsiades a map in the *Clouds*, he points to Athens, but Strepsiades doesn't believe it's really Athens because he can't see the jurors sitting in the courts. In the *Birds*, Athens is recognisable from afar by the sound of the jurors deliberating. The plot of the *Wasps* is that the old man Philokleon is *addicted to jury service*, and his son tries to cure him of his illness by imprisoning him in his house and entertaining him with a mock trial using kitchen utensils. It should surprise no one, then, that Philokleon would latch onto the slightest pretext to drag Lysistratos to court."

"They were especially at risk of being fired, but many did passive resistance, sometimes by protecting their students against deportation. The educational system was a heavy and complicated thing to reform and ""proviseurs"" were named after being teachers for a period of time (I think it was 5 years at that time, but I have to verify), and then they had to apply to a national competition. Their rank would determine their affectation. So most of the proviseurs were in place or had been in the system before the war, making them a limitation to the implantation of new programs."
"> ... women in Utah were granted the right to vote in 1870, long before nearly any other state in the Union.

This fact probably deserves a question thread unto itself.  My understanding was that the women were protesting the Morrill Anti-Bigamy act... and since they were so in agreement with the status quo, the Utah legislature granted them franchise (to show the US how popular bigamy was).

But like you said, it's complicated."
"While there's been some good information posted here to some other links, I figured I would mention one other thing.  Members of the colonial gentry ate meals quiet a bit more lavished than your average person.   A great example of this (because the sources still exist) is George Washington's Mount Vernon. 

Breakfast was usually served around 7:00AM and prepared by slaves and usually summoned by a bell. [The diary of Benjamin Latrope, who visited the estate in 1796 gave us some interesting insight into what the Washington's served their guests for breakfast](http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/dining-at-mount-vernon/). Breakfast consisted of tea, coffee, and a variety of meats (some even served cold). Other visitors also had breakfasts which heavily favored meat, including ham, cold corned beef, red herring, and cold mutton.  They also were usually accompanied by fresh vegetables. 

Strange as it may seem, chocolate was also sometimes served for breakfast, but usually just when guests arrived.  Washington desired to be a very generous host to his guests.   His accounting books also give us a lot of insight. In 1785, Washington outlined that he's been receiving hundreds of visitors a year and that he feels compelled to honor them with his hospitality.  This included paying for all their meals, which was very expensive.  In this year, he paid for 584 breakfasts (and 757 dinners!).  Hog meat was the meat most used during this year, which they used 16,000 pound of it just for guests -- and none of these figures include his own family members of the cost of feeding the servants and slaves of his guests.

"Despite the efforts of some of the founders, most notably Jefferson, education in the United States falls under the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which means it's up to each state and territory to determine what children do while they're in school. There are some exceptions and parameters, especially with increased federal funding via Johnson's War on Poverty and the elevation of the Department of Education to a cabinet-level agency in 1979, but generally speaking, states determined the look of school. This means it's difficult to speak to an American school history.

However, as your question highlights, there are similarities between schools across the country. Walk into a school in Alaska or Florida and you'll see what you expect to see. These common things - desks and chairs, colorful decorations, separate bathrooms for boys and girls, etc. - are known as the ""grammar of schooling."" (Tyack and Cuban, 1995) They are the seen and unseen things that make school recognizable as a place where children learn. Passed from generation to generation primarily via cultural transmission and tradition, they contribute to a shared understanding of what school is supposed to look like. Some of the features of the grammar of school are national (nearly all US schoolchildren refer to their teachers by a gender identifier and the teacher's last name) some are regional (students in the northeast start summer vacation in July, students in the southwest start in June.) Some have clear pedagogical purposes (calculators in math class) while others are because it's ""always"" been that way (young children walking single file down the hall.)

Where the list of books in your question and the grammar of school intersect is in the traditions of English class. To be sure, no one with any real authority has ever stood up and said: students will read these books for this reason. Books end up in front of students for a variety of reasons after following a variety of paths. More to the point, each of the books you listed is just as likely to have been banned or appear(s/ed) on an informal prohibited books list as having been read by a high schooler somewhere in America. It's helpful to look at feedback loops between HS, society, college, and the canon. 

For most of the 17th, 18th, and parts of the 19th century, students in formal education (mostly white, mostly boys, sometimes girls) experienced a classical curriculum: Greek, Latin, some math, some sciences, logic and rhetoric. The goal wasn't to develop a fluency with Latin in case one ran into a Roman ghost, but to build a young man's thinking skills so that he would be prepared to think deeply about whatever he needed to think deeply about. There was, however, a hierarchy of valued content. Latin was near the the top of that hierarchy, mathematical knowledge was somewhere in the middle, and studying history and literature were near the bottom. Those who shaped what students would do, tutors and school headmasters (virtually all white, virtually all men, mostly located in or from the northeast) typically viewed reading literature as something that was either a waste of time or akin to taking a slow walk while training for a marathon. If a society and those in power didn't see something as essential to their children's success as adults, it likely wouldn't appear in school. Ergo, literature was often left out.

As schools became something more and more something children did, not just the sons of white men with means, there was shift from a brain-building (classical) education to a more practical, useful (modern) curriculum: math, science, history, modern languages, English, Greek/Latin, music, art, gym, etc. This shift included a bit of a shake-down of the hierarchy, which felt chaotic and inefficient to those in charge of formal education at the local level. Those men, known as ""schoolmen"", felt this problem, like most, could be solved by a committee.

In 1893, The National Education Association pulled together a series of committees of school leaders (all white, all men - even those from girls schools or women colleges) from across the country, to describe what was happening in schools and make recommendations for the look of high school in the new century. They had no national authority and were more describing what was popular at the time, than necessarily what could be in the future. The English committee made it clear they wanted the study of literature ""to be made an equal""  with studying Greek/Latin even though the idea was new and perhaps uncomfortable to their fellow schoolmen. (As a reminder, literature, especially modern or popular lit, was seen as a waste of time to those committed to a classical education. If you're familiar with the Reading Wars of the mid-1900's, that was a gentle skirmish compared to the modern vs. classics curriculum battles in the late 1800's and early 1900's.) In their report, they laid out a clear and explicit argument for studying literature: ""to cultivate a taste for reading"" and to give the pupil ""some acquaintance with good literature."" The men in this sub-committee were there because they had opinions: primers were okay in grammar school but by the 7th year of formal education, English class should focus on prose and narrative poems (""sentimental poetry should be discarded"") and whole books. They advocated for 480 total hours reading, discussing, and writing about ""good literature."" They go on to describe the quantity as: 
> That the reading of certain masterpieces of English literature, not fewer in number than those at present assigned by the Commission of New England Colleges, should be required.
> 

The nature of ""good"" is where the canon comes in. The canon is recognized as the books, poems, texts, and plays considered essential to being an educated person. The American canon tilts towards American-born authors and is predominately authored by white men. This lead to another feedback loop: the men on the committees went back to their high schools and told their teachers to teach good literature, teachers pulled from the canon and young people who became teachers used those same books. Whole books became part of the grammar of school in HS English classes.

Another feedback loop emerged around college admissions. Most colleges, especially those with a high degree of prestige, had their own admissions requirements down to which Latin text a student was expected memorize, which was likely to be a different Latin text than the prestigious university the next town over. Eventually, colleges talked to each other, listened to high schools and mostly evened out admissions. However, high schools that wanted to brag about where their students went to school would focus on texts they knew appealed to a particular college admissions' officer. This feedback loop lead to the creation of lists and programs, including [Great Books](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/92wtjw/most_common_books_to_teach_in_high_schools/) and Junior Great Books as well as the National Conference, a group of university and college representatives who established the list of classics that students would need to know and be able to write about for their entrance exams.

Concurrent to these changes around curriculum, the teaching force itself was changing. For generations, it had been a temporary thing a young woman (mostly white) would do before getting married and having children. Much like the push for voting rights, women challenged the notion a woman couldn't teach and be a mother and that the job of being a teacher required professionalism. However. America being a country with deeply sexist roots, well-meaning schoolmen felt teachers needed guidance and help. This sentiment lead to the creation of professional education organizations, such as the The National Council of Teachers of English. Founded by James Fleming Hosic, it was established as a roundtable working group of English teachers and members of the National Education Association in 1911. Unlike the 1894 Committee of Ten, the working group included practicing teachers, many of whom were women (who wouldn't be trusted with leadership positions for years.)

Increasingly school leaders pushed back against the idea of colleges having say in what students in secondary school did and one of Fleming Hosic's goals was to advocate for high school curriculum written by high school teachers based on their goals for their high schoolers - not college admission criteria. Slowly, high school became less a place to prepare for college and more a place that teenagers went. NCTE held (holds) annual conferences where teachers would model curriculum, share lesson plans, reading lists, and diffuse knowledge about English class across the country. As some districts linked teachers' evaluation to participation at such conferences, attendance was high and lists were widely circulated. 

There's one last shift that needs to be addressed before we can get to the particular books on your list and that's the idea that school should be a place that is accessible and welcoming to young people. Progressive education advocates suggested the radical notice adults should consider children's interests when planning curriculum. This notion, spread through conferences like NCTE, meant teachers were increasingly choosing whole class books that reflected current events or ones their students wanted to read. This lead to a shift in what's thought of as canon - all of the texts you listed are now considered part of that canon and have appeared on an NEA or NCTE list or conference session. 

The books on your list became part of the canon because teachers felt they'd appeal to a young person sitting in English class as they deal with authority, social stigma, and rebellion. So, one last feedback loop. Young people read those books in school, grew up to become teachers or curriculum directors, and teach what they were taught."
"For the circum-Mediterranean world: yes, people would know the day of the week and the year--but not necessarily in the way you think.

In terms of year: the BC/AD calendar, which is of course Christian, the actual system comes from Dionysius Exiguus in the early sixth century. But while it was known enough for the occasional early monastic chronicler like Bede to pick up on it, it doesn't appear regularly, really, until the high Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries). The Jewish calendar in terms of year numbering is also a high medieval creation.

But more to the point, that's still limited to use by the educated elite. Only in the Islamic world, I think, is knowledge of calendar year, in hijri of course, widespread by 1019 CE. My assumption is that Christians and Jews living in close contact with Muslims would also be generally aware of the year in AH.

That doesn't mean the Jewish and Christian residents of Christendom didn't also keep track of years. There was certainly some of it. James Palmer reminds us of the story of Abbo of Fleury, who supposedly stood up in the middle of church in Paris and started arguing with the priest whether the year 1000 would be apocalyptically significant. (To be clear: the priest had claimed it would be; Abbo was scoring points for Augustine and Augustinian orthodoxy when he wrote down the story of his disagreement in *Apologeticus*).

But I think in terms of how people *thought*, we should look elsewhere. The world of urban churches was very different from the rural churches most peasants would frequent, for starters. Among other things: a rural priest would almost certainly not be giving a sermon in which to talk about the year 1000. (Abbo is, of course, almost certainly making up the story. But it would still need to seem realistic to his own audience.) 

So: as Michael Clanchy has demonstrated with court records (albeit for later centuries), witnesses figured the year based on ""years since"" a major event in recent local memory, or sometimes in regnal year of the current king. And why not? What are AD and AH if not ""years since"" a major event?

In terms of week day: the obvious point of reference for Muslims, Jews, and Christians was their respective holy day. It's important to keep in mind that attendance at, or participation in, holy day rituals was normative, not descriptive. That is to say, it was the ideal, not necessarily the practice. But in terms of something like day of the week, not everyone would have to observe the Sabbath for the knowledge to be common. 

1019 is sort of the last days of what we call the ""proprietary church"" system, which at the local level would mean the churches most people attended were small, and established and run by lords rather than a diocese. The priest would likely be a resident of one of the villages served by the church. 

As Irina Metzler showed, even in the late Middle Ages, priests are noted in court records as receiving injuries that we might call ""industrial accidents"" or ""can I file for workers' comp for this"". For 1019, even, there are still provisions requiring that priests be freemen--that is, not serfs. Local priests were more than likely blacksmiths, carpenters, farmers when not saying Mass or dispensing sacraments. They were enmeshed in their community life. In this case, that means knowledge of week day was right there next door."

"I lied, [4/3]

CORRECTION:

Above, I said Rozanov had emigrated in the Civil War — that was Wolf's belief. I had read that and forgotten that I had also read another version earlier, which in retrospect I find much more convincing and better-sourced. Neutatz says that Rozanov had actually emigrated in 1906 for organizing a strike, and *returned* in 1917! However, that actually fits with my conclusion nonetheless, I believe — Stalin was so dedicated to painting his opponents as reactionaries that he would ignore facts in that aim. Besides, Rozanov's own politics are not so easy to divine. He was clearly no tsarist, but his emigration and return in 1917 does suggest that he may have been ""bourgeois"", by Stalin's standards — a moderate pro-union social reformer or parliamentarian by ours.

"An army under Pánfilo de Narváez arrived in Mexico in 1520 (sent by the governor of Cuba to rein in Cortes). This new wave of Europeans introduced smallpox to the region and, owing to the virulent nature of smallpox and the total lack of immunity, the disease spread quickly through the population. The same year, smallpox or measles probably killed the emperor of Purepecha at the time (Tzuiangua).

At any rate, the next emperor (Tzintzicha Tangaxoan) ascended to the throne and, upon seeing his Aztec neighbours conquered, decided that submission was preferable. Purepecha pledged allegiance to Spain in 1525 without conflict. Tzintzicha Tangaxoan did not live in peace for long, however; he was executed by the Spanish in 1530 because he was still receiving tribute from his vassals and not passing the proceeds along to his Spanish overlords.

There was quite a gap between the arrival of substantial numbers of Europeans and the eventual capitulation of the Purepecha state - plenty of time for European disease to take its toll on civilians."
"> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed

> Tl;Dr: The second ammendement wasn't passed in spite of Shays' Rebellion, rather it was passed because of Shays' Rebellion.

I wonder why the wording is ""the right of the people"" rather than, ""the right of the state"", then.

Additionally, I read from [this source](http://www.constitution.org/cons/wellregu.htm) that ""well-regulated"" in context meant more that something was ""in working order"". The source advocated this definition with sentences it states are from the Oxford English Dictionary. Is it to be trusted as a source?

**Edit**: Additionally, I find an opposite view being espoused by gun rights sites (and before the Internet, excuse my age, pamphlets) stating, with quotes from leaders of the time, including those who signed and ratified, of their views on the right to bear arms. [Example](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/gun01.htm). Are those views valid?

Examples of quotes:

""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government"" -- Thomas Jefferson, 1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334

""The very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere restrains evil interference - they deserve a place of honor with all that's good"" -- George Washington

""The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed."" -- Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-188

"I think u/restricteddata's answer linked below does a pretty good job of explaining the depiction of radiation based weapons pre-38 but the key point is that they were all based on the understanding of the massive potential  energy bound up in radioactive materials. My area of expertise is more in the history of the weapons themselves (hence my response focusing more on how much the major powers themselves knew about the bomb). My knowledge of The World Set Free mostly comes from the fact that it tends to pop up as an anecdote in essays and books on the history of the bomb, along with a few other stories. I'm by no means an expert on pre-golden age science fiction. All that said, there is another story worth mentioning. Deadline, by Cleve Cartmill was published in a genre magazine which was,amusingly enough, quite popular at Los Alamos. The story was based exclusively on unclassified documents and scholarly papers and featured a cannon type fission bomb fueled by U-235 being used by the allies to win the ongoing war. The fact that Cartmill was reading enough scholarly journals to put all the pieces together on how a supercriticality device would work demonstrates the degree to which sci-fi writers of the time followed the latest science. The fact that all of the information you needed to concieve of a fission bomb was available publically in one nation during a war again points to the fact that the basic feasibility of nuclear weapons being widely understood at the time. That said Cartmill's eerie accuracy in the details did lead to a less than friendly warning from the FBI not to publish any more stories on nuclear weapons.

TL;DR A random pulp mag writer managed to predict the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima down to the method of detonation, method of delivery and specific isotope of Uranium being used a year before it was used, so they were definitely keeping up with the science as a broad group"

I've a follow up question; in British Columbia many of the indigenous tribes never ceded their land; what was the status of the Indigenous people in Alaska and did they have any say in the transaction (I'm assuming not) or is there any record of their protest to the sale?  Were they even aware it happened?
"So the names of locations in Scandinavia often have particular prefixes or suffixes attached to them, these range in meaning.  This is by no means a unique feature, many towns and cities have names that describe their location, geography, or purpose.  In England for example, burh/burgh is evidence that the town stretches back to the burgal system of Alfred and indicates a fortified encampment.  Archaeologists can use the same approach to Scandinavian sites.

Sometimes these place names include the name of deities, and by looking at the number of sites that have particular names you can start to reconstruct a bit of a cult's popularity.  Ullr-place names for example is found all over Scandinavia, Tyr names are found only in Denmark, names invoking Odin are rare, Loki non-existant, so this likely speaks more to the day to day practice of the religion than much later literature."

"I find the historiography of this area really interesting. Apologies for cannibalising a previous post of mine a little.

Gary Webb has complained about how his story was attacked for things that were either minor points or that he never claimed. As he says:

>What they say is that this wasn't an organised conspiracy by the CIA - which no-one ever accused them of in the first place. So I have never understood when people say, ""This didn't happen."" What? I mean, that these people didn't exist? That they didn't bring cocaine into this country? That the Contras didn't benefit from it? What didn't happen? ... The propaganda has succeeded in throwing up such a cloud of doubt over this whole story that, even when the CIA came out and admitted it, nobody was prepared to believe it.

(From *Cocaine: a definitive (sic) history* by Dominic Streatfeild.)

Of course, we have to wonder how much Webb himself is tweaking his memory and judgement to make himself seem better.

However I think you can still see this going on. A lot of the discourse seems to be arguments about who said what, with limited attempts to put it all into a historic context or an excessive desire to stick to the 'hard facts'. There's also the fact this is a great area for urban legends to develop.

What *doesn't* seem to be in dispute is the fact that the CIA provided people who were known to have smuggled drugs with cover to fly in and out of US airspace. On the way out they were running guns to the contras. And on the way in...? As the Kerry Commission put it:

>There was substantial evidence of drug smuggling through war zones on the part of individual Contras, Contra suppliers, Contra pilots, mercenaries who worked with the Contras, and Contra supporters throughout the region ... US officials in Central America failed to address this drug issue for fear of jeopardising the war efforts against Nicaragua ... and senior US policymakers were not immune to the idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the Contras' funding problems.

The CIA denied knowing about any drugs smuggling, but doesn't appear to have provided any evidence it really cared. It stretches credulity to imagine they never expected known drugs smugglers to smuggle drugs. So did agents know and ignore it or were they wilfully blind to it? Does the difference really matter? It seems like some people are all too willing to give the CIA the benefit of the doubt - which is exactly how plausible deniability works.

Some background about the culture and history of the CIA would be very useful to help our judgement here.
So, in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1a9cn3/did_the_cia_really_introduce_cocainecrack_to_the/) /u/gent2012 provides some very useful background about the CIA's history, showing that they were happy to *actively help* drugs smugglers when they thought it was necessary.

At the other end of the scale, the idea that there was a deliberate strategy to introduce cocaine - let alone crack - to US cities does not appear to have any decent evidence to support it.

What's also lurking in the background here is a counterfactual. Was the CIA *responsible* for the rapid increase in cocaine and crack use in the US in the early 80s? This is a somewhat different question to the others. We could acknowledge that the CIA *was* covering for or supporting cocaine smugglers but still think that use of the drug would have increased rapidly without the CIA. I'm not aware of any serious discussion of that - given how little we know about the volumes of cocaine smuggled and distributed via different routes perhaps it's impossible to answer.

**Edit:** Perhaps a clearer way of putting my train of thought is that people need to think about this not as an isolated event, with a bunch of maybe unreliable sources. Instead, it needs to be understood as part of the history of the CIA and part of the history of cocaine and drugs in the US and the Americas. Not that either of those are particularly easy areas to study!"

"He had petitioned for the title for a long time, and Elizabeth refused to grant it. So he (reportedly) told her that since she didn't find him worthy of the title in life, he refused to accept it just before his death."
In my studies people often turn up who went to Spain to only a few years later become famous Yugoslav Partisans fighting the Nazis during the years from 1941-45 – Koča Popović for example. Can similar things be said about volunteers from other countries? Did their motivation (or maybe the necessity) to fight the Nazis extend to them between 39 and 45?
"It's well established now that Mr. Kennedy had a, if you will, *boatload* of health problems for which he was heavily medicated and used adaptive technology to counteract. Official health records and Mr. Kennedy's medical staff confirm this, in particular his debilitating back pain. Biographers have even described a power struggle among physicians treating the president over whether more exercise or continued painkiller injections was the better option for treatment. (Spoiler alert: physical therapy).

Likewise, Arthur Schlesinger's (relatively) recently released interviews with Mrs. Kennedy affirm that on Inauguration Day, she took Dexadrine between the inauguration ceremony and the evening ball to get through it.

So the question is really whether Mr. Kennedy's medical-treatment drug useage extended to ""drugs to lift you up for the event and bring you down gently afterwards"", and whether Mrs. Kennedy repeated her use of an amphetamine.

The difficulty for historians is that the attention here focuses on a shady celebrity doctor named Max Jacobson, who based his treatment program, reputation, and not coincidentally income on a cocktail drug injection based around amphetamines and painkiller. The vast majority of the evidence for Mr. Kennedy's ""off track betting"" use of drugs comes from Jacobson's unpublished biography; he (of course) destroyed his medical records. (And not just drugs adminstered by Jacobson--he tells one anecdote of Mrs. Kennedy discovering Demerol in their bathroom and her asking *him* to convince her husband not to take it). Furthermore, Jacobson was never on the White House medical staff and does not appear among counts of official entourages for various state visits abroad.

Journalist and professor Richard Reeves (*President Kennedy: Profile of Power*) seems to be one of the few writers on the Kennedys who has actually bothered to investigate the possible veracity of Jacobson's claim. Here is the evidence he gathered:

* The FBI file for Jacobson asserts that Mr. Kennedy was listed as one of his patients by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
* Jacobson visited the White House 30+ times from 1961-1962 (in late '62-'63, Mr. Kennedy's official medical staff headed by George Burkley cracked down on his more freewheeling medical treatment preferences, so the timing fits)
* For a presidential trip to Vienna, Dr. and Mrs. Jacobson are listed in White House documents as booked into a room in the entourage hotel
* A memo from Mrs. Kennedy's social secretary notes Dr. Max Jacobson coming to visit *her*--although I'll note that could easily refer to a discussion about her husband's health rather than her own (see the Demerol story above, for example)

The Kennedy presidency was incredibly carefully stage-managed, above all by Mrs. Kennedy herself. (Who was also no slouch in the political arena, recent historiography has begun to reveal.) Sealed records, destroyed records, stigma against people with disabilities, and the eternal popularity of conspiracy theories about/involving/by/against the Kennedys complicate our ability to get a crystal clear picture. However, the evidence suggests that there was a relationship between Jacobson and the Kennedys, and it seems a fair presumption that between Jacobson and Mr. Kennedy at least it was a doctor-patient one.

As to domestic violence, I can only say that (20 year rule applied) the historiography on spousal abuse and U.S. presidents/first ladies is *extremely* sparse. Almost unbelievably so. Rumors circulated that Grover Cleveland's ""boorish"" behavior extended to battery of his wife Frances; she went on public record denying them and affirming that their marriage was basically perfect. Rachel (Mrs. Andrew) Jackson survived an abusive marriage before marrying the future president. I caution that this is referring to physical abuse rather than verbal or emotional. No, I don't think that's the whole story even with the limitations, but scholarship on first ladies is still young and largely hagiographical/biographical. I suspect this is a ""stay tuned"" topic for the future."

"So the answer to this seems to be fairly unsatisfying, which is to say likely ""We don't know"". The combined efforts of several mods were unable to turn up more than a single academic treatment of the specific topic, a paper published this year by Tim Hwang (There are a LOT of papers about lava and the sea floor, though!). The broader concept of the game, that certain areas of the floor or ground are ""No-Go Zones"", can be found across numerous cultures and folk traditions and Hwang mentions several in passing, placing the ""Floor is Lava"" game into the same larger category as the familiar game of Hopscotch, which his own source traces back at least as far as the Roman Empire. 
Hwang also goes beyond only European games though, mentioning also a Kenyan game called *mtezo*, which is described by Wanderi as a 'ground avoidance game' utilizing ropes ties to trees or lianas to swing about and not touch the forest floor.

But of course, this doesn't tell us when the floor became *lava*, just that children have probably been avoiding the floor as long as they have been playing games. That particular permutation *seems* to be a development of the mid-20th century. The earliest mention Hwang has of avoiding the floor or else you'll get *burned*, comes from a Roald Dahl short story entitled ""The Wish"", although if we want to split hairs, the floor there is hot coals, not molten lava:

>A tremendous carpet. Bigger than the tennis lawn. Much bigger than that. He regarded it gravely, setting his eyes upon it with mild pleasure. He had never really noticed it before, but now, all of a sudden the colours seemed to brighten mysteriously and spring out at him in a most dazzling way. You see, he told himself, I know how it is. The red parts of the carpet are red-hot lumps of coal. What I must do is this: I must walk all the way along it to the front door without touching them. If I touch the red I will be burnt. As a matter of fact, I will be burnt up completely. And the black parts of the carpet... yes, the black parts are snakes, poisonous snakes, adders mostly, and cobras, thick like tree-trunks round the middle, and if I touch one of them, I'll be bitten and I'll die before tea time. And if I get across safely, without being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday tomorrow

The story progresses with the protagonist's journey over the carpet, experiencing this small fantasy world that he created. In the end though it is the snakes that get him, not the coals, ""*this bare hand of his going right into the middle of a great glistening mass of black and he gave one piercing cry as it touched.*""

It is of course possible that earlier players of these avoidance games similarly imagined a fiery death would befall their failure to obey the imposed limitations, but the literary evidence for this, at least, is scant. And in any case, the clear growth and appeal of the game, again, Hwang sees as a phenomenon of the latter-half of the 20th century, at least in the US, tying it specifically to the changes in family life and home design, where the growth of the family room as a common and expected part of the American home created a space for children to play in the house that was rarely present in decades past. 

Clear evidence of the development of the game is lacking, and Hwang is careful to note that he ""offers a hypothesis rather than a proof"", but nevertheless he sees a clear, ""suggestive relationship"" between ""The Floor is Lava"" and post-war American family life. The combination of furniture to provide the 'safe zone platforms', the size of the room in comparison to a bedroom, and the casual 'social characteristics' of the family room all combined to make such a game ideally suited to the space.

So in short, children have certainly been avoiding a molten, melty-death on the living room carpet since the 1950s, but whether or not lava or some other fiery danger was what was to be avoided, these 'ground avoidance games' are a very old, and quite worldly, tradition for children through the ages. I will close with one addendum, namely that myself and other mods have been trying to see if we could find an older reference than Dahl *specifically* to lava, or at least a fire floor. No luck yet, but I'd welcome others joining in to help!

However, the authors of this paper do believe that it may be possible to play a short game of 'the walls are lava' if convection currents are taken into account, as long as the room it is being played in doews not have a ceiling and participants attempt to inhale as few gases as possible.

"Just a minor point regarding leavened bread: modern leavened bread is done with ""quick rising"" baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Breads that would have been made prior to the ability to isolate this yeast would have been colonized by wild yeast and bacteria that would vary depending on location. Basically you mix flour and water and allow it to ferment into a 'starter', and use that starter to leaven your dough. Lactobacili (and possibly other bacteria) get involved  and this can lead to a sour taste and in the modern world this is essentially sourdough bread. 

[This article about Egyptian bread](http://www.historicalcookingproject.com/2014/12/guest-post-ancient-egyptian-bread-by.html) illustrates that there is a debate if ""ancient"" bread was all unleavened/unfermented or if some was /some wasn't. 

>*The only element that can bring some debate to this recipe is the yeast. Some scholars believe that the Egyptian breads were mostly flatbreads, similar to the pitas that you can still find in Egypt. Others believe that Egyptians used some kind of leavening. The Bible's Book of Exodus, for example, talks about the Hebrews leaving the unleavened bread to be able to flee from the Egyptians.*


It is entirely possible to leaven bread in most climates (arctic being a possibly exception) and considering many of the cultures in question had at least basic knowledge about fermenting alcohol they likely understood that at least some flours would rise well if left to ferment. 

As a side note: making sourdough bread is incredibly easy, fun, and cheap. If you haven't tried it I would highly recommend it."

"This is a complex question with hundreds of books written about it. It’s always hard to say why something didn’t happen, and it’s also always hard to write a simple account of such macro-sociological phenomenon. 

So, this cannot possibly be an exhaustive list, but let me now just run through some of the more popular answers:

**America’s Unique Class Structure** The first is the classical Marxist explanation. First thing we have to realize is that most people in most countries were rural (later note: I spent a little too long focusing on rural politics because I misread your question, but I promise part three gets into explanations). There, the rural peasantry/serfs and rural proletariat are inherently “non-revolutionary”.  Let me point out that, before you even gave all American examples, the way you phrased your question clearly put it in the (North) American context. When we see Left Wing movements of various kinds in Europe, the rural population is frequently either divided, a non-factor, or on the side of the reactionary right. The most famous study on this I know is Charles Tilly’s *The Vendée*. See, the Vendée was a region in France that witnessed the most significant popular uprising against the French Revolution. Their state purpose was that they were defending the King and the Church (pay attention to the (c)hurch, because that’s going to be a reoccurring theme). To overly simply the book’s nuanced argument, Tilly essentially argues that the peasant rebels in the Vendée felt that they had more in common with their noble landlords than they felt they did with the distant revolutionary democrats of Paris. This sort of thing is common.  In 19th century Russia, Narodist (non-Marxist social movements) kept “going to the peasants” and the peasants kept… not really doing much for their political program. Certainly, the peasants might occasionally sack the manor house and burn all the records of debt, but peasant agitation (as James C. Scott has argued in basically all of his books) is very different from the urban social and political movements we imagine. The peasants resisted systems of control through “every day resistance” like “foot-dragging, evasion, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance, slander and sabotage.” But the peasants’ concerns were mainly local.

Marx sort of hated them for this reason. Well, hated them politically, at least. Here’s a little bit from the *The Eighteenth Brumaire *:

> The small-holding peasants form an enormous mass whose members live in similar conditions but without entering into manifold relations with each other. Their mode of production isolates them from one another instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse. […] A small holding, the peasant and his family; beside it another small holding, another peasant and another family. A few score of these constitute a village, and a few score villages constitute a department. **Thus the great mass of the French nation is formed by the simple addition of homologous magnitudes, much as potatoes in a sack form a sack of potatoes.** Insofar as millions of families live under conditions of existence that separate their mode of life, their interests, and their culture from those of the other classes, and put them in hostile opposition to the latter, they form a class. Insofar as there is merely a local interconnection among these small-holding peasants, and the identity of their interests forms no community, no national bond, and no political organization among them, they do not constitute a class. They are therefore incapable of asserting their class interest in their own name, whether through a parliament or a convention. They cannot represent themselves, they must be represented. 

So, what you’re seeing in your American history textbooks is in many ways atypical of the political behavior of rural populations globally. I tend to agree to some extent with the right-leaning political scientist Samuel Popkin who argued in his seminal *The Rational Peasant* (the book is an answer and “rebuttal” to James C. Scott, but I think they can be read side by side just as easily as against each other) that the peasant is in many ways inherently conservative because both long and short term substance crises are always on the horizon. The peasant is small-c conservative because change always has the risk of increasing the odds of famine.

But America doesn’t have peasants, and that’s a hugely important distinction. The quintessential American for much of the 18th and 19th century (whether we follow Jackson or Jefferson’s vision, Crevecoeur or de Tocqueville’s) was the yeoman farmer. There were, of course, many other types of rural labor relationships, especially slavery, sharecropping, indentured servitude, and rural proletarians (that just means they worked for someone for wages, rather than primarily working their own land), but the one seen as most typical—and the one common to all the examples you cite—is the yeoman farmer. Yeomans owned land, peasants frequently didn’t (they were tenants of large landowners, or worked as wage earners). Peasants frequently had a relationship with a lord or local notable. The yeoman farmer was meant to be an equal citizen (at least in America) and in many communities the class inequality wasn’t particularly severe, at least compared to Europe. Even in England in this period, the rural class structure is frequently thought of as “landlord, tenant, and laborer”, with the freeholding yeoman relatively rare. But in America (and in many other settler colonies like Canada and Australia), they were the norm.

The term “American exceptionalism” has come to mean in the present day some sort of jingoism that America cannot err and has a unique, quasi-divine role on the world stage, but the first recorded instance of the phrase is actually not this sort of thing at all. Stalin, apparently, was the first one to use the term arguing *against* American exceptionalism. What was the exception? Well, some members of the Communist Party were arguing that America didn’t quite fit into the classical Marxist structure because American class structure was fundamentally different, in large part because of these yeoman farmers. (How connected the usages of the 1930’s in Communist circles and the current use by the Neoconservative Right is argued over; [the tern’s Wikipedia page has a decent run-down]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_exceptionalism)).

Obviously, later Marxist thinkers starting really with Mao argued that the peasants *could* be revolutionary, and there were attempts at Marxist peasant revolutions in Latin America, South East Asia, and Sub-Saharan African. All Marxists count peasants as ""workers"", and one of the key constituent group of socialist society (fun note: the hammer and the sickle is meant to represent the urban worker and the rural peasant, respectively. Some communist movements have updated those symbols to be more meaningful to the local time and place. The best is probably the flag of Angola, which contains a gear and a machete, representing the tools that Angolan urban workers and peasants were commonly making use of in 1975). We have seen peasant-led revolutions, but usually one of the most fundamental claims is land reform (i.e. redistribution of land from the big land owners to the peasants). While it's rarely discussed in America, this in many places was the fundamental grievance for rural politics and also the biggest wealth transfer in national history. [America even at one point forced the South Vietnamese government to perform land reform in hopes of stymying support for the Viet Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform_in_South_Vietnam).

But that, in many ways, only emphasizes American exceptionalism, that likely also applies to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc. Rural class relations, and therefore rural politics, was so fundamentally different in America that an explanation dealing with America couldn't possibly apply to many other parts of the world. Even in other parts of the New World (not to mention much of the American Deep South), colonial powers created the *hacienda* and similar large land-owning estates created a creole aristocracy who either had slaves or peasants working the estates, essentially recreating the same sort of hierarchical rural social relations that long dominated much of the Old World.

So, that doesn't explain anything in and of itself, and is really just prelude to what *did* happen in America. Before we get into the more specific explanations of what happened between now and the point of time you mention, I thought it was important to note here that, in many ways, that period of time for American farmers was the more atypical one, world-historically.

"You address how the American Medical Association isn't a cartel and isn't even in charge (by itself) of limiting the number of medical students today.

You didn't go much into the deep history, though (and you didn't have to—you wrote a long long post without it). I wish I knew it better but let me touch on a few things: namely, that what makes the AMA special is much more how expensive medical schools are, *not* that a professional gets incredibly wide autonomy about deciding who can join their profession and where that pre-professional training can be given.

There's a big literature in sociology on the topic of ""professionalization"". This is how jobs become professions. The two ""classic"" books on this on Paul Starr's *The Social Transformation of American Medicine* (which is all about the AMA) and Andrew Abbott's *The System of Professions : an essay on the division of expert labor,* (which looks at professions more broadly, but his primary example—the one he wrote his much earlier dissertation on—is the American Psychiatric Association). Starr's book even won the Bancroft prize, which is one of the *big* prizes in history, and it's very rare for social scientists to win (though not unheard of—political scientist Ira Katznelson won in 2014, for instance).

It's been a long time since I've touched either book, but the basic idea of professionalization is that you need social closure and credentialing: you need a clear way of marking people as legitimate practitioners of your profession or charlatans. In some countries, this is done initially at the government level, but in the U.S., with its mish-mash of jurisdictions, this was frequently done first by private associations of (soon-to-be) professionals whose work was later enshrined in law by the government (and also challenged and negotiated). 

The classic example of a profession self-regulating is the bar. The Bar Association is not a government licensing body, but is rather the professional association of lawyers. They get to choose who can practice law in the country—who is ""admitted to the bar"". What the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, etc. One defining feature of professional fields is that the professionals are sovereign over their standards. 

This credentialing usually arises because the (soon-to-be) professionals think they are doing a good job and think there are a bunch of hacks out there. The first licensure for engineers, for example, came in Wyoming, because a lot of non-engineers were doing these awful irrigation projects. One thing that's incredible is how fast this sort of professionalization can occur: the first state to demand licensed engineers was Wyoming in 1907. The last state was Montana in 1947, only 40 years later. Today, all engineering schools are licensed by Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), which, like the AMA, like the Bar, like the American Psychiatric Association, is a private non-governmental organization.

So the AMA was just one of many professional organizations following the same path. I wish I remembered the details of Abbott and Starr's related arguments, and all the cool details about the AMA in particular, but as [one review of Starr's book begins](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-42266-019), ""Starr traces the development of medicine in America from the 18th century , in which physicians were poor, untrained and often ridiculed, through their rise to positions akin to an aristocracy which is lavished with social status, cultural authority, and remarkable material reward"". (The first half of Starr's book is about the AMA established professional sovereignty and the second half is how things like HMOs, regulations, and big corporations are increasingly impinging on that sovereignty in the 1980's.) Though there were key changes to the practice of medicine like, you know, the discovery germ theory, the AMA/professionalization is still undeniably the key to the change in how doctors are positioned in society.

Remembering work I haven't looked at in a few years, I think the pattern is something like it's something like there's a recognized problem of poor practitioners, a group of professionals comes together and starts agitating for professional closure, a credentialing (and therefore education) system is organized, and then this credentialing system is accepted by state authorities (in America, it's usually a state-by-state process, but occurs over a surprisingly short time). In this process, the professional group establishes their trustworthiness, legitimacy, and (very importantly) autonomy and sovereignty over their profession. They're the ones who get to set the fundamental rules about who is or isn't part of their profession.

In this sense, there's nothing that special about the AMA limiting recognizing some set number of medical schools—it's what every profession does. The special thing is just how expensive and subsidized medical schools are, as you /u/aedes point out. Ping: u/RusticBohemian"

From what I recall my studies and reading, Rome tended to impose certain systems upon their subjects but didn't completely eradicate the identity of those peoples so there would possibly be an opportunity for those peoples to rise in society and perhaps impact some aspect of Roman culture as a whole. Then again, it was likely wiser to simply assimilate to Roman standards regardless of origin if one wanted to gain any true power.

"So I'll take a stab at this, but I'm afraid there isn't going to be a satisfying answer.  And my academic English isn't well practiced right now.  I'm a linguist and I specialize in historical linguistics and phonology, so the etymology of surnames is something I've studied.

Surnames have developed in different ways at different times throughout the world, so I'm going to ignore a lot of information and just focus on England since we're dealing with English surnames.  Normans brought the practice of surnames to England in 1066.  There were several options for strategies to surnaming that are common to the western world that England also followed:  1) your surname was  your occupation (Smith, Fletcher, Cook, Taylor, Turner, Knight, etc.).  2) your surname was the place where you lived.  This could be a very specific place in the case of wealthy land owners, the name of a castle for example (this is/was a strong tradition among nobility), or it could be slightly more generic like the name of a town, lake, river, mountain etc. (Preston, Hilton, Stanley, Thames ).  Or it was even more generic and was just the name of a ""nearby"" geographic feature without a proper name (Heath, Dale, Hill).  Some in England used their father's given name as their surname (Johnson, Davidson, etc.).  They could even be strictly descriptive (Redhead, Black, Little, Armstrong). This is not an exhaustive list of strategies, but these were the most common.

However, for a long time, these names were not fixed.  If you changed occupation, or moved, then you changed your surname.  It wasn't until the 1400s that this system becomes mostly stable and strictly hereditary.

Now, having the last name of a cardinal direction stems from the ""generic place name"" strategy.  People would've chosen them because they lived or were from ""north"" or ""west"" of something, probably in or near a town, or a prominent geographic feature and more rarely for having immigrated from one of those directions.  So it's impossible to say \*specifically\* what each instance of this surname referred to.  The name ""West"" was for example most common in Essex, which is as far east as you can be in England!  ""South"" and ""East"" aren't particularly common, but language has evolved dramatically since the Norman conquest and other forms do exist such as [""Eastes,"" ""Estes"", and ""Este.""](https://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/East) For ""South"" there exists a [large number of variations](https://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/South) ( Soth, Sother, Sotheron, Southers, Southern, Soutt, Soot, Soots, Sowte, and Zute, there also exists variations of a different sort in surnames like Sutherland, or Southard).

If you were to add up all the possible variations that exist for South and East, I bet the numbers get much closer.  Any remaining difference is just pure chance.  People weren't given cardinal direction surnames in equal numbers, and those families haven't passed down the names in equal numbers.  Which names survive and which dwindle is largely just chance, and this is true for all surnames.  Obviously, certain surnames, like common occupations such as ""Smith"" have an edge but otherwise there was no method to giving everyone surnames.  It was a free and chaotic process.  So I'm afraid, there isn't a specific reason.

"There were two main reasons to build a town in the arid West: to exploit mineral resources or to act as a distribution hub. The latter were almost always associated with a railroad stop - so they had an obvious means for bring resources into the town. For mineral resources, one built a town where the resource existed. No one would have built Virginia City (or even a small collection of structures) at that location if it were not for hundreds of millions of dollars in gold and silver (today, billions of dollars in value). 

Movies about the Wild West often have sets (often exploiting the same set repeatedly) showing a town in a flat, arid location, and there is often no clear reason why that town exists there. These depictions convey the wrong impression for people who wish to understand the ""mechanics"" of how the West functioned."

"You pretty much covered it all. Fantastic answer. Donatello is considered to be the foundation of renaissance sculpting-- that which the likes of Michelangelo and his peers would have looked up his work during their nascent careers. Picking him as the fourth ninja turtle is perfectly justified, but I would have perhaps made an addition, as amusing as it would have been to have a fifth ninja turtle named ""Brunie"". But I disgress. Interestingly enough, Donatello's most famous sculpture is also a [David](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ikdlSp53Sq8/TpJAnnEYCWI/AAAAAAAAAkI/BVIl0k-tGOM/s640/640px-Donatello_-_David_-_Floren%25C3%25A7a.jpg) so the comparisons drawn to Michelangelo's David are unavoidable. It broke ground on several fronts and is considered to be one of if not Donatello's greatest work. You're right in saying that there are clear influences of Gothic art creeping into Italy at the time and it shows in Donatello's David in my opinion, but I would say the Italians, proud of their Roman heritage and understandably miffed at the invasions from their Gallic neighbors, managed to rebuke most traces of that horrid French style by the time that the High Renaissance rolled around. 

Ironically, it's Leo who's the odd one out if we're looking strictly at artistic impact on the Renaissance. Leonardo, son of Piero from Vinci was not a particularly prolific artist. Where Michelangelo ~~easily~~ (nearly?) cleared triple digits worth of ~~sculptures~~ artworks if you'd count multi-faceted works like the Tomb of Julius II as multiple pieces, Leonardo has comparatively few artworks attributed to his name and the majority of those were paintings-- significantly less demanding than sculpting (fite me). Of course, Leonardo was every much as talented as Michelangelo, probably more so if we're giving points to versatility but the man seemed to lack the manic drive that his successor did. I hear of the the fact that the Mona Lisa only because so famous because of its grandiose theft by an Italian nationalist who tried to return it to the Uffizi in Florence. I can't speak for that explanation's veracity, but I will say it's probably the Last Supper that would have been Leonardo's most significant work if the Mona Lisa didn't exist. Maddeningly, Leonardo skimped out in terms of effort when painting it. Instead of using the *boun fresco* technique to paint the Last Supper, which was an arduous, labor-intensive process which involved applying wet plaster to a wall and then painting into the wet plaster, Leonardo did the *fresco-secco* method, which was literally just painting onto dry plaster. Supposedly this was so Leonardo could get greater detail and vibrancy into the fresco itself, but the overall culture of the art world suffered for that decision. The fresco was little more than paint with egg binding brushed onto lead-dusted dry plaster, hence why the fresco underwent numerous restorations to keep it from essentially disintegrating."

This is such am interesting answer to a very sad question. Thank you!
"It's a product of our understanding of what battle planning looks like that we assume a flanking attack requires maps. Why would it? 

When the Athenians attacked Potidaia in 432 BC, the Potidaians made an arrangement with their Chalkidian allies that they were to charge into the Athenian rear as soon as the two sides were engaged, alerted by a signal on the walls. The Athenians, however, anticipated the attack and blocked the Chalkidians with their own cavalry. There was no need for maps here, only an understanding of where everyone was on the plain outside the city.

When the Spartans attacked Argos in 418 BC, the Argives assembled outside the walls to confront them. However, the Spartans had divided their coalition army into 3 groups, each descending into the Argolid by a different route. While their main body approached the Argive army head-on, the other two (including all their cavalry) came up from the rear. There was no need for elaborate maps to plan this, only a basic knowledge of the routes into the Argolid and the time it took to march along them.

When the Athenians fought the Peloponnesians and Akarnanians at Olpai in 426 BC, they knew that the enemy outnumbered them and that their line would be overmatched. The Athenian commander Demosthenes therefore hid 400 men in a hollow road along the battlefield, with orders to charge into the enemy rear once the lines were engaged. Demosthenes himself took command of the right wing that was about to be encircled, leading from the front to keep his men fighting until the trap was sprung.

As you can see, on both a tactical and an operational level, it's perfectly possible to organise well-timed flanking attacks without the use of maps. It only requires knowledge of the terrain and the distances involved. Orders were given in advance and were not subject to further correction. It was up to the leaders of the flanking contingents whether or not to follow the plan; the commander simply had to trust that they would. Nowadays we do this stuff with maps, but maps are not necessary to do it. When we assume that generals must give careful orders to plan out the exact motions of units on a master map, we are projecting the Napoleonic or 19th century Prussian idea of generalship onto a past to which it does not apply."

"If you are looking for interviews of people who witnessed both events you can consider the book [The Last Men Of The Revolution](http://www.americanrevolution.org/lastmen.php) was published in 1864, and contains photographs and interviews of 7 men claiming to be veterans of the Revolutionary war.

"In late Anglo-Saxon England, the defence of the kingdom was heavily bureaucratised. A document called *The Burghal Hidage* is a list of *burhs* - fortified garrison sites at major transport nexi and often proto-urban sites - and the calculations necessary to determine their manpower and logistical needs. The document itself lists 31 *burhs* in Wessex and 2 in Mercia and is thought to have been compiled during the reign of Edward the Elder (*c*.899-924).  It's commonly held to be either a work in progress or an aspirational document rather than a definite reflection of the situation, and lists only the defensive sites in the Wessex heartlands, omitting Kent, Mercia and East Anglia, but its calculations are extensive.

Defensive walls were measures in ""poles"" - approximately the length which could be ably defended by a man. This is very roughly approximate to 1.5m. For each pole, about a hide of land was necessary to support a man of the garrison. The actual size of a ""hide"" is unclear, and land is often measured in *sulungs* or *cassati*. It's likely a measurement of production rather than area. From the figures provided in *The Burghal Hidage* of lands allotted for  burghal defence, we can determine the approximate garrisons of various *burhs*. Winchester and Wallingford, for example, had 2,400 men each, while Oxford's garrison was 1,400. "
">During the reign of Charlemagne there were embassies between Francia and the Abbasids of the Middle East that also resulted in the movement of goods, including an elephant of all things that found its way to Charlemagne's court, as well as people who moved between the two areas. **The situation in Northern Europe was hardly different.**

Is there any evidence that there were such embassies in Northern Europe? I understand Islamic silver has been found in Scandinavia, but saying the situation was ‘hardly different’ between how Francia and the Abbasids interacted vs Northern Europe would seem to warrant further explanation because that’s way off base from what I’ve been taught. Francia was an epicentre of geopolitical influence and power and held far more strategic value in an alliance than a pagan king in Denmark for example, let alone Norway, Sweden or Iceland."

"Honestly, even the ""fact"" that the Balfour Declaration was part of a Jewish effort to bring the US into World War I is incredibly wrong, given that the Balfour Declaration was issued on November 2, 1917, and the US had declared war on Germany over half a year earlier, on April 6.

"So you're a filthy London street urchin, and you're trying to figure out what to do with that sixpence Mr. Holmes just generously gave you to follow some cove and report back? It's hard to say, since prices varied widely. Bread rose and fell with the economy, and at the worst times it might cost several times what it cost otherwise. But let's look in general terms.

Sixpence might buy you three nights' stay in a shared bed in a lodging house (a ""doss house""), which was about tuppence/night.

If you wanted a simple meal, perhaps some bread with some butter, it might cost you a penny. For three pence (or ""thruppence), you'd get a more proper meal, an ""ordinary,"" such as a stew with meat in it, bread and butter on the side, and a cup of beer to wash it down. A pint of beer might be 2-3 pence. If you wanted a quart of milk, that would run you around 4-6 pence. A pound of the cheapest tea would be around that sixpence you just made. And potatoes, as today, were very cheap: you could get a pound for a penny or less. 

Sixpence was also a fairly typical cab fare per mile. 

As for clothes, you could buy yourself... maybe a collar, or if you're lucky a pair of cuffs (both were separate from the shirt). A nice suit would be 2 pounds, which comes to 80 times what you just made (better hope Mr. Holmes has lots more crimes for you to follow!).

It might not sound like much, but the writer Henry Mayhew in 1849 in *London Labor and the London Poor,* a very readable (though questionably factual) source mentioned right below, describes a young crossing-sweeper who says she gets 6-8 pence *per day* working from nine in the morning till four at night.

Not having watched ""Nuremberg"", I'm admittedly assuming that the scene you're referencing is at least loosely based on the testimony on the afternoon of the eighth day of court- November 29, 1945. On this day, Commander James Britt Donovan of the prosecution entered into evidence an hour long film entitled simply ""Nazi Concentration Camps."" If this is wrong, let me know and I'll delete this comment myself.

I first want to address your actual question in saying the vomiting is likely a dramatization- that's not to say that there weren't physical reactions, but crying and breaking down seemed more common. In doing further scouring of this, I am not finding any notes on any type of a visceral reaction. However, [a letter dated December 1st, 1945](https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/research-files/letter-robert-jackson-harry-s-truman-accompanied-related-materials?documentid=NA&pagenumber=1) from Robert H Jackson, the chief prosecutor for the United States, to Harry Truman stated:
> Our photographic evidence of concentration camps was so good that three of the defendants broke down and cried.

Now as mentioned, the film was submitted just 8 days into the trial, and this was the the longest film entered into evidence up to this point. However by this point all members of the court had spent months actively preparing this effort, with the London Conference starting in June of that year. Nor was it unknown by any stretch the atrocities committed, as information gathering had been unfolding since the start of the war. These atrocities were even formally recognized in the [Moscow Declaration of 1943](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/moscow.asp) (Section: Statement on Atrocities), which is referenced often through the formation of the International Military Tribunal.

While I'm not sure of any films specifically looking at the IMT, I have found a reaction video from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum [here](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/film/reactions-to-film-shown-at-nuremberg) where we can see the reactions of some of the defendants and some others in the courtroom. While there is clearly uneasiness, there's no vomiting, or even particularly rushing to leave the room filmed here. In another of their articles [here](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/combating-holocaust-denial-evidence-of-the-holocaust-presented-at-nuremberg#photographs-and-film-as-evidence-2) we do see the following:
> When the lights came up in the Palace of Justice all assembled sat in silence. The human impact of this visual evidence was a turning point in the Nuremberg trial. It brought the Holocaust into the courtroom.

There's further evidence that this likely was a dramatization from the trial transcripts: ""[the Blues Series](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/NT_major-war-criminals.html)"" is a set of such transcripts provided by the Library of Congress. The related information is in [Volume 2 (pdf)](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Vol-II.pdf), pages 432-434, which quite clearly shows the lack of any statements regarding what they just witnessed- they watched the film, and then adjourned for the day. 

Due to the time the court was involved in this effort, even by this point relatively early in the actual trial, the court still knew what they were getting into, which might explain the lack of more gut wrenching reactions.

Edit:  
I want to clarify my use of ""likely a dramatization"" above- Off hand, there were 8 members of the Tribunal, 18 members of the general secretariat, 51 members of the prosecution, 40 members of the defense, as well as any staff that may not have been listed, and 24 defendants, not including a few groups of defendants such as SS and Gestapo (Counts taken from [Volume 1 of the Blue Series (pdf)](https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Vol-I.pdf)). To get each individuals reaction, assuming many were in attendance, would be quite the task that at this point in time I'm unable to do. It is absolutely possible that some vomited, especially in private, however I know of no such obvious recorded evidence that they did."
"Hello! This is a great question. It really stems more from our modern understanding (in the West) of what an ""ideal"" government is, along with a misunderstanding of the origins of the French Revolution!

Briefly before diving in, let's touch on those two misconceptions.

1. Republics or Democracies are the most liberal, democratic, best forms of government

This actually is very much a modern idea! Unfortunately it's an anachronism that we don't even realize is an anachronism. I touch on the French Revolution specifically in my answer below, but suffice it to say that during the Enlightenment, men such as Voltaire actually came to the conclusion that ""Enlightended Despotism"" was the ideal form of government. Of course this has roots all the way back to Plato's ""Philosopher King"" so it wasn't anything new, but in the West we have essentially been taught that Republics and Democracies are the best form of government, and were thought of as the best form of government in the past as well, which is not true. I highly recommend Aristotle's *Politics* for anyone interested more in this subject, as he goes over different types of government and it's awesome. As for the French Revolution as I touch on in my answer, the French were essentially backed into a Republic after other, more preferrable governmental methods failed.

2. Misunderstanding of the origins of the French Revolution

I go into this more in my answer below, but the French Revolution was NOT about the peasants or the lower classes, or even the 'enlightened' classes, rising up to institute a democracy. Virtually everyone in France was perfectly fine with being ruled by one man. The French didn't want to radically alter their government, *they wanted* ***better*** *government!* This could be achieved by a constitutional monarchy, their preferred method. The Republic, as I mentioned above, was essentially backed into after the King's flight to Varennes. Even men we identify with the Republic of Virtue such as Robespierre did not champion a Republic until it was in place and their only option. When you mention an anti-monarchical surge in 1793-1793, it's important to know that this wasn't targeted at monarchy *in general*, but at the ""ministirial despotism"" of the Boubrons specifically. Since about the 1750s voices had been growing louder that the ministers of the Bourbon monarchs held a despotic stranglehold over their people. Often the Kings (Louis XV and Louis XVI) were portrayed as little more than impotent puppets, sitting useless on their throne while a small band of debauched and greedy ministers swirled around them, bleeding their people dry. The French more than anything else demanded that this system be reformed, but they did not  as their core principle find fault with the institution of monarchy.

Okay now on to my answer! I have actually answered the same quesiton here! Please note that my writing above is merely an introduction to this specific post, but the following constitutes my full answer: [Considering that one of the reasons why the French Revolution happened was to end the French Oligarchy, how come the French later accepted Napoleon as their new emperor of France?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gli6nn/considering_that_one_of_the_reasons_why_the/)

**Additional Reading:** 

Interested in the political thoughts of the early Revolutionaries? 

Read Timothy Tackett's *Becoming a Revolutionary*. This book relies on primary sources, in the forms of the National Assembly's archives, letters home from delegates, and personal journals of delegates, to show what the Revolutionaries were really thinking at the beginning of the Revolution! Highly recommend for anyone who perhaps wants to dig deeper into my statements about the early Revolution being about better government, rather than radically different government.

Interested in public opinion during the pre-Revolution? 

Read Robert Darnton's *The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France*. While this is a literary history, it's the best book I've encountered that touches on public opinion before the French Revolution, which is an oft overlooked area of study. What were the French actually thinking before the Revolution? It's a question this book seeks to answer through looking at literature, journals, gossip, etc.

Interested in an overview of the Revolution?

Read Peter McPhee's *Liberty or Death*, the hands-down best summary of the Revolution I've read. I find his reading style very engaging, which is important for how long this book is! It also has the merit of doing justice to post-Thermidorian France, which is crucial to understanding the question of Napoleon's rise. Often we skip from the Fall of Robespierre to the Coup of Napoleon as if those were events that happened in quick succession, but there were **five years** in between these events. Not to mention it wasn't until 1804 that Napoleon was crowned Emperor, putting **ten years** from the fall of Robespierre. To put that into perspective, the whole entirity of the rest of the Revolution was only five years (1789-1794). McPhee does a great job of giving this often disregarded period its just dues, and certainly helps give a much fuller picture of the Revolution through doing so.

**Edit**: I have gotten feedback that in this answer it seems as though I'm discounting the period after 1792, when the French generally embraced the Republic, and those who supported it viciously denounced the monarchists. I certainly do not mean for my statement to read this way, and I write extensively on the period from 1793-1794 if anyone is interested in my further answers there ([link to my profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/myskinsredditacct)). The reason I focus on the mentality at the beginning of the Revolution is to highlight the fact that the French did not approach the Revolution with the intent of ridding themselves of a monarch. This focus is necessary to answer the question at hand, which is why the French were then able to stomach a single man rule once more. I dive more into this in a comment below ([Comment can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hs674m/how_did_the_people_of_france_go_from_executing_a/fy976hl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)), but I definitely do not discount the radical surge of republican fervor that peaked from 1793-1794. I do think it's important to point out (Peter McPhee does a great job of this in his *Liberty or Death*) that after the Thermidorian reaction, the Directory slowly eroded the enthusiasm for the republic. The Terror had already gone a long way towards this disenchantment, but after 5+ years of the Directory losing love from both sides of the political spectrum, the people of France were generally not opposed to seeing it go. The reason that I highlight the beginning of the Revolution so much in my post is because when they do see the Directory fall, there isn't an ingrained philosophy that rule by one man is inherently evil, which is the crux of the question at hand. The French are (generally) willing to accept Napoleon because they did not go into the Revolution with the mindset that a Republic was the only viable form of government. Hopefully this clears up the misconception that I'm dismissing the radicalism of the Revolution, as I certainly did not wish to give that impression. The Revolution is a large subject, and it's difficult to answer a question without letting the scope explode."

"An interesting question. Anderson uses the Bourbons and Habsburgs a lot during his book, so I'll try to give you a brief rundown of his criticisms.

His main issue with the idea of modern civic/ethnic nationalism hijacking the concept of the old feudal monarchy is one of the lack of an identity overlap between the two. He quotes Oscar Jászi for his initial criticism of the Habsburg system. Jászi was one of the many leftist intellectuals that attempted to carve their way through the political mess that was the immediate aftermath of the downfall of Austria-Hungary. He briefly cooperated with the Hungarian communists, before leaving the movement due to his dissatisfaction with the communist rejection of intellectualism. As you might imagine, Jászi was not the biggest fan of the Habsburg monarchy.

>Here, in somewhat abbreviated form, is the later dynasts' titulature.
>
>>Emperor of Austria; King of Hungary, of Bohemia, of Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia, Lodomeria, and Illyria; King of Jerusalem, etc; Archduke of Austria; Grand Duke of Tuscany and Cracow; Duke of Lotharingia, of Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, and Bukovina; Grand Duke of Transylvania, Margrave of Moravia; Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia, of Modena, Parma, Piacenza, and Guastella, of Ausschwitz and Sator, of Teschen, Friaul, Ragusa, and Zara; Princely count of Habsburg and Tyrol, of Kyburg, Görz and Gradiuska; Duke of Trient and Brizen; Margrave of Upper and Lower Laustiz and in Istria; Coutn of Hohenembs, Feldkirch, Bregenz, Sonnenberg, etc.; Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro, and above the Windisch Mark; Great Voyyod of the Voyvodina, Servia ... etc.
>
>This, Jászi justly observes, was, 'not without a certain comic aspect ... the record of the innumerable marriages, hucksterings and captures of the Habsburgs.'

So, it's first of all pretty clever writing by Anderson to just smash the reader with all these titles to overwhelm them with the sheer pretentiousness of old noble houses and their claims to post-feudal kingships, but it also serves as a transition to the question of the Bourbons.

The main thing that Anderson continues to criticise is that nationalistic movements continue to put value in the monarchies, even though the monarchs on their end never seemed to have put great value in the nationhoods.

In this case, the House of Bourbon is primarily criticized for its apparent disloyalty to France and willingness to dabble in Spain.

>In realms where polygyny was religiously sanctioned, complex systems of tiered concubinage were essential to the integration of the realm. In fact, royal lineages often derived their prestige, aside from any aura of divinity, from, shall we say, miscegenation? For such mixtures were signs of a superordinate status. It is characteristic that there has not been an 'English' dynasty ruling in London since the eleventh century (if then); and what 'nationality' are we to assign to the Bourbons?
>
>[...]
>
>What nationality should be assigned to Bourbons ruling in France and Spain, Hohenzollerns in Prussia and Rumania, Wittelsbachs in Bavaria and Greece?

That is actually an interesting question by the way - the nationality of the houses and what it takes to change them. The House of Windsor was only able to shake off its Germanness through a war against Germany in which the royals rallied the British patriotism - the idea that a royal house would have to cater to its people is, in the grand scheme of things, pretty new by the way.

Anderson is very concerned with the question of legitimacy, as it to him is central to the idea of his 'imagined communities' that they share some core values that are apparently unchanging, with heroic figures to look up to and admire. But the Bismarcks, Napoleons and Alexander Nevskis of history are all deceased, and any nationalistic movement needs a vision for currently living people to take the helm of the country. That is where fascist or communits cults of personality or the monarchist restoration movements might jump in to fill the gap.

It is however worth noting that he has a tendency to compare distant houses to the Bourbons as well when he mocks tendencies to intermarry with foreigners. He calls Wachirawut, better known as Rama VI of Thailand (1880-1925, r. 1910-1925), ""a sort of Asian Bourbon"".

>In a pre-national era his ancestors had readily taken attractive Chinese girls as wives and concubines, with the result that, Mendelianly-speaking, he himself had more Chinese 'blood' than Thai.

But, aside from this weird fixture on genetics that Anderson sometimes reveals, his criticism of the likes of the Bourbons and Habsburgs remains an interesting thought nonetheless: We think of them as French and German/Austrian noble houses respectively - but why? In fact, the last kingdom to recognize the Habsburg rule was Horthy's Hungary. France nowadays is a republic, but Spain is a kingdom with a Bourbon king. And if the Windsors get to be British rather than German, at what point do the Bourbons get to be Spanish rather than French?

Food for thought."
"What, pray tell, is a long boot if the short boot is knee-thigh high?!"
"In the specific contexts in which the character is recognised - first at a tournament and second in the streets of London - he would have been pretty noticeable, but in a wider context the answer is 'no'. 

At a tournament, he would be in the company of his own nobility. In the film, this is what Edward was worried about. He didn't want people to go easy on him or forfeit on account of his royal blood, and wanted royalty to be treated like any other competitor. In reality, Edward's father, Edward III, actually did this by having his tournament team all wear identical kit with helmets that covered their faces to reinforce the idea that royalty aren't anything special at a tournament. You can read more about that in an answer [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/erzkls/in_a_knights_tale_edward_the_black_prince/) by u/serMontagu. It would have been hard for his competitors not to know his face, given that they'd fought alongside him in the Hundred Years War with Edward routinely leading contingents of armies, and sometimes entire armies. They would have interacted a lot; in battle, at banquets and feasts and other courtly functions, and of course at other tournaments. The odds of other noblemen recognising him by just his face would have been very high. 

London always had a special relationship with the crown. Kings were coronated there, the city was officially the possession of the king (though in practise it was self-governing), and although the relationship between the city council and the king had at times been very difficult (Richard II had revoked the city charter and they threw a massive party to try and get him to give it back) it was pretty good during The Black Prince's lifetime. The Black Prince enjoyed London; he visited the city frequently, held parades there when he came home from battle victorious, and it's where he eventually died. His father enjoyed it more, which meant he was a common sight at special events. 

In 1359, Edward III and Edward the Black Prince hosted a tournament in London. This was a three day affair to mark a royal wedding, and seems to have been done to emphasise the strong relationship between the city and the royal family. So when the mayor and the sheriff opened the tournament, they got up in front of the crowd and the crowd went wild, recognising the pair for who they really were. They were *not* the mayor and sheriff, but Edward III and Edward the Black Prince. The crowd was expecting them, of course - this was to mark a royal wedding and it would be a bit odd if the king wasn't there - but that he was participating and pretending to be the mayor was apparently a surprise. Then the noblemen fought in costume as various city officials before the jubilant crowd. They probably recognised Edward III more than they did The Black Prince, because Edward III spent more time in the city, and it was far from the first London tournament he had hosted. 

But more generally speaking, probably not. Being recognised was a problem pretty specific to Edward III and his son, and even then only at tournaments or in the one city they happened to spend a lot of time. Medieval kings couldn't put their image out there in the form of any mass media - the closest they had to that was a sermon and it's quite hard to describe the exact details of someone's face good enough to be recognisable. They could recognise that they were noblemen of some kind from their clothes and equipment and  their entourage (if they were travelling with one), but unless they were announced then they were somewhat unlikely to be recognised specifically as royalty. If the nobleman was local a peasant might be able to recognise their coat of arms too, which was the only recognisable symbol individual nobles could display publicly. By this point the royal family was adopting [this](https://cdn10.bigcommerce.com/s-hhbbk/products/1707/images/50881/HIST0131__81547.1580482190.1280.1280.png?c=2) as a symbol, so if they were waving that about they'd be seen, but then that was the point of it. 

So to be able to look at a crowd of people and go 'hey, there's the king!' was not a level of familiarity your average peasant would have had. It just so happens that the two times he goes in disguise in the film are perhaps the only circumstances in which the real Edward might have been recognised by appearance.

"I can speak specifically to some of the Jewish practices.  This is a very wide ranging topic and I will only touch on the most salient religious aspects of these practices.  There are other sociological aspects that I can't speak much to.

The main religious reason that orthodox Jews dress the way they do is because of the prohibition of Khukat Hagoyim (""the ways/traditions of the nations""), from Leviticus 20:23:
>Do not follow the traditions of the nation that I expel from before you, for they did all of these and I was disgusted with them.

This is not just about dress, but in all practices of non-Jews.  That Jews are only allowed to adopt non-Jewish practices if they are for a discernible practical purpose (that doesn't otherwise violate Jewish law).  This is spelled out in [Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 178](http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.178.1?lang=bi).

The important part here is the explanation of The Rama (16th century).  The Rama's decisions are what most Ashkenazi (broadly, northern European) Jews follow.  He draws on two different understandings of this mitzvah (commandment):

* from The Maharik: the prohibition is on things that are seen as immoral (e.g. at the time, only immodest women wore red)
* from The Ran: specifying that the practice has to have a known practical purpose is to prevent Jews from accidentally doing something idolatrous (e.g. throwing spilt salt over one's shoulder)

However, The Rama states, if something that has a known origin and a practical purpose (e.g. tradesmen's clothing such as a doctor's coat), it's permissible.  There were however strong customs as to what different religions wore in different regions, and it would be assumed that everyday dress followed these customs, that if a Jew went out to buy clothing that only Calvinists wore, that they were in violation of this mitzvah.  In modern times this only comes up with clothing for particular religious practices (nun's habit, monk's orange robe, etc.) but used to be very prevalent for regular old people. (this will be relevant later)

In the 20th century, non-hasidic orthodox Jews generally follow the rulings of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein.  He ruled more toward The Maharik on clothing, that so long as you aren't dressing out of a desire to imitate gentiles and the clothing is modest, then you can assume that you can wear it; that in modern times no one makes clothing and says ""ah yes, this clothing is just for gentiles"".  People make clothing for everyone.  Reb Moshe is why modern and centrist orthodox Jews will wear jeans, etc. while most hasidic Jews will follow the more stringent opinion that includes The Ran along with the (usually more stringent) opinion of the rebbe of their particular hasidic dynasty.

I hinted at this earlier, but there is also the issue of tzniut/tznius (modesty).  Tzniut is about being modest not just in the way Jews look but in the way that they act.  So while orthodox Jewish men are technically allowed to wear certain clothes, they don't because other men don't.  If one person wore a flashy suit but no one else did, then that would be considered not tzniut.  In many communities, the standard of dress for men is a black suit (maybe a deep charcoal), and if someone within that community wore a non-black suit it would be seen as immodest and vain.

In particular to hasidic sects, their whole outfit is usually particular to their dynasty.  Within each dynasty they wear a particular type of black hat, a particular shtreimel, a particular bekishe, gartel, etc.  How the specific customs of dress came to be adopted by each of these dynasties is a rabbit hole I haven't jumped down (and there's a dearth of available English literature on these things; it's mostly in Yiddish).

All of these practices probably have just as much to do with identity as anything else.  With general orthodox populations too, identity and assimilation are big areas of concern, and distinctive dress is a way of promoting and reenforcing one's identity.  Orthodox Jews know this and talk about it in explicit terms regularly, so it's not some underlying sociological phenomenon; it very much underlies and overlays.  There is a lot penned on this aspect of the subject, but I am unfamiliar with it and won't conjecture further here.

"The realization that Britain being alone after the fall of France is a myth is not a new phenomenon. Much of what I am writing now borrows from the 2018 A.B. Emden Lecture at St. Edmund’s Hall, Oxford, by Professor David Edgerton who talked about this very idea. Though with all enduring ideas, the popular perception of fortress Britain in WWII is in part true and its more mythical elements comes from a distortion of history due to the passing of time. To put it briefly, there are two main elements to the question you are posing. First, is the idea of Britain being alone historically accurate given their massive empire? And secondly, if that is not the case, how did we come to see an isolated Britain in the early parts of WWII as the prevailing popular history narrative?

&#x200B;

To address the first question of how overmatched Britain was after the fall of France, perhaps the first thing we should address is that while the Empire was a source of strength for Britain, it was also a massive liability. While Britain could draw upon manpower and materiel from its globe-spanning empire, it also meant that it had defence obligations that spanned a global empire. In this sense, the Empire was very much a double-edged sword since channelling forces from overseas into specific theatres would leave them at best underdefended. The root of this problem can trace itself back to the First World War. Even though Britain was fighting alongside France in a very similar strategic position, it still cost them an inordinate amount of money and lives to prosecute the war. While this did not cripple Britain economically, it was such a great strain that it evaporated any future political will to maintain that level of spending unless it was absolutely necessary. This was reflected in their inter-war defence arrangements which saw them become begrudging signatories to the Washington Naval Conference and following that other disarmament and arms limitation treaties. The curbing of military spending in the interwar period drastically affected the disposition of British and Commonwealth forces as spending was largely limited to as the least possible amount which was deemed to be acceptable. This was manifest in the “10 Year Rule” where the government maintained after WWI that it would not increase defence spending for the next decade. 

&#x200B;

The Royal Navy perhaps suffered the most under these budgetary cutbacks since their responsibilities were the largest. The sheer size of the Empire meant that the Royal Navy was essential in defending far-flung territories and maintaining lines of communication with them. This is an essential component in order to realize any advantage of an Empire. In the event of a major conflict, troops would have to be redeployed or mobilized from the Dominions and resources raw or manufactured would have to all be transported via shipping. In addition to this, the Royal Navy would have to direct combat enemy fleets and undertake their own offensive action. The Royal Navy was after the war reduced to a “One Power Standard” which meant that it was only maintained to be as large as their nearest competitor which was the United States. This meant that the Royal Navy was stretched incredibly thin, even considering that a conflict with the United States was relatively unlikely. The strategic position also changed by the early 1930s with Japan becoming a significant threat to the Asia-Pacific region of the British Empire. This combined with the naval build-up in Germany and Italy meant that the Royal Navy was forced to draw up their initial war plans relying on the French fleet to contest the Mediterranean so that they could maintain adequate forces in the Far East and Atlantic. 

&#x200B;

This whole plan fell apart with the swift defeat of France in 1940 which created at the very least an uncomfortable strategic position for Britain. While scholars like Richard Overy had made a very convincing case that Britain was not in danger of being invaded, they were very much on the backfoot even though they were not at the brink of the defeat. Britain by this point was also mobilizing its entire Empire for War. Commonwealth and Exiled forces from continental Allied nations were taking part in the Battle of Britain and in North Africa, ANZAC and Indian troops had been deployed. The United States while being official neutral was by this point clearly sympathetic to the Allied cause, supplying them with Lend-Lease material. 

&#x200B;

The difficulty in the British position came from the dispersion of the resources they were drawing on which were relatively isolated from the British Isles. This meant that controlling in the Atlantic, North Africa and the Mediterranean was essential to maintain supply lines but were themselves difficult to supply from Britain where a majority of war materiel was being manufactured. All this is to say that the British position was precarious, but they were not at risk of being defeated outright. This is, of course, said with the benefit of hindsight. While it was apparent by the end of 1940 that the Germans were unable to mount a successful invasion of Britain, there were still fears of it and it tied down a considerable amount of resources. In addition, while the U-Boat threat and even potentially the loss of North Africa would not necessarily be death blows to Britain, there was considerable worry that these losses would compel them to surrender. More as a matter of losing the political will to carry on the war than the sheer untenability of their position.

&#x200B;

What did spell disaster for the British was the Japanese entry into the war which captured the entirety of Southeast Asia as well as threatening an invasion of India and Australia. Again, with hindsight, it is clear that the Japanese had overextended themselves and their invasion of Burma was the highwater mark of their military capability. However, at the time the situation appeared to be incredibly dire having swiftly lost the Malayan Peninsular in a shocking campaign, Darwin suffering an air raid in what seemed to be a prelude to invasion, as well as the British fleet in the Indian Ocean suffering significant damage due to a Japanese raid. Again, the situation is similar to that of earlier in 1941 in that the British position was precarious but they were not close to being destroyed. They had suffered significant losses but the sheer size of the Empire itself also meant it was difficult to physically deal a crippling blow. Fortunately for the British, the Japanese entry into the war also drew the United States into the conflict which soundly tipped the long-term balance of power in favour of the Allies."
"Can you put up a map? I've found that ""blocks"" can refer to distances of several miles, at least when news articles talk about events in DC being just ""blocks"" from the White House or Capitol, when they may be miles away. Having a map may help determine if the answer is that there was something extraordinary about their neighborhood, city, or country."
"This is an interesting aspect of the accusations- why wasn't the sword turned on them?  In a select few cases, it was but there were outs.  Mary Warren made accusations and stopped.  Once she did and people noticed that she stopped suffering witchcraft afflictions while others continued to face spectral torment.  The accusers turned on her.  With no other option, Warren confessed to signing the devil's book to end the torture but now as a confessor, she broke her pact with Satan and suffered afflictions again and once again named suspects.  If you stopped accusing, you were accused.  

&#x200B;

But then why not target Ann Jr.?  You couldn't.  The narrative was set as to who had credible accusations.  The Salem Village girls started so many of them, but as the afflictions and accusations spread, girls in other towns needed the Salem accusers to support their claims.  Andover had more accused suspects than Salem, but the accusations that went anywhere from Andover were the ones that the Salem accusers joined.  Arrests happened, but accusations were made believable if Ann Putnam Jr, Abigail Williams, Mercy Lewis, Elizabeth Hubbard, and the rest of that group supported it.  These girls were stuck in this situation where they had to keep accusing, but at the same time, no one could touch them.

&#x200B;

Accusations created power.  Once the accusers held that power, they couldn't be targeted.  There was one point where Mercy Lewis' name came up as a specter seen by a confessor, but the magistrates overlooked it.  It was dropped.  To question the accusations made by Ann Jr. would mean to question the actions already taken.  There was no going back.  The accusers and officials had strong interests in continuing and little incentive to stop."
">Do you know why Indian produced candles burned for some much longer than those in the metropole?

Argh! I knew some clever commenter was going to bring this up. I nearly put aside an asterisk to go off about it until I realised it would be completely tangential.

>Was the beeswax somehow treated differently, or were they produced in different shapes?

Amin unfortunately does not go into great detail about the candles themselves because, in that passage, he mentions them only in reference to a letter written by a British officer who described the impressive luxury and technological accomplishments of the Mughal court in a letter to home. The reason could be myriad as it appears to have been a brief fad: the particular climate could have allowed the candles to burn slower (then why weren't they used more frequently?), the mixture of wax could have yielded a superior product (then why didn't they become the British standard?), or there could be some other unenumerated reason.

I was also intrigued by this passage because the trip between India and Britain was famously described as torturous before the advent of the steel-hulled passenger ship. This was in part due to the heat, which was described as unbearable. It was also due, however, to the proliferation of cockroaches in wood hulled vessels that allegedly covered almost every surface below deck. Passengers reported that they would wake up to their fingers covered in small marks where a roach had made a snack (sorry I hope this isn't too gory!) of the dead skin on their hands and their eyelashes gnawed off.

I desperately wish I had a source for that last bit, but I only recall it from a primary source I once read in a 19th century newspaper wherein a woman described her journey from Southampton to Bombay/Mumbai."
"Fascinating! So is it sensible to assume that presidents refused guards as a way of saying ""even though I maybe in danger, I am a servant of the people and I need to move freely amongst them""?

The president today will go to those very well planned events that make it look like he's amongst the people, or they'll have events at the White House... but fundamentally, it's very much interaction at arms length from what I can see.

Like, cool, the president is eating breakfast at a diner... but everything has been planned and vetted.

In the past, were they more casual with such things? Like, did they actively try and make it seem as though they're a public servant / ""commoner""?"
"And now onto Part III -- generally making sense of medical history. My caveat here will be that some of this is my opinion, and on these topics I have a tendency to be quite opinionated.

&#x200B;

So I am a practicing physician (both in the US and in Botswana), so it is with great affection when I say that one of the greatest impediments to understanding medical history has been doctors themselves. For the longest time (roughly until WW2), medical history has been in the hands of its practitioners, and they largely painted a picture of gradual progress by (largely) upper class, white men. Since then, medical history (and the history of science in general -- I don't want to suggest that this is unique to medicine) has expanded dramatically. But doctors -- including the doctors who write review articles on historical topics in medical journals -- have largely not kept up with this expanded historiography. Comically, some articles on medical history read chapters from an 1890s text book I own, with just extra content added on once the 20th century rolled through.

&#x200B;

This is why I appreciate Foucault, even while realizing his many shortcomings as an historian (though I don't think that was what he was going for). I'll give you an example. James Lind is often credited with performing the first randomized trial in history, using oranges and lemons to cure scurvy. So a few years ago when I sat down to actually read it ([http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/72991](http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/72991) if you want to -- though I don't recommend it, other than the relevant trial), how surprised was I that six paragraphs were dedicated to his ""practice-changing"" experiment, with hundreds and hundreds of pages devoted to humoral and dietary explanations, and descriptions of scurvy that are unrecognizable to a modern physician. 

&#x200B;

When I was younger and starting my flirtation with medical history, I actually said something like, ""I just don't GET doctors from the 18th century,"" in contrast to, say, Rene Laennec, who wrote his On Mediate Auscultation not even a fifty years later, but for some reason seems like it comes from fundamentally the same era as myself.  The reason is, I would argue now, that Laennec and I share many fundamental assumptions about the relationship between, man, physician, disease, and nature, which are not shared with Lind. 

&#x200B;

This isn't made any easier by the medical tendency to remain ""ahistorical"" and continue to reuse old words with new, unconsciously loaded definitions (my favorite example is ""sepsis"" which I've written about before on AskHistorians). I mean, some of my residents still use these and have no idea -- the best example is ""bleeding diathesis;"" diathesis meaning a hereditary tendency towards something, which was largely used in the debate about whether or not TB was hereditary (""a consumptive diathesis""). 

&#x200B;

I'm not a real historian, and it's impossible for me to ""shut off"" my medical gaze when I'm reading notes and treatises by old doctors. But whenever reading my predecessors, it's essential to try and understand their intellectual context and potential biases. This is the huge challenge of paleopathology, and why a variety of methods are now used (for example, the articles I cited, which used both pedigrees and portraits). Modern paleopathology uses anything from genetic analyses of SNPs inside living viruses, to PCR amplification of material inside human teeth, to CT scans of mummies."
"I think the problem may rest on not having the appropriate questions to ask. Why not have these historians post what they think is interesting from their fields anyways? Kind of like a TIL, but the historian would title the post in the form of a question and then respond to themselves? That would also get other people to ask them for more details.

I love this subreddit and am always fascinated with the knowledge contained in many posts."
"We honestly get a lot of great answers here, as we did with this, but this is a brilliant question as well. As you say, I think it is something I certainly never stopped to consider before."
"Although I'll swing back to the circumstances around 1876, to start off, I'm going to turn this question on its head and look at why voter turnout *declined* in the elections following. If you look at [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/rjFrb) you can see that while 1876 was the highpoint, it wasn't exactly an anomaly, and voter turnout was consistently high in the elections preceding it. It sticks out because, although the drop wasn't *immediately* afterwards, it certainly preceded the continuing decline in voter turnout that would mark the next half-century.

So why did voting decline in that period? Well, one of the most simple reasons to look at is Jim Crow. While under Reconstruction, black men (women being generally deprived of the vote) could, for the most part, go to the polls and exercise their right to vote, this began to change after Reconstruction was ended (not to say it didn't happen before, just not as effectively), and the Redeemer governments worked through various means to disenfranchise vast swathes of voters in the American South. The effect of this can't be underrated. While in the 1876 election the South saw turnout roughly comparable to the rest of the country, at 75 percent, vote suppression methods such as literacy tests not to mention outright fraud, saw the turnout decline to 46 percent at the turn of the century. By the 1924 election, *19 percent* of those theoretically eligible to vote were actually showing up at the polls. And to be sure, while the primary target was black voters, many poorer, illiterate whites were disenfranchised too, despite ""loopholes"" to grandfather many of them in. In Louisiana, for instance, while 90 percent of black voters were barred from the polls, 60 percent of whites were as well. While Jim Crow should absolutely be understood as primarily a racial regime, it was quite oligarchical as well, with power being concentrated in the hands mostly of upper-class whites, who wanted to share it with no one.

This allows us to circle back somewhat though to look at 1876, and why it would be slightly above the average of the time though. During the Reconstruction era there were *real efforts* to mobilize poor voters of both races by the Radical Republicans. The example I'm most familiar with was that led by Mahone in Virginia whose Readjuster movement controlled the state for a brief time in the late 1870s-early'80s, propelled by populist support from a coalition of black voters and poor whites. I won't spend to much time on him as I've written about him before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6fent8/did_longstreet_and_other_confederates_really_seek/dihn6ym/?context=3) but the short of it is that in the post-war era, but before Jim Crow laws took hold, we can see a lot of political agitation that struck at the white Democratic establishment in the South that was attempting to reclaim power, and that *for a time* they enjoyed some successes. The 1876 election in particular we can look at as a watershed, with both sides of the argument over Reconstruction seeing heavy stakes. And of course Tilden won the popular vote, but lost anyways, as part of a deal that did end Reconstruction anyways. That cessation meant the evaporation of the Federal protections that allowed those insurgent political movements to compete on a roughly level playing field. Changes weren't immediate, and varied state by state - in Virginia for instance the Readjusters remained in power until 1883, when race riots days before the election were used by the Democrats to stoke voter fears - but it nevertheless meant that the suppression of the black vote and the poor white vote was able to start, a process which wasn't immediate, and took time to take full effect.

It can also be said that while Jim Crow was unique to the American South, similar political tactics were not unknown throughout the country, just in different ways. In the Northern and Western states, turnout had dropped to 55 percent by the 1920 election, after all, and while it cannot be blamed on *institutional* barriers such as those in the South, responses to political mobilization by immigrants and lower-class groups *outside* the South by political elites saw attempts at ""demobilizing what they judged to be the least desirable components of the electorate"". They may not have been legally barring them from the polls, but through the late 1800s and early 20th century, they certainly were attempting to dissuade them from showing up.

So as I have tickets for Thor at 10, and my wife is giving me *the look*, I'll wrap this up with a quick summation. In short, voter turnout in the United States was consistently fairly high up until the 1880s. The apex of turnout in 1876 isn't exactly an anomaly if we look at the turnouts in votes around it, such as 1868 at 78.1%, or 1880 at 79.4%, but it does coincide with a period in American history rife with political upheaval, not just the American South, still on the tail end of Reconstruction, but nationwide, with Populist movements in the ascendant. The end of the century, and the early 1900s, thus provide a stark contrast, as attempts both at institutional vote suppression, as well as simple 'demobilization' of cohorts of voters, lead to a decline in turnout nationwide.

">I am a bit confused as to why they would not want warmer houses however

That's a complicated issue.  No, I wouldn't say everyone in Japan was automatically culturally on board with Wabi Sabi, romantic suffering or anything like that.  The pursuit of aesthetic priorities in your buildings and lifestyle are the realm of the well-off all over the world.  For poorer folks, being cold was just a reality of practice more often than not.  To be warm in the winter, you need two things: a source of heat, and insulation.  In the 1500's your source of heat was limited to either open combustion (coal or wood) and body heat (people and animals both depending on where in the world you are).  Insulation comes in a variety of forms.  Earthy insulations would be brick or dirt walls and rely on thickness/mass to regulate temperature changes.  These can be very effective but also have challenges to overcome.  They are also very stiff and will crumble in an earthquake.  You can have light insulation in the form of things like hay or wool inside of a wood-framed wall.  That is a lot easier and more flexible to use, but is less effective and relied on having those resources on hand in abundance.  You could also have solid wood walls, which are similar to the earth-mass but with wood.  Think like a log cabin, with big solid trees as the walls.  When I look up traditional Norwegian architecture on google for example, I see stuff like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_architecture_in_Norway#/media/File:Tronderlaane_in_Oppdal_Norway.jpg) which uses either squared off logs or thicker planks as an exterior.  The thicker the wood, the more insulative it would be; but also the more rigid.  

Traditional Japanese framed homes like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/78/7d/40787daa1b9a70f63b357508365ebe96.gif) needed to avoid rigid walls as much as possible.  By building an open frame out of wood with [complicated joinery](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/588221318419c28b7ce4c7b5/1489014140454-78ANU547MYY0J4NFTMHM/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIt7oCWRN5YpTkNaA8eivFUUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcGcFgX7hyzNsigxFGiNtVehnEzP5GqSYBBMQrZ1lMF3_EY4nsxwGJsz5V6daraeNW/_MG_7880.jpg) that wouldn't separate even under variable stresses, your house had a good chance of keeping together.  But that also severely limited your options for insulation.

But whether you lived in Norway or Japan in the 1500's, the reality was your degree of comfort and insulation were incredibly poor compared to even modest buildings today.  Most structures would have a lot of air gaps, indoor fires needed a place for smoke to escape through, and glass was hard to come by.  They mostly dealt with it through a combination of tolerance, dressing warmly, and burning more fuel indoors to overcome the cold.  In Japan specifically, I mentioned *Kotatsu* as a solution for staying warm, which were incredibly efficient but of limited mobility, and coal braziers can give off a surprising amount of heat in an individual room as well.   

There were differences between North and South for sure.  I'm not as versed on more Northern styles admittedly.  An example of that (and something you might like to see more broadly) can be found at [this wiki apge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_partitions_of_traditional_Japanese_architecture#Fixed_(walls)) which discusses the types of walls used in Japan.  That section is a listing of the various types of fixed/solid walls which would have more in common with European architecture.  The A-frame with the thatched walls they show would be much warmer and has similar examples across the world.  You'll also see lath/plaster and wood battens (both technologies used worldwide) indicated.  Those two weren't as insulative as thatch or heavy earth/masonry walls."

"The interesting thing here is it wasn't a far-future reading of the event -- the conservatives really read it as blood in the water, and as I mentioned, Reagan had to add the clarification himself.

Reagan was generally upset Democrats kept grabbing the majority of the union vote, he didn't think union ideas were necessarily in opposition to Republican ones. 

Some of his hopefulness was in contradiction with his policy goals, though, and he to tweak some of his ideas when going for votes during Reagan/Carter; for instance, he was strongly against OSHA originally but had to soften his message. 

(He eventually still did some OSHA gutting in office -- Carter passed some last-minute regulations and Reagan nixed them, for instance -- but at least he didn't work at abolishing it entirely. It wasn't as bad as what happened with the Secretary of the Interior where Reagan appointed James Watt who is arguably one of the worst appointees ever, crippling nearly every program, and he only got fired when he got caught using the N-word.)"

"Yes, most of it, but there are bits that are probably older than the *Iliad*. The *Iliad* reached roughly its present form around the first half of the 600s BCE; there are linguistic forms and poetic formulas that are older than that date, but equally, there are chunks of some Hebrew books that are older -- the best candidates are proto-*Isaiah* and *Hosea*. {*Edit:* also *Amos* and *Micah*.} And there are one or two passages which are even older, notably the 'song of the sea' in *Exodus* 15.1-18, which could in principle date back to the 2nd millennium BCE; and less certainly (as I understand it) the song of Deborah in *Judges* 5.2-31, and the song of Lamech in *Genesis* 4.23-24.

(Also, perhaps of interest, there's a literary trope that appears in both the *Iliad* and *Deuteronomy*, as well as also in another 7th century BCE text, the Assyrian succession treaty of Esarhaddon: the motif of 'bronze sky' and 'iron ground', representing a harsh, brutal environment. The *Iliad* and the Esarhaddon treaty are around the same date; *Deuteronomy*'s date is less certain, but is usually put a handful of decades later.)"
"We are not obliged to bend over backwards to make sense of Peterson's words. He is jumbling together various half-understood scraps of common knowledge (about the history of the book trade, the cultural prominence of the Bible, and the printing press) in a way that cannot be disentangled without basically rewriting his speech for him. Whatever we may generously decide he must have been trying to say, what he actually said was neither coherent nor true. The obvious response is not to try our best to distill some kernel of truth from the word salad, but rather to conclude that he doesn't know what he's talking about, and move on."
"I wouldn't be surprised if there are more swimming events that Phelps competes in than ancient events as a whole. There were three fighting events: boxing, wrestling, and pankration (a combination of the two, maybe a bit like MMA). Two riding events: chariot and horeseracing. Four different running events (including the race in armor), and the pentathalon. So I think it is a *bit* unfair to Leonidas.

The one that comes to mind is Phayllos of Kroton, who leapt so far he cleared the pit and broke his leg. As the pit was about fifteen meters long, this is well beyond the 8.9 Mike Powell managed in Barcelona. That being said, the sheer size of this leap has made plenty of people a bit leery, and it does seem to be straining against the limits of the possible, and so there is a bit of a debate over what the long jump was actually like. One possibility is that the weighted [halteres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halteres_(ancient_Greece\)) that the athletes apparently held while jumping was used in some way to add lift or effect the center of gravity, but modern testing hasn't really provided a comparable effect. The simpler explanation is that it was just a triple jump, which makes 15 meters extremely impressive but well within the 18.3 meters that is the current record.

If you want to read more, Leuven has a great little site about the Olympics, I linked [Phyllos' page](http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/tp018en.html).

EDIT: it is worth noting that event athletics became proffessionalized to an extent during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were enough places hosting games that it was possible for a talented athlete to make a comfortable living going from Games to Games and surviving off of the prize money. By contrast the competitors of the classical games were young aristocratic amateurs, so I find it pretty likely that the quality of competition was much higher in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, but authors primarily primarily talked about the classical games."

"I just want to point out that you're leaving out an important fact about the Conquest of Tenochtitlan and that is that Cortes and the Spanish razed the city block by block to ensure that the Aztec could not hide and ambush them. There was nothing left of the city to preserve by the time they got to the city center. And as you say, the buildings in the city center were dismantled down to their foundations to construct things like the cathedral that now borders one side of the zocalo."
"(1) To my knowledge, poorer peasants did not hire wet nurses. In fact, it was a possible temporary job for lower-class women. They'd be hired into aristocratic households, or those of middle-class artisans with social aspirations, or--least desirable of all--by foundling hospitals. 

Being hired by a well-to-do family could actually pay off down the road, through social connections, and Rebecca Winer points out that some women could use wet nursing as a temporary escape from a bad home life of their own. (Not that the job was a guaranteed easy path--employers in late medieval Europe were encouraged to use physical chastisement on unruly servants for the purpose of ""correction,"" as long the violence was in control and with a purpose :/ ).

(2) I'm not sure if the Church as a whole took a position on forcing enslaved women to work as wet nurses in the Middle Ages beyond prohibiting Christian families from using Jewish or Muslim wet nurses, and vice versa. Those bans--so frequently repeated, in Iberia, in Italy, in Ashkenaz (where the issue would not have been slaves, but employees or friends swapping breast-feeding responsibilities on holidays)--seem to me like tacit approval of the practice in general.

There is a decent amount of material from individual theologians and preachers with an interest in restricting and controlling women who served as wet nurses, although this would not have applied solely to enslaved women. In fact, hired servants, and even mothers themselves, were frequently the real target.

Bernardino of Siena, a *wildly* popular ""(literal) bonfire of the vanities"" traveling preacher in the 15th century, had a lot more to say about women's excesses than chessboards and makeup. He preached that women should confine their hired wet nurses to the house at all times with their children, to (a) keep watch of the baby (b) avoid acting immorally in society and thus affecting the infant badly. (Fathers were warned about bringing ""evil servant women"" into the household for fear of corrupting their children). 

Of course, Bernardino's actual point here has nothing to do with wet nurses. He is really telling Italian *mothers* that they need to spent their time being mothers and not independent shrewish women doing dangerous things like buying food or having friends.

In general, though, the Church's priority was religious purity and order."

"Well, in the case of this specific group of Catalan mercenaries, their eventual fate was to raid their way over the course of a few years down to Thebes and Athens, which they then conquered from the Frankish rulers there in the Duchy of Athens.

In a secondary and admittedly dated source on the matter, it is described that the Almogavers essentially became rulers and administrators of the area around Athens and Thebes, where them and their descendants remained for a few generations. 

""For a period of three generations the Catalan Grand Company and its descendants were to live as a settled commnity heirs to the feudal system of the Burgundian dukes."" (citation at the end)

So in a sense, they did retire, but their retirement was to become rulers and administrators of a chunk of Greece. 

Unfortunately, Muntaner did not continue with the company for the latter part of that conquest, so his chronicle doesn't provide as much information at that point. He eventually left the Company to serve the Kingdom of Mallorca (which was soon after incorporated into Aragon I believe).

Interestingly, my secondary source also makes mention of the fact that Muntaner had himself acquired so much wealth  by the time that he came into trouble with a French knight named Thibaut de Cepoy, that Thibaut assumed he must've embezzled it!

""As a careful campaigner Muntaner had amassed, in perfectly honest fashion, 25,000 ounces of gold, as well as valuable ornaments and cloths. All were stolen by the rapacious Venetians and, as we shall learn, were never returned, though his grand-daughter managed to get back a tenth part of the lost property some forty years later."" (pg. 106)

So in the case of Muntaner, it seems his own large amount of wealth didn't last, although it certainly seems he did fine serving in Mallorca after that point.

Sorry to not have more specific answers about exactly how exactly the Almogavers used their wealth! I know I only somewhat answered the question, so I apologize.

"Great answer, but for anyone wanting to read Tim Pat Coogan's book I would urge you to read it with skepticism. It's more of a revealing primary source than authoritive historical research. Coogan, despite his pretentions to be a historian, would more accurately be described as a journalist and populiser of history. He has a habit of making unsubstantiated claims such as Eamon Dev Valera had autism. For anyone intrigued about this I would encourage you to look into the arguements Diarmaid Ferriter and Tim Pat Coogan had in the pages of Irish newspapers about their respective biographies of Eamon Dev Valera."
"This was not typical of the English Civil War or 17th century pike combat at all. By this period the ""push of pike"" was widely characterized as a very rare and very brief occurrence. This was when more than half of the typical infantry battalion would be armed with muskets, and often ended up being much more than that due to a lack of willing, good quality pikemen.

A battalion would be formed with pikemen in the middle and two ""wings"" of unarmored musketeers on each side. If they came into melee with the enemy, then the shot would either have to fall onto each other, fighting with swords and musket butts, or else step back slightly continue firing volley after volley point blank into the enemy flanks. The devastating effect of firearms at such short ranges meant that soldiers armed only with pikes definitely had an incentive to press into the enemy and decide the issue as quickly as possible or else run away before the shot had time to start reloading their weapons. This combined with the decreasing frequency of armor during the period made a very quick, bloody conclusion to any melees fairly easy to achieve. I wrote a bit more about it in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6jd1pu/charges_did_they_get_scarier/) as well as [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7j6m6t/the_effectiveness_of_hand_to_hand_combat_or_how/dr4pkcw/) with u/Hergrim.

It was already widely accepted by this time that the vast majority of casualties were now being caused by bullets, and that most infantry engagements were being decided by the amount of damage inflicted by gunfire at a distance, long before either side got close enough to fight hand-to-hand. During the 30 years war, soldiers sometimes even joked that anyone who kills a pikeman has killed an innocent man. Experienced military theorists and generals remained largely unconcerned about this however. As Robert Barret put it, he shot might be the ""furie of the field"", but the pikes were still ""the strength of the battell"" and "". . . the one without the other is weakened the better halfe of their strength.""

It was often likened to how the ancient Romans and Greeks relied on their heavy infantry to break the enemy, then left the pursuit and execution of fleeing enemies up to their cavalry and lightly armored velites. Musketeers on their own and out in the open were not expected to be able to resist a determined charge by enemy cavalry, pikemen, or even better-motivated musketeers. But as long as their nearby body of pikes remained unbroken, they could always retreat to safety underneath or behind the pikes and then potentially reform. But if the pikemen broke and ran, then any remaining musketeers could be easily driven off the field. Hence "". . . for hee is but a foolish shot, that shooteth at, or among light skirmishers, where he may discharge vpon the body of his enemies battell, which standes thick together, and is a fayre marke to shoot at; for the armed pikes once ouerthrowen, which is the strength of the field, the victorie by all likelyhood is like to ensue."" 

Even if they never impaled a single man or horse, steadfast pikemen could still be credited with keeping the army in the fight. Especially in larger battles when positioning and maneuvering was most important, pikemen were the key to taking and holding ground. Even when faced by heavy cavalry armed with pistols and carbines, a disciplined charge by pikemen would be almost certain to force the horsemen to retreat and surrender their position."

# Preface: To resist, or not to resist, that is the question

You’re a French waiter at a nice outdoor café near the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Every day, the Parisian elite gather at your café to drink overpriced coffee, exchange gossip, shoo away inquisitive pigeons, and complain about the government. No, this is not *Emily in Paris*, but 1940s France. The Germans have broken through the Maginot Line. The poor French boys who defended the Dunkirk beachhead so valiantly are now in captivity, abandoned by the fleeing British. De Gaulle? Who’s that? Half of France is now under German control, the other half administrated by the new French government at the spa resort of Vichy. The older cafegoers nod approvingly when they hear that Petain heads the Vichy government. The First World War hero will protect French interests and restore stability to the nation, you hear them say.

The German officers sit apart from the Parisians. Nobody is comfortable with their presence, you least of all. You consider yourself a patriot, and would have served in the army if not for a long-term foot injury. Their boisterousness gets on your nerves, and you only grow in anger as they call you over and try to place their orders in broken French. You have several options. You could join the French Resistance and listen in on their conversations. It feels like the morally right thing to do, but you have no idea how long the occupation will be and you don’t want to stress of always looking over your shoulder in fear of being caught by the Gestapo. Joining countryside guerrilla bands sounds romantic and dashing, but the thought of living hand to month, hunted constantly by the police and the paramilitary orders, has little appeal to an urbanite like you. On a smaller scale, you could carry out civil disobedience and refuse to serve German officers. You would be certainly sacked for doing so. How would you then feed your old mother and fund the school expenses of your younger brother? A new job would be hard to find, especially considering the hundreds of demobilised veterans applying for every single job opening. You could, of course, do nothing. You will rage against the Germans with all one’s heart, but smile outwardly as you take their orders. You feel guilty as you take their generous tips, but food prices are rising, and you need every franc you can get. Over time, you might even befriend the regular German patrons to your café. Are you collaborating? Yes, you are, but the cynic inside you replies: what else can one do?

# The Percentage

There has been some justifiable comments over the validity and source of the 10% quoted by the OP. My best guess would be that it comes from Robert O. Paxton’s *Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940-1944*, published in 1972, which argues a majority of the French population supported the Vichy government after its establishment in 1940. But Paxton’s argument is much more nuanced than just a number (and to my knowledge, Paxton never explicitly stated a percentage of 10% - happy to be corrected here).

Firstly, sources. The construction of public opinion remains difficult for historians – public polling is very much a modern phenomenon. As several other comments note, neither Germany nor Vichy France conducted polls on the level of the Mass Observation Project over in Britain. Nor can public opinion be determined through the reading of free press or public debate due to its suppression in Vichy France. For post-war historians, public opinion in occupied France remained an unsolvable mystery, and many chose to uncritically accept the Gaullist myth of widespread French resistance. Henri Michel, one of the foremost scholars in the 1950s and 1960s, could claim that “the French… had been, in their great majority, heroes, patriots, and victims.” Others, such as Robert Aron, relied on the post-war trials and testimonies from former Vichy officials to construct a ‘Sword and Shield’ theory that sympathised with the Vichy position. ‘Sword and Shield’ supporters argued that while De Gaulle served as France’s sword overseas, Petain’s government served as the shield that protected the French from German depravities."
"Fairly recently, to the extent that this question is what a number of articles posted to the sleepy subreddit r/IRStudies try to answer in a slightly altered form: what drives peace, and why does it seem that in the past seventy or so years, the international system has largely peaceful, devoid of wars of conquest as indeed you ask? 

Is this even a History question, or is this an International Relations question? I will say that I believe this question is unanswerable from a historian’s perspective: What constitutes a conquest across societies through history? What does it mean when a conquest is “Acceptable?” (I would argue that a conquest is never acceptable in the eyes of the conquered) In antiquity, across Europe and Asia, when nomadic peoples raided and extracted tribute from more stationary societies, was this conquest? What of the Empires which relied off of tribute extracted from peripheral peoples in order to enrich the homeland? Did the ancient empires understand conquest as we do, given the emergence of concepts of “Universal Empire” (present in some form both Ancient Rome and China)? If we want to fish for a specific example, when in the Early Modern Era the Kings of France or Spain sliced off the ruling dynasties of Italian states like Milan and Naples without laying hand on the underlying institutions, was this really a conquest? These are all questions which can be answered in a variety of ways, and these answers will have a different impact in our response. Building on my last example, I could offer a [multi-part answer exclusively on the French and Spanish ""conquest"" of Italy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3l9jox/when_spain_controlled_parts_of_modernday/cv7eqh3/) and we would still need to dig deeper into why or how decision-makers found that conflict ""acceptable"" (or ""unacceptable""). 

So what I'm getting at is that there is no “real” answer to your question, but I can try to first inject some nuance in the notion of the historic “acceptability” of war in the western european history, and then veer onto a conclusion that will necessarily look at how an answer to this question might differ between various traditions of international relations theory. I'd also point out that anyone who might want to reply or offer their own answer from other perspectives is of course welcome to do so (I only point this out as the question has gotten a lot of upvotes, and I wouldn’t want my reply to be taken as the only possible response). There might, for example, be a parallel answer to be had as pertains to the history of philosophy on the legitimacy of war and conquest (be it philosophy in the Eastern, Western, or other world traditions). 

As pertains to modern notions of statehood and sovereignty, in the western tradition these ideas are generally said to have been first codified in the the Treaty of Westphalia at the end of the Thirty Years War. We can choose this point in time as the convenient first signal where the high politics of Europe sought to begin codifying what constituted acceptable interactions between sovereign states. But does this mean that the multitude of princes and diplomats, as well as the Venetian mediators, present in Osnabruk and Munster collectively had no notion of needing to ""Legitimize"" wars before this point? 

Not really. Historians stay away from generalizations, but one that I am confident in making is that war is always a costly, disruptive, and highly destructive endeavor, which meant that long before the Treaty of Westphalia was signed, even the most authoritative ruler was accustomed to expending energy to galvanize subjects into accepting (and participating in) the business of war (and this is true today as it was in the past — but spending too much time on this would be veering too far into the real of modern social science and away from history). From the descent of Emperor Frederick (the “Barbarossa”) into Italy, to Charles VIII of France sparking the Italian wars, serious time and energy was expended to justify and legitimize the undertaking of war (I hope you will forgive my natural tendency to skewer examples towards Italy and the Mediterranean). My point is that war, especially war for conquest, is not exactly a natural concern of the state under any definition of the social contract; the very act of embarking on war is itself delegitimizing. Therefore, the right to rule by inheritance or acclamation, the real or perceived need to halt a growing threat or stabilize a border, the exploitation of religious or historic differences (or similarities), and good old opportunism, were just some of the reasons periodically produced in order to legitimize a war to stakeholders (often in a variety of combinations). Sure, there were no mass propaganda drives and elaborate mechanisms of enfranchisement that are necessary to legitimize modern conflicts, but a restricted circle of the empowered does not mean the absence of stakeholders altogether. And even pre-modern stakeholders knew full well that war was destructive and damaging, in no way guaranteed to be offset by plunder, perceived glory, and conquests: in the aforementioned example of Emperor Frederick, the highly destructive bouts of fighting in Northern Italy he pursued not only had the effect of consuming the very resources he was hoping to lay claim on, but also weakened his position relative to his subjects in Germany, and also imparted an intergenerational scar on communities in Italy which would forever change their attitudes to government and power, especially imperial power. But the Emperor Frederick himself was only building on the canons set by his ancestor, Emperor Otto, who at a critical moment in western european history had felt more much more legitimized in strengthening the imperial bonds between Germany and Italy and not, say, between Germany and France. For every european war of conquest, we can find specific and unique reasons why its participants felt that what they were doing was indeed, “Acceptable.” If they didn’t, the war wouldn’t have happened. In my own area of expertise, I could delve into how even the most opportunistic and seemingly unjustified conflicts, such as the 13th century Sack of Constantinople, were perceived as perfectly legitimate by the people who triggered them. 

That is not to say pre-modern Europe was a peaceful place save for a few unique exceptions. Flimsy pretexts for the powerful to coerce the weak abounded. Opportunism was rife. Pretexts which today would be unacceptable, such as religion or colonialism, were instead seen as perfectly acceptable. But my point is that war almost never emerged exclusively for conquest’s sake. To the people involved, all the reasons listed above represented very serious justifications for conflict. And although I am focusing on pre-Westphalian Europe, post-Westphalian Europe was similarly constrained. Even at the height of the 19th century colonialism, justifications ranging from resource extraction, to a ""Civilizing Mission,"" to the need to defend the metropole by projecting power across the world, necessarily emerged to justify the colonization process. Likewise, the innumerable causes of First World War, and the iconic (for all the wrong reasons) propaganda and nationalism in the lead-up to the Second World War, coupled with the very fact that both conquests erupted into world conflicts amid a narrative of curtailing an expansive aggressor, indicate to us that the ""acceptability"" of these conflicts was far from a simple foregone conclusion. 

Does this mean my long-awaited answer to the question is that the roster of justifications for war has shrunk in the past seventy years? Maybe. I'll get into more detail in the second part to my question below, but we will have to veer into the world of International Relations theory. 

Why? I've answered questions comparing International Relations methodology to Historical approaches [in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9fijwx/what_do_historians_think_about_henry_kissingers/e5wx4g0/) which might interest you. In short, the fundamental difference is that while history is a liberal art which looks to examine and deliver insight into the causes and consequences of past events, international relations theory is instead a social science which seeks to deliver systematize truths. In other words, a historian won't have much to say about the concept of ""Open Conquest"" which you ask about, however they might have a lot to say about the justifications and drivers of a specific conquest (that the historian happens to know something about). An International Relations theorist, on the other hand, will have an enormous amount of things to say on your question on ""Open Conquest,"" even if they might not be entirely well-versed in the details of a specific conflict (or conquests, as in our case)."
"Yes, absolutely, we know of works which were destroyed, and not all of it was 'looted'. Many works in the Bode Museum (then known as the Kasier Friederich Museum) in Berlin were destroyed or badly damaged by Allied bombing, and subsequently stolen by the Red Army in 1945. These included paintings by Caravaggio, and an important self-portrait by Van Gogh. Likewise, many works in the Dresden museums were lost in the Allied firestorm of 1945.

"One thing I will point out is that the as was not the smallest form of currency. The as started out during the early days of the Republic as a single Roman pound of bronze, which declined over the years, but even so, there were fractions of it. There were 12 unciae(which lead to the modern word ""ounce"") to the as, and there were various fractional denominations in between such as the semis(6 unciae, half as), triens(4 unciae, third as), quadrans(3 unciae, quarter as), semuncia(half uncia, 1/24) and others at various times as well. As the weight  of the as declined, these became smaller and smaller until they were phased out, but you do see them into the imperial period.

"Absolutely! Whenever I'm asked for sources here about the Inca, I always start with the History of the Conquest of Peru by William H Prescott. I know it is an incredibly antiquated source, but I prefer to think of it as the great-grandfather of Inca history in English. Prescott was nearly blinded by a crust of bread during a food fight at Harvard, but in the end we got an amazing historian out of the terrible accident. He decided his eyesight was too poor to become a lawyer, so he turned to first literature, and then eventually turned to the history of Spain during the time of Fedinand, Isabella, and Philip II, hiring Spanish translators to help him work through mountains of primary documents never before translated into English. This proved especially valuable for work on the Inca, as there are many overlapping and often conflicting primary documents recorded by Spaniards and Spanish-speaking Peruvians in the decades after Pizarro's conquest. Prescott did a masterful job of collating all these different accounts and walking a middle path between the discrepancies. While his book has absolutely no archaeology in it whatsoever, as a monograph written in English bringing together all the different Spanish primary documents available, I believe it to be without rival even today.

Okay, okay. Enough of Prescott, much though I do love him. I appreciate this subreddit isn't going to let me use just one source here. I cite him because I know everything I just said is backed up in there somewhere, but I can come up with other sources. 

Walking to my bookshelf —thank you, self-isolation! I am finally doing one of these posts from home!— I would definitely recommend Terence N. D'Altroy's The Incas, Daily Life of the Incas by Louis Baudin, and The Incas and their Ancestors: The Archaeology of Peru by Michael E. Moseley. 

I would not recommend them as a scholarly work —I am suspicious of what a fun read they are, and that they contain some details I haven't found elsewhere— but Burr Cartwright Brundage's Lords of Cuzco and Empire of the Inca are also a colourful deep dive into a history most people know nothing about. Again, I wouldn't hold up Brundage in front of a bunch of historians and say, ""This guy gets it!"" But for laypeople interested in Inca history, he paints quite an accessible picture.

">Was tuition to not be subsidized, the costs of tuition would be >10x  higher than the $45,000/yr average it currently is

Do you have a source for this claim? Yes, tuition fees only make up 3-4% of revenue, but that's because they are *doing* a lot more than teaching.

Looking at the figure here: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterubel/2020/06/29/it-should-scare-us-that-tuition-is-a-tiny-amount-of-medical-school-revenue/?sh=4e2431834acb](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterubel/2020/06/29/it-should-scare-us-that-tuition-is-a-tiny-amount-of-medical-school-revenue/?sh=4e2431834acb)

Over 50% of the revenue comes from medical services, and maybe 20% from research. I was unable to find a similar figure for expenditures, but I wouldn't assume that 100% of their expenditures are directly related to training of doctors.

Anyway, it's worth clarifying that their revenues aren't 4% tuition and 96% subsidy - most of the rest appears to be money the schools are *earning* in one way or another. Sure, they aren't 100% self-sufficient, but it seems incorrect to claim that if subsidies disappeared, the tuition would have to go up 10x to make ends meet.

Edit: found a better figure. [https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/interactive-data/i-revenue-us-medical-schools-source-fiscal-year-2018](https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/interactive-data/i-revenue-us-medical-schools-source-fiscal-year-2018)

So ""Government and parent support"", ""gifts and endowments"" are 8% of revenue, tuition is 4%; without these, tuition would go up by about 3x."
"It is not true that ""by the First Crusade however, curved swords largely supplanted straight swords for military use in contemporary eastern cultures.""  The narrow curved sabres seem to have been invented by Turkic-speakers in the Black Sea steppes around the 8th century CE while Arabs and Persians used straight two-edged swords.  For many centuries thereafter, Arabs Syrians and Persians associated curved swords with Turks.  During the First crusade, most sedentary warriors in all the armies used straight two-edged swords.  We can see this by reading Arabic treatises on swords which describe Rus and Frankish sword-blades as similar in shape to Yemeni or Egyptian or Kharwazemi sword-blades.  The classic Persian shamshir was first invented in the 15th century CE.

Around the year 1000, big fighting knives stop appearing in the ground or artwork in Catholic countries, and swords forged in those countries get more cross-shaped. Asymetric weapons start to reappear in France and its neighbours from the 13th century onwards, but they are often showed in the hands of ruffians, rarely preserved in collections, and marked with protective signs to ward off bad influences which don't appear on straight two-edged weapons from the same places.  Meanwhile Turks and Mongols made military progress across Eurasia under people like the Sejluks and Genghis Khan and the Mamelukes and the Timurids and the Mughals.  In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, most of the Moslems and Eurasian Pagans who Catholics and Protestants met were using curved single-edged swords inspired by Turkish and Mongol fashions.  But at the same time, Europeans were losing the taboo against single-edged asymmetrical weapons, until in the 19th century most European military swords are single-edged and curved.  

So in the end, all it is is a stereotype build out of former Christian taboos and accidents of history.  You could just as well argue that in the early middle ages, most of the peoples from Iran to Iberia used straight two-edged swords, and in the last thousand years many of them switched to curved single-edged swords.

"It is a fairly safe assumption, but I don't have anything off hand to speak to those issues.

I'll see if I can't hunt down something that does talk about the issue, but welcome anyone else to weigh in if they have sources on that. The closest he makes mention of is some soldiers encamped on the grounds of Spotsylvania sometime after the battle, who noted that:

"EDIT: Okay -- the FOUR part answer is all done. I might have done a little bit crazy. A couple people messaged me about Foucault -- I wrote a response in Part 4 below  (and about how, despite finding him influential, I largely agree with the mods policy on him).

&#x200B;

What a wonderful question! I'm going to answer this in three parts -- the first talking about autopsies and medical perception, the second about Charles II, and the third to generally talk about my approach to paleopathology and medical history.

&#x200B;

So here is my ""mod alert"" -- I am going to talk about the ever-controversial Michel Foucault (though very early Foucault). Foucault, of course, is always a controversial reference on r/AskHistorians (and in history in general). If you want to rustle some jimmies, try citing ""Discipline and Punish"" in this forum. That being said, it's more or less impossible to talk about pathological anatomy and the Paris Clinical School before referencing a very early Foucault book ""The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception"". As far as I'm aware, this is the first serious study of medical perception and the postmodern concept of ""the gaze"" (Foucault used the French phase ""le regard"", which is usually translated as ""clinical gaze,"" but the term ""medical perception"" used most commonly in his title I think fits bette). Foucault is interested in the dawning of the Paris Clinical School, starting in the waning days of the Ancien Regime and lasting through the Revolution and the next several decades. I'll actually defend Foucault's historiography in this case (of course, the man himself would hate that I used the word history of describe anything he did) -- the work is very well referenced, and mostly concerned with the discourse of physicians themselves. That being said, while he's been very influential, his historiography is overly reliant on these physicians' own interpretations, and modern historiography (Erwin Ackerknecht, and more recently La Berge and Hannaway) has unsurprisingly revealed a far subtler picture. For example, where Foucault sees a sharp break between the classical and hypothetical curriculum of the Ancien Regime faculty and new hands-on ""hospital medicine,"" scholars have actually looked at notes from students studying in both these regimes, and notes a more gradual shift.

&#x200B;

That was quite a caveat -- but I actually take Foucault's philosophy of science quite seriously. So one of Foucault's central theses in Birth of the Clinic (expounded more in The Order of Things) is that medical perception is largely driven by unconscious assumptions about what constitutes disease and man's relationship to it. This is in contrast to the traditional scientific narrative that medical understanding happens gradually as more knowledge is slowly added. He would argue that these collections of unconscious assumptions (he would later label this an ""episteme"") in fact are not additive but replace one another.

&#x200B;

So I want to talk about three different epistemes before I get to Charles II. The first is what I would call traditional Western medicine, dating back to the ancients. Simplifying quite a bit, this is the idea that human health and disease is caused by balances and imbalances in the four constituent body fluids -- blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. These body fluids are directly affected by the natural environment. Food, weather, altitude, close contacts, the alignment of the stars and planets -- all could cause changes in humors, and therefore cause disease. These has some important underlying assumptions. For example, a human organism cannot be separated from its environment. Diseases are not unique entities, but have similar causes. Treatments need to be focused on ""rebalance"". The psychological and the physical are fundamentally interlinked. This is the context in which the tradition of anatomy emerged -- spreading from Vesalius to become an important part of both medical education and Western art. However, there's no sense that DISEASE can be determined from autopsy (or even variants within humans, which is very common).  Disease, after all, lies in the four humors, and the life-bringing pneuma, both of which are obscured by death.

&#x200B;

Starting in roughly the late 17th century, and dominating the 18th, you have the episteme of nosology. Think Sydenham, Cullen, Pinel. They rejected humoral explanations, which didn't line up with the observations they were making. Instead they reclassified human disease based on symptomology and similarity to one another. The big comparison is botany -- just like Linnaeus attempted to classify all life within a hierarchy, doctors did the same, carving out orders, classes, genus, and species (and they carved out a LOT of them). Anatomy by this time was widespread, both in medical education, and after death. The biggest example would be Morgagni, who started to notice that there were different changes after death in oragans associated with different disease states (Auenbrugger is in this tradition too, though he's most often associated with the next episteme).

&#x200B;

Which takes us to the third episteme -- that of pathological anatomy. I could go on forever about this, but essentially doctors started to realize that certain diseases had specific changes associated with tissue types -- and that what had been thought to be multiple diseases, might be just a single disease with multi-system effects. Think Bayle, Laennec (and Auenbrugger, even though he's writing in the 1760s -- an example of how this is more of a framework rather than a hard and fast rule). This episteme has largely survived to the present day, though with considerable modification -- Virchow readjusted to show that the CELL, rather than tissues, was the fundamental unit of disease, and germ theory gave an incredibly important etiologic factor, and the 20th and 21st century has revealed even smaller units, such as CML, caused by the BCR-ABL translocation.

&#x200B;

However, for the most part, our modern noslogy outside of psychiatry (these days the ICD-10) largely operates on these assumptions. And there are important assumptions. For example, close examination of the patient, in ways they cannot access, are now of extreme importance (back then this meant percussion and a stethoscope; now it means MRIs, PET scans, biopsies, &c). These has had important implications in removing patients from their own state of health. Disease is also now freed from the metaphysical (France no longer employs astrologers and meteorologists to track outbreaks, like in the Ancien Regime). It turns out that it's also a fairly effective way to target treatments, hence its dominance."

"Worth mentioning Namibia as an indicator of where Epp would have steered German policy in Africa

 Epp early in his career participated in the Namibia Genocide.

Another notable figure was Eugen Fischer, who conducted medical experiments on Namibian concentration camp victims and who was later responsible for overseeing the sterilisation program of the so called ""Rhineland Bastards"" "
"There's not *nothing -* Hemingway's *For Whom The Bell Tolls* (which has been adapted to the screen at least once, but I'm no film buff sadly) is the most famous novel to come out of Spain (Orwell's *Homage to Catalonia* also deserves a mention, though isn't strictly fiction). Films like Pan's Labyrinth and Land and Freedom are also worthwhile, though aren't centred on the International Brigades. I keep hearing rumours that someone in America is making a TV show about the American volunteers, but haven't heard anything new on that front in a while.

One interesting thing I would note is the surprising recurrence of Spain as backstory in more mainstream media. The most famous is probably Rick of *Casablanca* fame, but is still found today - Archer, for instance, has flying in Spain as a major part of his backstory in whatever season it was that they spent on a Pacific Island c. 1939. In each case, it's shorthand for ruined - but redeemable - idealism, which seems apt to me."

Fantastic answer. I learned things I didn't even know I wanted to learn. 
"It wasn't during the war, the incident happened in 1931 when Churchill was out of government and giving a lecture tour (see [""Not His Finest Hour""] (http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/nyregion/thecity/07fyi.html) from the NY Times). Prohibition was repealed in 1933 so Churchill didn't need to worry about prescriptions on his later travels.

Update: Churchill rapidly capitalised on the episode, writing *My New York Misadventure* (reprinted in [*Finest Hour* #136] (https://www.winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour/finest-hour-136/my-new-york-misadventure)) while in hospital and taking a convalescent trip to the Bahamas on the proceeds. Churchill cabled Frederick Lindemann, later his chief scientific adviser in the war, for a calculation of the forces involved in the collision; Lindemann thought it was ""Equivalent stopping ten pound brick dropped six hundred feet, or two charges buckshot pointblank range"" and ended his reply ""Congratulations on preparing suitable cushion, and skill in taking bump."""
"If this is an area of research interest for you or /u/muskwatch, I have an anecdote with dates that might help you track down a source:

On or around 10 September 2015, I attended a performance at the Ḵay Llnagaay Heritage Centre in Skidegate, on Haida Gwaii, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. I unfortunately cannot find the performer's name, but she was a Maori woman who noted that she had spent significant time living with the indigenous peoples of the North American pacific northwest. Her music blended genres and cultures, but included a significant focus on ""looping"" (playing short repeated recordings overtop of one another to compose music). If I had to guess I'd say she was in her mid-30s at the time, but this was 5 years ago and I don't have many records, so I could be off by 10+ years.

I'm no doubt butchering the story, but the performer explained how the women in her family are keepers of a Maori origin story, in which 8 boats traveled from their ancestral homeland. Unfortunately the boats were separated at sea, and only one landed in Aotearoa, which became their home. The other 7 boats were presumed lost forever. This story, she said, had been passed down in her family for as long as Maori had lived in New Zealand.

She said that on her first visit to BC, she told this story to a group of indigenous elders, who grew very excited. Through translators, they arranged for her to meet a elder woman from another band, who had a story of her own:

The origin story of this indigenous group (one family? A band? Haida? Tlingit? Tsimshian? I don't remember), as kept by this elder and passed down through the generations, again to the best of my recollection, was that 8 canoes had left their ancestral lands in search of a new home. The ships were separated at sea, but managed to regroup--All except for one, which was presumed lost forever.

So the tale of the meeting of the two women, both keepers of stories, each seemingly complimented by the other, was extremely moving. The lost boat had finally been found, after bejng separated by thousands of miles, 1000 years later, etc etc. Not a lot of dry eyes.

It's hard for a white atheist like me to know when a story is sincere, versus when it's a yarn meant as allegory with a greater message, or if liberties were being taken with numbers and roles. But the tale was beautiful and no doubt helps contribute to the anecdotes mentioned above.

So yeah. If any genuine researchers are reading this and looking for clues, I'd suggest reaching out to the Heritage Centre in Skidegate and seeing if you can track down an old programming schedule or recording. (Better than a phonecall though, if you can get funding for it, Haida Gwaii is a stunning place with some of the most welcoming people on the planet, and absolutely worth a trip)."
"Oh, it's a subreddit policy--we don't allow questions about or discussions of events within the past 20 years. Two reasons: first, it takes historians some time to assess the causes, effects, and significance of a phenomenon or event; second, it prevents the devolution of a comment chain into a morass of modern political polemic. There is literally the rest of reddit for that. ;)"
"Not to my knowledge, and it's not a true sentiment in any event. They did not have anything like a real bomb project.

Rumors about the purported German proximity to having nuclear weapons are frequent but are primarily used to justify the US program. They do not reflect their actual state of research, which was nascent, much less their state of industrial production, which was nil. Beware of rumors to this effect!

"As far as poor Abul-Abaz (Abu al-Abbas, Abul-Abbas, &c) who walked from Baghdad to Germany is concerned, there's no Abbasid side of the tale. But we can still talk about lions and cheetahs and polar bears! So, why?

Menageries were a major aspect of what we call ""performing kingship"" (or sultanship, in this case) in the Middle Ages. Possession and display of exotic animals was a marker of highest status all around the world! Even non-kings wanted to get in on the act.

You might think of the polar bear swimming in the 13th century Thames on a long chain. Or the giraffe sent from the Swahili city-states to India and on to China in the 15th century. When Spanish colonizers made it to Tenochtitlan, [they interpreted Moctezuma's collection of exotic animals as a royal menagerie, too](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/58jcd4/were_humans_included_in_moctezumas_zoo/).

The joy and prestige of menageries was just as true for Islamic rulers at least from Umayyad days. But you would not have seen the equivalent of a polar bear swimming in the Tigris, nor been the 17th century Norfolk woman named Mary Jenkinson, who was in the habit of petting the lions in the Tower of London. (That story does not end happily.)

No, in Abbasid Baghdad, exotic animals were reserved for the sultan at his palace. Yaqut al-Rumi in the 12th century says that the menagerie area also included an aviary and a hunting park. Later sources suggest that menageries weren't just open-environment Jurassic Park-type free-for-alls, but included stables, fences, and other structures for animals' and keepers' protection.

Unfortunately for us and Abul Abbaz, Arabic sources tend to say a lot more about animals *incoming* than *outgoing*. For the Abbasid era, they also tend to still be in Arabic which I do not read. So I hope it is okay if I draw from near-contemporary Turkey and from Mamluk rule to give some flavor of what animals might have come to Abbasid Baghdad from Indian, Arabia, Central Asia, and Africa.

In 1258, the Ilkhanate infamously sacked Baghdad. In 1263, the Golden Horde proposed joint anti-Ilkhanate action with the Mamluk rulers. Along with a whole mess of other diplomatic gifts, they reached out to signal their sincerity with:

* elephants
* giraffes
* Arabian stallions
* multiple kinds of donkey
* what Donald Little refers to as ""racing camels"" and boy do I want to know about medieval camel races now
* Arabian racehorses, specifically

Oh, and also various armour and clothing and other accoutrements for the animals, of course.

(Animal clothing was A Thing in the medieval world. Medieval Arab veterinary writers are deeply unhappy with the owners of hunting dogs keeping them warm in clothing of fine brocade instead of in leftover scraps. In the case of gifts, of course, we are thinking something along Indian wedding dress lines...probably not so much for hunting dogs.)

Al-Maqrizi, visiting a royal menagerie in 9th century Turkey (shortly after Charlemagne's day), was very impressed with the animal selection and hence with ruler Khumarawayh:

* songbirds (discussed at some length)
* elephants
* tigers
* cheetahs
* giraffes
* horses
* camels
* donkeys

and--as we might imagine poor Mary Jenkinson had once believed--a pair of lions who were especially beloved by and tame for the sultan.

So we have no words from an Abbasid zookeeper weeping at the loss of their elephant to the Frankish barbarians (as contemporary Arabic sources would have it), or of their family devasted by losing a member to the expedition north. 

But we can paint a lavish picture of the animal world of early medieval rulers, and of sultans taking the time out of a stressful day to pet their lions."
"Thanks for this link to Beloved Comrade u/commiespaceinvader’s awesome earlier response. A follow up:

By 1913, Sigmund Freud was 57 years old and in the process of becoming famous. Would the young struggling artist / anti-Semite or the young communists have known about the groundbreaking Jewish theorist and his ideas?

They did later, of course, with the Nazis burning Freud’s works in ‘33 and the Soviets first embracing, then suppressing, but I’m basically wondering just how famous was Freud in 1913 and would the others have already had opinions about him and his ideas."
"Sure! How do we determine what is a continent? Most people would say, a big independent land mass. That's a thing of nature. Okay. But who determines:

* How big does a ""land mass"" have to be to count as a continent instead of an island?
* Is the giant thing in the Western Hemisphere one continent (all attached!), two continents (as in our current scheme), or three continents (what about Central America? we don't call the continent ""North and Central America,"" after all)?
* Why are Europe and Asia two continents? If the Urals are taken to be important enough to be a divider, why aren't the frakking *Himalayas*?
* What is up with the term ""subcontinent"" just for India? 

None of those are questions with ""natural"" answers. They're all determined by humans. In our current global intellectual culture, they have a generally agreed-upon (if debated) answer. Thus--culturally constructed. 

I hope this helps!"
"That is a fascinating topic to discuss that of course could never be answered definitively. It also can be a tough topic to discuss due to the politicization of the topic that has existed since at least Appomattox Courthouse. If I had to sum up my opinion on this in a tldr it would be: Probably not, but stranger things have happened.

One of the more illuminating books I've read on this topic is, *A Savage War*, by Hsieh and Murray. A fairly recent single volume history of the Civil War that in part wrestles with that question. If I had to sum up their view, it would be that while the South was a large underdog by almost any metric, the task before the North, politically, militarily, economically, and culturally, was enormous and its result was not a foregone conclusion.

As for the North's advantages: It's economy was several times larger than the South's, as was its population. Not only was its economy much larger, it was more diverse. With well known advantages in technology and manufacturing, but also the Midwest was starting to boom as a producer of agricultural goods which helped to make up for the loss of the South's agricultural production during the war. The South's economy of course was very much dependent on cotton exports, which were not possible due to the Union blockade, and was much less built up in manufacturing in an era that arguably was the dawn of industrialized warfare.

This gets to another advantage of the Union which doesn't get enough attention, its *overwhelming* naval might. The South fought for most of the war under a blockade that stretched from the coast of Virginia to Texas, and from New Orleans to eventually the length of the entire Mississippi. The South had zero ability to materially impact the Union navy and the result was devastating on their chances. The North's naval control of the seas and the waterways gave it a huge logistical advantage over the South.

And yet while the North had enormous advantages over the South, they also had a much harder job. The South essentially needed to maintain the status quo after secession, the North needed to conquer an enormous and in many areas wild country full of people who were dedicated to fighting them. Murray and Hsieh make the interesting point that the distance from New Orleans to Richmond was roughly the same distance from Berlin to Moscow. The area the North had to conquer, hold, and pacify was of continental proportions and was a massive task for an army that just a few years before was not much more than a glorified garrison force.

Murray and Hsieh then stumble into the great man debate of history, in giving Lincoln and Grant enormous credit for the North winning the Civil War. Personally I think they make a good case. I think if the North's president had been a mediocrity, or there was no General Grant, that it's possible that the South could have held out for a peace deal and recognition of its independence. That being said, that's the only way I could see it happening. More through Union incompetence than by anything the South could have done differently.

Edit: Wow, thanks for the awards!"
"So, as a qualifier, this is related to the academic work that I do (social movement theory) but I don’t have specific knowledge about the actual production of signs in the 30s-50s, I’m not a historian, and my focus isn’t on street protests.


That aside, I did some research and do have a few things that are generally related. 


Generally, I think that your question concerns the creation of protest art - there’s a long history of socially conscious artists collaborating with social movements. Admittedly, a lot of the focus is on more ‘traditional’ artwork, i.e., the Guerilla Girls posters (group esp. active in the 80s to this day, created posters and art critiquing lack of diversity in NYC art world), or Picasso’s Guernica (‘37, raised awareness re Spanish Civil War), the iconography of the Black Panther Party, and so on. 


I’m not aware of much of a body of work on the actual creation of the specific protest signs themselves, but I have seen references to it in general histories (although most of the examples I have are from AIDS activism/ACT UP in the late 20th century, so I’m not sure where to look for the time period you’re concerned with). However, the long-standing connection between the arts world and social movements does suggest that there’s an unusual amount of artistic talent in protest movements, so it does sort of follow that even relatively quotidian protest signs would be excellently lettered as well. Basically, 'good guy graphic designers' is probably not too far off the mark; they were probably part of the movement as well. 


For the last image, however, I have a better answer as to why they’re so well done: they actually are professional artists. 

Unless I’m completely wrong, that’s from the Disney Strike of 1941. These were strikes over the summer of ‘41 over unionization at Disney (primary source for this is Lisa Johnson’s The Disney Strike of 1941: From the Animator’s Perspective, an excellent brief history of/take on the strike). 


At the time, the animators were trying to unionize. The strikes were ‘officially’ set off after “seventeen artists were escorted out of Walt Disney Studios” for trying to unionize. Really, they had been brewing for some time. Disney had just finished Snow White in ‘37. The studio had to massively ramp up production to do so, and shifted to a much more professional/structured system of animation from their old model of ‘a handful of animators working … with … Walt”. Getting the film finished had required an enormous amount of work/sacrifice on the part of the animators, and they didn’t feel that they had been properly compensated. Then, shortly thereafter, World War 2 had broken out, causing general tumult but also tanking the European markets for Pinocchio, Disney’s next film. The company had just massively expanded, and was under immense financial pressure.


The animators wanted recognition: screen credits and IP rights, as well as more creative control over their work. Walt Disney, in turn, tried to regain control over the projects that were growing larger and larger, and attempted to keep control. Part of this entailed suppressing labor organizing on the part of the animators. He created the Disney Federation of Screen Cartoonists, a company union that effectively existed to try and channel/prevent other union organizing that would be more disruptive.


One of the studio’s head animators, Art Babbitt, was initially chosen to lead the company union. However, he found that it was pretty much impossible to get any concessions from Disney (i.e., a 2 dollar raise for the animators) and decided to join up with the pre-existing Screen Cartoonists Guild instead. They gathered an enormous number of their fellow animators (400/560 eligible became card-carrying member) and went to Disney to negotiate. On May 28th, Babbitt and some of his fellow leaders sat down with Disney.


They were promptly fired for ‘union activities’ (they were the seventeen artists mentioned above). Firing workers for unionizing was strictly illegal, as per the Wagner Act/Supreme Court litigation of the mid-late 30’s, yet Disney made it abundantly clear that was why they were fired.


So, their demands not met, the Disney workers went on strike. They fired back and forth competing demands with Disney without making much headway (incidentally, the first representative Disney put in charge was Willie Bioff, a figure in organized crime who was indicted on federal charges of extortion midway through the negotiation, and was a well-known union buster). On July 5th, the US Gov’t sent a negotiator to try and mediate, and did get some of the striking unions to return to work, but had trouble actually making peace.


At this point, the strikers attracted national attention from various newspapers and op-eds, were accused of sympathizing with Communists and being un-American. Eventually, by the end of July, the strike did sort of fizzle to an end: the AFL unions they had been striking with went back to work, there were a few raises and re-hirings, and things eventually returned to normal. They didn’t end up being able to make significant structural change in the company, and many of the strikers were later surreptitiously fired again once things blew over.


However, because they were a massive group of animators/cartoonists, with a lot of time on their hands, they did make some lovely signs!

"The short answer is yes, but on an individual level moreso than a societal one.

Prior to the 1970s, most historical inquiry into the 1918 pandemic was medical and epidemiological in nature - focused on diagnosing the causes and failures of public health in order to prevent a reoccurrence. Crosby's *Epidemic and Peace, 1918* was among the first works to explore the pandemic's social consequences. Quoting a review since I don't have access to the original text: 

""Despite these grim statistics...the flu epidemic prompted no panic or awe at the time, stimulated much less public attention or official action than one might have expected, and left remarkably little imprint on the public memory and historical consciousness. It appears that the primary national concern with the war itself absorbed the epidemic ""as simply a subdivision of the war."" The disease struck and moved through any given area rapidly, and although illness was widespread, the low fatality rate (2-3 percent) was not sufficient to excite great fear. Those who died went quickly; the overwhelming majority recovered without lasting or visible injury.""

However, here we might make a distinction between the social-historical pronouncement of ""the worst year ever"" and the individual-familial judgement of ""the worst year ever *for me*."" The reviewer continues:

""...making a distinction between ""the level of collectivities"" and ""the *atoms* of human societies,"" Crosby concluded that the experience did indeed have a significant and enduring influence on individuals as evidenced in personal memoirs and letters of ordinary people.""

Crosby argued that for the millions of people who had lost loved ones, the pandemic was a watershed moment in their lives. In the United States, the pandemic caused more death and suffering than all of the twentieth-century wars combined, but without any of the broader-scale social reckoning. It was, in essence, an individual tragedy experienced millions of times over.

Elizabeth ascension to the throne came about at the end of WW2 in the early days of the post war era.

""The coronation was like a phoenix-time,"" recalled Princess Margaret of the postwar moment. ""Everything was being raised from the ashes … and nothing to stop anything getting better and better."" The trope of the times was clear: the young Queen offered Britain (but, first and foremost, England) another go at Gloriana. ""It is our hope that Her Majesty may live long and happily and that her reign may be as glorious as that of her great predecessor, Queen Elizabeth I,"" announced Clement Attlee on behalf of the Labour party. ""Let us hope we are witnessing the beginning of a new Elizabethan age no less renowned than the first.""

By happy coincidence, and some deft media management, news of Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay's ascent of Mount Everest was announced on the day of the coronation service. ""Be Proud of Britain on This Day,"" ran the Daily Express headline.

Its also important to note that they chose to retain the surname Windsor.

With Elizabeth's accession, it seemed probable that the royal house would bear her husband's name, becoming the House of Mountbatten, in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary, favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, and so on 9 April 1952 Elizabeth issued a declaration that Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, ""I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II#Reign_.281952.E2.80.93present.29


Its also probably worth noting that at this point the British still had their Empire, Decolonisation was only just starting to happen and Britain was still a significant global power so people were optimistic about the future regardless of where you fell on the issue of Decolonisation.
 

--------------------------------------------
I couldn't really find anything at all that suggested their were significant worries about her ascension to the throne, though I have to admit I was relying on internet sources and finding anything of any kind of significance was difficult, like I was able to find out that they chose to retain the Windsor name but not why they did it.

Maybe someone better read on royal history will be able to help but from what I could tell there was no real criticism or worries at the time of the coronation.

"Concretely the KPD (German Communist Party) received 4.8 million votes (12.3 %) in the last federal election before Hitler's ascendancy. 

There were a lot of limitations that meant the communists weren't able to properly cohere left-wing resistance throughout the late 20s and early 30s though. The most important of which was the comintern's policy during the ""third period"", which saw the KPD arguing that there was fundamentally no difference between the Social Democrats and the Nazis, and that Hitler's government would be just as unstable as the conservative governments that had preceded it, and that once it inevitably fell it would be the communists turn to take power. 

Obviously they were wrong on all accounts, and this ultraleft sectarianism meant that they weren't able to provide any kind of effective leadership against fascism.

"The native Africans of Liberia and Sierra Leone have arguably had to deal with the brunt of the consequences of this movement. Liberia was established as an American colony to send back ex-slaves from the United States, while Sierra Leone was established for the same reason as a British colony. I can speak to Liberia and hopefully someone else can chime in about Sierra Leone. 

The descendants of ex-slaves in Liberia are generally referred to as Americo-Liberians by Westerners and Congo or Congau by West Africans. 

In the first half of the 19th century, the American Colonization Society (the organization primarily responsible for the ‘Back to Africa’ movement) sent at least 4,500 ex-slaves to Liberia. It is estimated that only about 1,800 survived. Among these was a man named Joseph Jenkins Roberts, who encouraged a movement for Liberian independence and became president of the country when that independence was achieved in 1847. Although independent, Liberia continued to receive a large amount of support and protection from the US government. 

From 1847 until 1980, the government of Liberia was controlled by Americo-Liberians. To some, this leadership was good. William Tubman, considered the father of modern Liberia and its longest-serving President, served during a period of overwhelming economic growth. He improved the country’s infrastructure and successfully lobbied foreign businesses and politicians to invest in the country. 

Their leadership did not sit well with most indigenous inhabitants of the region. Americo-Liberians made up a very small amount of the population (around 5%), and many of their policies encouraged what was seen by many as the exploitation of indigenous tribes, particularly on rubber plantations. They also didn’t have the right to vote. Americo-Liberians refused to marry with native Liberians, viewing them as ‘racially inferior.’ The economic support granted to Liberia did not extend to them, but only to Americo-Liberians. Because of this, they were much wealthier than the natives, leading to widespread animosity. It is difficult to avoid noting the irony of these policies being promoted by people who themselves had recently been victims of similar policies. Similar to White Americans, many Americo-Liberians argues that the native populations were not beyond redemption—they could become civilized through conversion to Christianity and adoption of Western values. 

Presidents since at least the early 20th century had been trying to deal with the increasing divide between Native  populations and Americo-Liberians. President Arthur Barclay asked for better relations between the two groups, but very little was actually done to achieve this. Tubman attempted to bridge this gap during his presidency through a policy known as ‘National Unification.’ It is celebrated today on May 14th in Liberia as ‘National Unification’ or ‘Integration Day.’ Tubman extended the right to vote to native populations as well as women. Society became more integrated as native Liberians began to move to Monrovia in search of work and work alongside Americo-Liberians (previously the populations had been mostly separate). This integration also brought increased hostility as the economic disparities between the two groups were put on full display. 

Tubman is a controversial figure. After an attempted assassination in 1955, he became increasingly authoritarian. Although the policy of National Unification may have seemed to be working during his presidency, after his death in 1971, things began breaking down. William Tolbert succeeded Tubman. 

Tolbert was in many ways caught between a rock and a hard place. A member of one of the wealthiest Americo-Liberian families in the nation, his ascension did little to appease the still-frustrated native populations, since it highlighted even further the economic disparities between the two groups. Tolbert tried to appease them and further the policy of National Unification by speaking Kpelle, an indigenous language, and bringing in more indigenous people into the government. This in turn, led to extreme anger from the Americo-Liberian population. Tolbert’s own cabinet hated the idea. Tolbert attempted to make the country more democratic and less reliant on the West, a policy which was popular with some indigenous groups, but not with the Americo-Liberians who feared their hold on power would be lost. All this came to a head in 1980, when Tolbert was assassinated in a coup by Samuel Doe, effectively ending nearly 140 years of Americo-Liberian rule. 

I don’t really want to go into the Liberian civil war because it would be too lengthy and go too far from the question but suffice it to say to this day there still remains a divide between the population of the descendants of ex-slaves in Liberia and indigenous populations.

The short answer to your question is—the vast majority of West Africans did not like this movement since it forced a repressive system of government upon them run by people who were seen by West Africans as foreign colonizers."
"This question is a bit hard to answer, but I can give you some insight from a legal perspective. 

Criminal prosecutions of organizations (for example, a business firm, or in this instance a ""church"") are guided by the U.S. Attorneys' manual, which is promulgated by the Office of the U.S. Attorney. The relevant materials can be found [here.](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-28000-principles-federal-prosecution-business-organizations)

Here are some guidelines from the manual:

> Prosecutors should focus on wrongdoing by individuals from the very beginning of any investigation of corporate misconduct.  By focusing on building cases against individual wrongdoers, we accomplish multiple goals. First, we increase our ability to identify the full extent of corporate misconduct.  **Because a corporation only acts through individuals, investigating the conduct of individuals is the most efficient and effective way to determine the facts and the extent of any corporate misconduct.**  Second, a focus on individuals increases the likelihood that those with knowledge of the corporate misconduct will be identified and provide information about the individuals involved, at any level of an organization.  Third, we maximize the likelihood that the final resolution will include charges against culpable individuals and not just the corporation.

More specific information about prosecuting individuals can be found [here.](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-28000-principles-federal-prosecution-business-organizations#9-28.210)

Another relevant bit:

> Prosecutors should be aware of the public benefits that can flow from indicting a corporation in appropriate cases. For instance, **corporations are likely to take immediate remedial steps when one is indicted for criminal misconduct** that is pervasive throughout a particular industry, and thus an indictment can provide a unique opportunity for deterrence on a broad scale. In addition, a corporate indictment may result in specific deterrence by changing the culture of the indicted corporation and the behavior of its employees.

There are practical difficulties to go along with these states goals. Specifically, many criminal charges require a level of intent, or *mens rea*, which really doesn't apply to an organization, because it's a legal fiction that must operate through individuals. While this doesn't necessarily prevent the criminal prosecution of an organization, it does make it more difficult if other members of the organization claim that the individual bad-actors were not acting on behalf of the organization, but were rather rogue agents. And this is, of course, what the Church of Scientology claimed:
"
"I'd hold of to see if a real expert comes along to correct me but from what i've read that would depend on the period. 

Early Manipal legions were very much self equipped. The soldiers paid for it all out of pocket and purchased it all themselves. So I think its fair to assume that there'd be some variation, particularly with things like maybe helmet crests and other decorative pieces and exactly how much armour someone like a Hastatus would wear. Particularly as the campaign went on seeing as the equipment for many troops in the hastarii and the like wasn't particularly exceptional it seems reasonable that at least some of these troops would be looking for suitable looted equipment to up armour themselves. 

As you go into the Marian legions they formalised the progression of the Roman army into being increasingly professional soldiers. As such the state purchased the equipment instead of the individual soldier. But also a trait of much of the republican period is you tend to see it be more often that legions are raised as necessary and may well not be replenished much during the course of their service until they either became too small to use practically or all the men came to the end of their service and the legion was retired and replaced. That comes a notable factor in things like the civil war where you had a dynamic where new legions would generally be larger but far less experienced that standing legions. Nether the less wear and tear is a thing and soldiers like to steal.

Then you go into the imperial period and legions become more like modern regiments where you'd normally get a cycle of men dying or retiring and being replaced in the same legion as a steady replacement. That seems likely to introduce some variation, particularly if the legion has been redeployed a long way. 

By the late empire the army set up large manufacturing areas that produced large amounts of a particular type of weapon and armour. While that would seem like it might introduce increased uniformity i've also heard a lot of variation in exactly what a late legionary might be carrying to so i'm not sure how much you'd see there."

"The mob tended to prey upon (and still tends to prey upon) poor and immigrant communities; i.e. people who were vulnerable and disconnected from civil society.

Hoover was famously something of a megalomaniac. The idea that an underworld existed outside of his control or understanding was anathema, because it meant that his all powerful and all knowing FBI was not what it was hyped up to be. This brings us into really dangerous waters concerning his ego, which isn't really something I feel comfortable speculating about."
"Yes, I know some of them. Let me explain in the specific context of an organization/institution I've had some interactions with: The Richard Nixon Presidential Library.

The Richard Nixon Library was built in Yorba Linda, CA and opened in 1990. The federal government of the United States normally operates Presidential Libraries. They provide federal funding, send materials for safe-keeping to the libraries from the National Archives, and generally involve themselves in the administration and upkeep of the Library. When it came time to build the Nixon Library, the federal government opted not to involve itself. They refused to sanction it. So, instead, the Nixon family set about building their own library and in order to do so they raised 25 million dollars completely from private sources for its construction. That would indicate that there were plenty of Nixonians out there still eager to support the President. But there's more going on. In order to staff the Library, which was operating on a pretty tight budget given its lack of federal funding, the administration essentially incorporated an extensive system of volunteer docents, usually (but not exclusively) upper/middle class white elderly individuals, almost all of whom were universally Nixon supporters. In 2004-2005, the federal government finally authorized the absorption of the private Richard Nixon Library into the federally-funded and directed Presidential Library system. This, in turn, caused some significant consternation among both volunteers and other supporters of Nixon for fear that the National Archives would, in their administration, change the Library to a fundamentally negative portrayal of Nixon when it had been giving a relatively positive description of Nixon up until that point. Similarly, the National Archives were concerned that the Nixonian loyalists would essentially put up a constant struggle for control of the workings of the Library in order to maintain a distorted, intentionally rosy view of Nixon. Historian David Greenberg was quoted as saying, ""“With Nixon, there is such a history of distorting history that one has to be suspicious of whether the Nixon family or loyalists will continue... Even though we trust (the) archivist to do things honest and fairly, there are ways.” One real sticking point was the private Nixon Library folks wanting to cancel an annual conference on the Vietnam War when it became apparent that the anti-Nixon attendees would outnumber the pro-Nixon attendees. The National Archives basically had to step in and say, you can't do that, reschedule the conference. Things like that essentially have gone on for quite some time since, until relatively recently when the Library got a major overhaul and a lot of the loyalists were essentially either no longer involved or had passed away, now it's a relatively fair and balanced portrayal of Nixon's presidency.

Long story short, there were plenty of Nixon supporters who were actively involved as both volunteers, donors, and administrators at the Nixon Library both in its private and federally funded incarnations. My high school girlfriend's grandmother was actually a relatively high-level volunteer/coordinator for the docent program and was herself a Nixon supporter and thus knew a large number of Nixon supporters who I had occasion to meet at a number of social events. They tended to stray away from talking about Watergate (keep in mind I was in high school at the time, so I wasn't really able to engage them in the kind of conversations I would be able to as an adult now) and focused on the most positive aspects of Nixon's presidency. When pushed, I heard a number of them express the idea that Watergate was overblown or a political hit-job, despite Nixon's wrongdoing. I had similar experiences interacting with many of the docents at the museum (to this day, I was there not long ago and there's still plenty of elderly pro-Nixon docents hanging around). They are out there and they are very supportive/protective of a man they believe to be a good President brought down by his enemies rather than his own flaws.

Edit: I should clarify that the ""despite Nixon's wrongdoing"" is my own interjection, because, objectively, Nixon did bad things, there was a reason Ford had to pardon him. The people that I knew who were Nixonians almost entirely believed he didn't do anything wrong or, in a push, anything another President wouldn't have done in his position. Rather, they felt he was unjustly brought down by his political enemies and devious detractors. The original Watergate exhibit at the Richard Nixon Library tended to significantly trend that way."
"Unfortunately we don’t have full details on Martin Luther King Jr’s income. But due to some court cases, most notably a 1960 case on tax fraud, we’ve still got a *decent* idea of his income. He was acquitted on the fraud charges by an entirely white Alabama jury. 

His primary source of income was his salary for being a minister at Ebenezer Baptist Church. This varies by year but appears to have generally been about $6,000 per year, a fairly typical middle class income. According to the Census Bureau, mean income in 1960 was $5,600. By 1968 this had grown to around $8,000. But that’s still in line with the 1970 mean income of $9,870. So he was making a decent but not extravagant living as a minister. 

His salary for his position in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was set at $1 per year. Aside from his salaries he also received reimbursement for a lot of his civil rights work. So while he didn’t receive money for his travel, it also didn’t cost him anything. In addition to his minister’s salary, he also in theory got income for his 5 books he wrote and for prizes he received. But the money for the books, and things like his $54,000 Nobel Peace Prize cash award, was donated to groups like the SCLC. So in practice he limited himself to the income from his ministry position. This was largely what the 1960 fraud indictment centered on. But his personal journals proved to the jury’s satisfaction that he was indeed passing on his secondary incomes to charitable organizations.

His net worth at death was under $6,000 and his family had to rely on charity to get through the early years after his death. Although they’ve since made a lot more through the sale of memorabilia and the like.

I’ll leave Malcolm X to someone else, as I’m not terribly familiar with the details of his income."

"I'm not familiar with Stone's theory, but I can imagine where it comes from. The problem we run into when we try to reconstruct what people thought at the time is that very few voices survive, and we often can't trust those voices when they say something like ""everyone is saying X"" or ""the common people believe X"". In particular, while we have several authors from the Classical period who praise the Spartan education, they are all students of Sokrates (namely Kritias, Plato, and Xenophon). It is possible to argue (as Stone has apparently done) that their view derives from their teacher and no one outside their circle shared it. This is reinforced by the apparently dismissive comments about Sparta's harsh system in Perikles' funeral oration as written by Thucydides.

That said, we do have some signs of a wider appreciation of Spartan ways. Most tellingly, we know that there was a fashion of ""lakonism"" among wealthy Athenian youths, who affected Spartan dress and long hair as a form of elite counter-culture in their democratic surroundings. Aristophanes also sends up some of Sparta's educational practices (like forcing girls to exercise in public), which suggests these things were widely known; his more traditionally-minded character in the *Clouds* actually praises an education system very much like the Spartan one, notably presenting it as the old Athenian way. We should probably assume that there was considerable debate over what was the best way to raise young citizens, and that there was a distinct pro-Spartan camp in such debates.

It is certainly not true that Sokrates was condemned to death for praising Sparta. Though the charges against him vary, *lakonophilia* (love of Sparta) is not among them, and indeed it is never registered as a crime. It could always be argued that his views on Sparta were considered suspect during the Peloponnesian War, but his trial and execution happened in 399 BC, five years after Athens had finally been forced to submit to Sparta; the two states were allied at the time and Athenians would have little reason to revisit the issue and possibly antagonise their hegemon."
"Melcher identifies four contributing factors:

* Quicker growth in other parts of the country have diminished Ohio's relative importance in the electoral college. While it is still one of the larger states, through the 1920s, it was one of only four states with 20+ electoral votes, but by the 1950s it was surpassed by California. During the same era, the Western states as a whole (and most particularly TX) increased their importance, meaning Ohio was no longer as much the happy medium between between an all-important Northeast and South(east) as it once was.

* The changes in the nomination process (moving from being determined by delegates at conventions to voters at primaries) have meant fewer contested nominations at the convention (and none seriously in the Republican Party since after WWII), which has diminished the need for compromise, consensus candidates that Ohio was good at producing. And without being able to win a nomination, an Ohioan hasn't been able to win a general election.

* The changes in the nomination process have also diminished the importance of ""amiableness and connections to party leaders"" in favor of fundraising ability as important to securing the nomination. This has worked to Ohio's disadvantage. 

* Ohio has also lacked any winning Vice-Presidents in the time period, an office that has become more important to hold in an era that has emphasized fund-raising ability.

I would also add that Melcher's identification of Ohio's supply of war veterans from the Civil War ran out. Only one president from Ohio, Harding, ever won after that. World War I produced relatively few war vet candidates (only Truman and Eisenhower won, and only Wilkie lost, and of the three, Truman is the only one who saw combat). And World War II could produce veterans from across the country, unlike the Civil War which gave Ohio an outsized importance (former Confederates were effectively shut out and much of the West was too sparsely populated to be a factor in producing notable war vets).

As /u/EUPW summarized, Shelley and Archer point to the breakdown of sectionalism. Through the 1920s, Democrats could only win by sweeping the ""Solid South"" while most of the Northeast was solidly Republican, and the West was still too electorally insignificant to decide an election (and mostly leaned Republican anyway). The Midwest was the battleground, with Ohio (and Illinois) being its biggest prizes, so that was where the Democrats *needed* to compete to win, so if the Republicans nominated a strong Ohioan, it made it that much more difficult for the Democrats to achieve that goal.

In 1928, Hoover broke through the ""Solid South"", the first Republican to do so since Reconstruction. And then four years later, in 1932, FDR captured most of the Northeast, increasing his hold ~~their~~ there in his 1936 re-election. This resulted in Ohio becoming less of a must-win battleground as the parties found other paths to victory in other parts of the country.

Backing up one of Melcher's points, John R. Wright states that Ohio has remained *one of* the most pivotal swing states after the 1920s, however, he only identifies four further elections through to the end of the 20th century where Ohio proved to be the first or second-most pivotal state (""tipping point"" state if you will), and three of them were landslides anyway (1936, 1964, and 1972). 

Yet, regardless of all this, as Melcher notes, Ohio *has* produced many candidates who have *pursued* the nomination since the 1920s. For the Republicans through 2000, Ohio had hopeful nominees in 1932, 1940, 1944, 1948, 1952, 1968, 1972, and 2000. For the Democrats, they had candidates in 1956, 1968, and 1984. This did translate to one candidate being nominated for Vice-President (John Bricker, on the 1944 losing ticket). Robert Taft was the clear frontrunner in 1952 for the Republicans, if not for party leader Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.'s successful draft campaign to get Eisenhower to run. (Lodge felt Taft's adherence to party orthodoxy of isolationism was too risky at a time when the U.S. as a whole was anything but isolationist, whereas Eisenhower's military record better fit the internationalism of the era.) 

On the Democratic side, Melcher identifies John Glenn in 1984 as precisely the type of candidate that *could* or even would have won when party connections and compromise candidates were more important. But Glenn was running in an era when fund-raising was more important, which favored Mondale who had just been the VP candidate for the party four years earlier and had a network of fundraisers to tap into. And Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson's charisma mattered more in the primary race than the ""bland"" and ""nonideological"" characteristics that nominating conventions of yesteryear tended to prefer.

"The Swedish perspective might be of special interest here. 

I have read quite a lot of private and public sources from 1918-19 Italy and I was genuinely surprised to find the pandemic and the moral and material consequences of it almost entirely absent (and that even after the end of censorship and even in private recollections - being ""bedridden with the flu"" for a few days is a somewhat common off-hand remark in diaries and correspondence, but little more than that). Public and private discussion not only of its death toll (data was available soon enough, as excesses deaths were computed by the Office of the Statistician, albeit with a certain delay - see Mortara, G. - *La salute pubblica in Italia durante e dopo la guerra*, 1925) but of its significance for Italy's society, moral and political cohesion (the themes so prominent in our modern debate), are limited to the very minimum; and occur at best in the recollections and private correspondence of possibly marginalized groups who had been more directly afflicted by the disease (see Tognotti, E. - *La Spagnola in Italia*, 2002). 

I remember the same issue coming up with German sources, which led me to wonder whether it was the paramount importance of war related ""death discourse"" - the ""redemption-sacrifice"" of the fallen soldier, a supremely meaningful death (extended somewhat conveniently to the mobilized worker) - to essentially erase the space for any open examination of alternative and ""weaker"" and ""inconsequential"" forms of death. 

Sweden being a neutral country, such a phenomenon would probably not occur or show up more to a more limited degree. Are you aware of any works on the relation between ""death at war"" discourse and the ""other deaths"" in Sweden? 

To add a little detail, the sources which discuss the disease - those mentioned by Tognotti - do not provide any evidence of a composed resignation: indeed they paint often a picture of violent despair and anger over moral and material conditions of utter misery. But they are *marginal*, and essentially removed from any public discourse."
"Diseases wrecked a terrible toll on the Roman population. We have no hard numbers, of course, but most experts think that Rome was a ""population sink"" - i.e., could only maintain its population through constant immigration, since the native inhabitants were dying faster than they could reproduce.

"I have not seen *The Breakfast Club* to fully understand the context of the scene. Moreover most of my studies regarding food history lie in East Asia, but I can offer some comments on sushi in America. Sushi in the 1980's would still be considered a meal for an occasion, perhaps not as common a meal for the American culinary vocab as it is nowadays, sitting alongside staples such as pizza or tacos with its accessibility through restaurant takeouts or supermarket trays. Certainly, having a decently priced item such as sushi for high school lunch would draw the comments of fellow students.

Japanese food only began to become part of the public American conscious around the 1960's. Following the postwar economic boom years and America's involvement with rebuilding efforts, Japanese culture on a whole began to make waves in America. The worldwide civil unrest of the 60's allowed for American attitudes to broaden and diversify, by the 70's cosmopolitan and consumerist culture meant many educated and upper class families could afford to pursue more adventurous foods. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 allowed for, as its name suggest, more immigration and thus an increase in diversity. This then allowed for ethnic restaurants to open up, sometimes catering to ethnic communities but also for the local populace as well. While there wasn't as big of an immigration of Japanese as other groups during this time, the broadening of palates made the way for sushi to make its mark.

From the 1970's to the 1980's, areas of sushi consumption such as Los Angeles and New York saw the number of Japanese restaurants increase by as much as a factor of ten. Nationwide, in the 1990's to 2000's, this number increased 400 percent.

Raw fish was not the norm of the America diet, and appropriately was considered strange and exotic. However, increasing attention to health and diet as well the connotation of higher class food allowed sushi to draw a certain appeal. This paired with other avenues of cultural imports, period films from renowned artists like Kurosawa and the popular *Shogun* miniseries marked keen interest towards Japan. Within America's informal empire, Japan was a close partner. Cooperation and economic growth made the former wartime adversary into a respected global power.

Japanese aesthetics too were see as high class, refined, and cleanly designed, which only added to the sense of upscale participation in foreign cultures. Food writers and critiques could draw upon cliched imagery of the imagined premodern Japan to paint the exotic and foreign factors of sushi’s ingredients, preparation, and presentation. For example, Phyllis Richman wrote,

>“sushi are highly developed examples of the art of simplicity, of such beauty that it can be appreciated even in the abstract.""

and

>“You feel neither stuffed nor hungry. And definitely
serene.”

Reviewers of Washington's premier *Samurai Sushiko* restaurant saw comments like:

>“an occasion of purity and subtlety, of contrasting sharpness and
intensity, almost a ceremony”

and

>“like eating in the middle of a Japanese brush
painting” or “a small museum of Japanese arts.”

Another Post writer likened sushi as:

>“an edible ikebana. A haiku in seaweed and translucent flesh.”

Karen Kenyon wrote on the San Diego restaurant *Samurai*:

>“Walking into Samurai is like walking into a Zen poem... the feeling of harmony [that] exists in the balance of the Samurai warrior figure and the Japanese Geisha doll who stand and wait on opposite sides of the entry.”

Philadelphia food writer Elaine Tait described her meal at a Japanese restaurant as:

>“serenely beautiful as a placid, lily-covered pond.”

All this romanticized imagery of the sushi experience tantilized the middle and upper class Americans. Etiquette to had to be followed as much as one might do in a proper French or Italian restaurant. Manuals described the proper ways of eating sushi. Jeffrey Carmel of the Christian Science Monitor in 1983 wrote:

>“Before venturing into a sushi restaurant, it is a good idea to learn some sushi etiquette to avoid embarrassing yourself with soy-sauce-soaked rice balls disintegrating in your fingers and fish falling all over the place.”

Post critic Melissa Davis wrote of her experience""

>“The Japanese think it is very funny if you try to bite sushi in half. It is rather like watching someone attack a Big Mac with a knife and fork. Not exactly gauche or rude, but amusingly ignorant. The first time I had sushi, the owner of the restaurant rushed frantically towards me and in sign language showed me how I was doing it all wrong.”

Diners could avoid such scenarios and show off their cultural capital and knowledge by ""properly"" eating sushi, dipping the sushi in a shallow dish of soy sauce, fish side down, and placing the whole morsel in their mouths.

Japanese food that was known to Americans prior to the explosion of sushi would have been cooked foods, such as teriyaki, tempura, sukiyaki, and the like. By understanding Japanese cuisine as grilled, broiled, boiled, or fried beef, chicken, and seafood, Japanese food was more relatable for the average American. Cookbooks thus omitted mentions of raw fish or sushi. Sushi then stood out and became prominent because it was so unlike any other food. It was raw, colorful, and embodied some premium aesthetic not found in most foods.

Eating sushi became a way to distinguish oneself, to let others see and know your education, economic standing, and openness to new ideas and cultures. In other words, you might be considered a sophisticated individual for daring to eat raw fish, at least, that's what many would have wanted to have been thought as. Poking fun at the consumerist class, *The Yuppie Handbook* listed sashimi among its “Things Yuppies Eat for Lunch.” Food Historian Lisa Heldke said:

>“By sampling a cuisine none of your friends has tasted, you accumulate a bit of sophistication that you can bank, and invest later in a social situation in which it is important to raise your stature.”

To return to *The Breakfast Club*, Andrew C. McKevitt writes:

>Like the other Japanese goods in this book, by the 1980s sushi not only had established a noticeable material presence across the United States but also had entered the American popular imagination. John Hughes’s iconic 1980s teen drama *The Breakfast Club* used sushi to highlight class distinctions among its detention-bound students. The snobbish wealthy girl explains to the troublemaking boy that she’s eating sushi—“rice, raw fish, and seaweed”— and the working-class delinquent responds churlishly, “You won’t accept a guy’s tongue in your mouth, and you’re going to eat that?” Hughes used the scene to demonstrate the expanding global cosmopolitanism of wealthy Americans, even to poke fun at the quickness with which the upper class adopts chic cultural fads, and to contrast it with the provincial sensibilities of working-class Americans.

All this points to illustrate the position of sushi in the 1970's and 80's, a high class exotic food that captured the imagination and romanization of the foreign and fanciful Japan. Sushi marked your class, both in the sense of sophistication and the socio-economic position. Since then however, sushi has steadily climbed down the ladder of social hierarchy. More restaurants, competition, and the creation of American sushi such as sushi burritos, california rolls, tempura sushi, and other curious items has pushed sushi into a more everyday sort of meal. While high class sashimi and omakase restaurants still exist, one can find a package of sushi even at convenience stores and supermarkets. Interestingly enough, Japanese officials have become ""horrified with the liberties taken with their food overseas"", so much that the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries created a “Japanese Restaurant Authentication Plan” for the 50,000 some sushi restaurants around the world. Agricultural minister
Toshikatsu Matsuoka said:

>""What we are seeing now are restaurants that pretend to offer Japanese cooking but are really Korean, Chinese or Filipino,” adding, with no intended irony, “We must protect our food culture.”

Indeed, most sushi and Japanese restaurants in the United States are not owned or staffed by Japanese, but instead of other Asians/Asian Americans. While the authentication program was abandoned over poor media coverage, it shows the changes in sushi landscape from the initial exotic luxury connotations of 70's and 80's to popular global staples of our present day. Much much more can be said about both sushi history and how it symbolizes and reflects the interactions of culture and Asian identity, but for now this should answer the question about the scene in *The Breakfast Club*.

"More of a legal answer than necessarily a historical answer, but, at least in American Supreme Court jurisprudence of the 20th century with which I'm familiar, these kinds of comments are fairly common really and sometimes eventually effective. See, e.g., Justice Harlan Stone's fourth footnote in his 1938 decision of United States v. Carolene Products Company, which suggested a more stringent standard than the rational basis test for future, hypothetical situations and which eventually led to the establishment of the concept of levels of judicial scrutiny and of strict scrutiny. This was ultimately a foundational development to modern constitutional jurisprudence. Thomas actually references this foot note specifically in his recent dissent in Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt. You can read Stone's decision here: https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/304/144/


What these kinds of comments and occasional legal suggestions or hypotheticals are is something called ""obiter dictum"" (sometimes just ""dicta"") in fancy law Latin, but it essentially just means any commentary in the decision of a case that is not necessary to reach the actual legal resolution of the controversies at issue in the case. Dicta is not binding, even if contained in a binding decision of the Court. It is noteworthy that the determination of what exactly is dicta and what is actually the holding of any given decision can be fraught with argument and the exact definitions of each of these terms is still being explored. See e.g.: https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2498&context=faculty_publications


However, statements like Thomas's or Stone's call for reevaluation of any legal standard under some hypothetical future challenge or whatever have you would be easily classified as pure dicta because those considerations are wholly external to deciding the actual controversy before them in the given case. When used by a justice of the Supreme Court these comments can be and often are legitimately made with the intent to shape the trajectory of legal development going forward however those justices see fit. The real potential weight of this kind of dicta to actually cause change can probably be measured by the number of justices joining in the opinion containing that dicta. So a single justice writing a lone dissent probably won't drive legislative developments or novel legal challenges in the same way that a statement in a majority opinion might. 


Ultimately, the inclusion of dicta and even dicta advocating for a specific future legal development or change is not a distressing departure from any judicial norms in concept. However, it is important to note that the specific legal changes suggested in dicta might themselves be extreme or distressing fringe legal theories that probably should color your perception of a given Justice's biases or understanding of the law."
"Lawyer here with a background in constitutional history and federalism. The answer largely requires understanding the purpose of the Constitution. At the time it was drafted, there was little concept of a nation of “Americans.” There was a nation of North Carolina, a nation of Massachusetts, a nation of New York, etc. The constitutional convention was an effort to find ways these many small nations could work together to strengthen each other. This required giving up some of their sovereignty to a new federal government. But they were very skeptical of doing so, and states wanted to retain as much sovereignty as possible.


Therefore, the approach was not to create a federal government with broad powers, but rather to only assign it specific and limited powers—namely, those powers that the states couldn’t really handle themselves. That’s why the Constitution specifically gives the federal government power over things like interstate commerce and foreign diplomacy. These are things that require some syncing up and that one state simply cannot deal with on its own. 


But here’s the key point: *Any power not specifically assigned by the Constitution to the federal government remained (and still remains) with the states.* So if there was anything at all—no matter how big or small—that needed to be handled by the federal government, it **had** to be specifically mentioned in the Constitution. 


With respect to the Post Office, you can start to see how the mentality of early Americans on this point would naturally lead to it being included in the Constitution. Each state’s leaders would have seen mail services as something that any one state can’t really deal with on its own. Why have 13 different mail systems with different standards, when that power could just be assigned to the federal government and be much more efficient? So they decided to assign it to the federal government. And given the constitutional setup—all power with the states except what we have specifically designated as belonging to the feds—it therefore had to be listed in the Constitution by name."

Pulp fiction itself often carried a low opinion among the masses, and this may have risen to the level of moral panic in some instances; Lovecraft often mentioned an apocryphal episode where the issue of *Weird Tales* with the story ""The Loved Dead"" was supposedly banned, but no-one has been able to confirm if that actually happened. One of the biggest hurdles for science fiction was simply to rise to mainstream acceptance as more than low-class literature."

"Zoroastrianism as it exists in the modern era (basically, 19th-century and beyond) is a whole subject unto itself, but there has basically been a fair amount of interaction between the Zoroastrian community, and Western scholars who began re-translating and re-interpreting the oldest extant Zoroastrian material. That has existed, of course, in a state of some tension with conservative Zoroastrian clergy, especially in India. That's in addition to some changes in understanding that occured under Islamic rule.

Basically, Zoroastrianism is ""the same"" in that (mostly) the same canon of texts have been used, the same rituals have been performed, the same prayers have been said, etc, for a very long time. But the social context it exists within is certainly completely different from 2000 or so years ago, and I think it would be very hard to argue that the general understanding of the religion by its practitioners has not changed over time as well.

Needless to say, this is true of all religions to some degree over such timeframes. Judaism today is not the same as it was before the destruction of the second temple, for a reasonably parallel example."
"The Chinese imperial court *looooved* their censuses... and why shouldn't they? After all, have as accurate a count of their population as possible ensured that they be receiving the maximum appropriate tax due to them.  As such, Chinese census data stretches back as far as the imperium itself, which sheds light on not only the effects of the Mongol Explosion across East Asia, but many other massive events as well.

But anyways, as to your question...

#The Effects of the Mongols on China.

We draw our numbers from both the imperial censuses themselves, but also from a number of modern ""estimates"" of true population size. The discrepancy comes from the fact that for a variety of reasons - untaxed or untaxable populations therefore left uncounted, criminal or otherwise governmentally-averse elements seeking to avoid such agencies, misrepresentation by local and regional officials to potentially ""understate"" their territory's ""value"" to the court (and maybe pocketing the difference, and on that note, as per Kent G. Deng (2003), the modern ideological problem that views ""the Chinese empire system [as] inefficient and backward, run by incompetent, rent-seeking bureaucrats who did nothing but cultivating long fingernails. This vision fits in well with Marxist claim that mandarins were little more than economic parasites in society."" This certainly fits with the 20th-21st century Chinese take on such estimates, along with the modernist philosophy of ""we know better.""

Anyways, let's take a look at the numbers...

By all counts, China under the Song Dynasty had reached a population high-water mark by  the turn of the 13th century, with the official census logging a little over 75 million people across the empire. More modern estimates put this number significantly higher, though. For instance, the 1978 estimate by McEvedy-Jones puts the total Chinese population that same year at almost 120 million, while Chao (1986) puts Song China over the top of 120 million even earlier - as of 1120, and a later estimate by Maddison (1998) for the year 1280 top out at a ""mere"" 100 million.

What is universally evident is the precipitous drop-off in China's population following the creation of Temujin into Genghis Khan and his launching of all-out war against the Song state following the falls of the Jin and Western Xia northern dynasties.  Let's go through cesuses one-by-one...

**Official census (averaged over 3 terms to *smooth out* the kinks, all numbers approximate except where noted):**

* 1195: 75 million

* 1291: 70 million

* 1330: 68 million

* 1393 (the first census taken by the Ming Dynasty): 60,545,812*

*actual number

So that right there is a drop of 15 million over the course of Mongol rule. *And granted, that includes not just killed but also the dispossessed, those who fled, and those who just went ""off grid"".*  But the numbers get even more stark looking at the more modern attempt to estimate the ""true"" size of China at this time.

All of the estimates effectively ""bottom out"" at the same number: the  60.5 million in 1693. But assuming one takes the modern estimates over the official census date, the results are far more dramatic - depending on which ""high-water"" estimate you choose to take, China lost anywhere 40-60 million people alone - *again those include much more than deaths, but also people just falling off the database for any number of other reasons.*

Deng's own re-adjustment is as follows:

* 1195: 112,666,595 

* 1291: 59,848,960 

* 1330: 77,322,033 

* 1381: 59,973,305 

Still, no matter how you slice it it's almost unthinkably huge at even the most conservative estimate. Somewhere between 1/5 and 1/2 of China's total population vanished in the course of less than 2 centuries.

**And that from a total global population in 1200 of between 360 and 430 million people in 1400.**

That is to say that in China alone, somewhere between 4-17% of the entire global population vanished from the books over the course of the Mongol Yuan reign. It's notable that between 1200 and 1400, total global population estimates actually dipped *overall* by between 10 and 66 million. This is not just because of direct slaughter, but probably even more so the fallout effects of the disruption of the planting/harvest cycles of agrarian civilizations affected by the Mongol disruption - leading to famines that could last years after the Mongols had vanished over the horizon.

Suffice it to say, estimates of the Mongols being responsible for the deaths of 40 million are plausible, and perhaps even toward the lower-mid range of the spectrum of estimates.

"I can find at least one contemporary attestation of this kind of thing happening, from no less authoritative a source than James, Duke of York—the future King James II—writing about the 1642 Battle of Edgehill (one of the first major battles of the First English Civil War). The quote below comes from *All the King's Armies: A Military History of the English Civil War 1642-1651*, by Stuart Reid; for the account from James, he cites Peter Young's book *Edgehill 1642: The Campaign and the Battle*.

>While it seems to have been by no means uncommon for pikemen to throw down their pikes and fall on with swords, deliberate encounters between two opposing stands of pikemen were generally conducted at 'push of pike'. This was by no means as dangerous as it might first appear, and hostile commentators such as Daniel Lupton claimed that it was virtually impossible for a pikeman to run someone through, even if he was only wearing a buffcoat. The real object of the exercise seems to have been to push the opposition back sufficiently violently to cause them to lose their footing, or better still to break and run. Nevertheless both sides needed to enter into the spirit of the occasion and, if one side was less thanm enthusaistic, the push might only be a token one with the reluctant party throwing down its pikes and giving way almost at once.

>**If neither side was too keen on the idea they might even be reduced to an ineffective 'foyning' or fencing, standing off at a pike's length and going through the motions of jabbing at each other while they waited for something to turn up**. After the initial clash the infantry battle at Edgehill in 1642 seems to have settled down into an affair of this kind:

>>When the Royalist army was advanced within musket shot of the enemy [wrote the future King James] the foot on both sides began to give fire, the King's coming on and the Rebells continuing only to keep their ground, so that they came so near one another that some of the battalions were at push of pike, particularly the regiment of the Guards ... The foot thus being engaged in such warm and close service, it were reasonable to suppose that one side shuld run and be disordered; but it happened otherwise, for **each as if by mutual consent retired some few paces, and then struck down their colours, continuing to fire at each other even until night, a thing so extraordinary as nothing less than so many witnesses as were present could make it credible**.

I have not been able to find evidence that this kind of behavior was widespread, however. Whether or not push-of-pike engagements were ""by no means as dangerous as it might first appear,"" they were often real knock-down, drag-out affairs: one excruciating push at the Battle of Torrington in 1646 is reported to have lasted *two hours*. Different sources claim different things about the typical fatality rates of push-of-pike engagements, but in some cases the pushing would give way to what was called ""bad war,"" when both sides would drop their pikes, draw swords and other close weapons, and engage in fierce, high-casualty hand-to-hand combat. At Edgehill, the foot soldiers on both sides were quite inexperienced (and, at least on the Royalist side, lightly armored), and it's possible that they were skittish about becoming engaged in this more violent and deadly phase of battle."
"Great write up. 
To add, I plugged your numbers into a mortgage calculator. That would come to a principle and interest payment of 705.23 per month at that initial rate of 13.88%. I’m not sure how much insurance and tax would be for the time. But it does seem like the Simpsons would be fine. Though it does seem like they would be pretty close month to month. With your estimated $1303.76 monthly income in 1984, that would leave 598.53 for taxes insurance, car payments, food, and other living expenses. Would that be enough in 1984?"
"Not disagreeing with anything here -- I like this answer and reiterate your call to avoid the pitfalls of hindsight. I just wanted to add on specifically regarding the part of the question regarding dissent. There was some dissent against the Augustan hegemony over power in the state, with a rather famous example being Lucius Licinius Varro Murena, who ended up in a somewhat complicated situation defending a fellow senator (Primus) who was accused of illegally prosecuting a war against Thrace. The defendant's argument was that he had been instructed to do so by Augustus; this wasn't technically in Augustus's official power under the terms of the division between senatorial and Augustan provinces, and Augustus himself appeared at the trial, apparently intending to use his auctoritas (authority, or very simply the air of respect and deference towards the powerful) to nip this line of argument in the bud. Murena was bold enough to point out that Augustus had not been called as a witness and that he really had no business taking part in the trial. Later that year, Murena was named (correctly? We just have no way of knowing) as part of a conspiracy against Augustus led by a Fannius Caepio, and was arrested and executed without trial.

It's fair to say, then, that there was certainly a party that saw Augustus as overstepping the boundaries of his prerogative and publicly confronting him over it, but it lacked the support to prevent Augustus from having his way, succeeding in the conviction of Primus and the execution of Murena. It should also be pointed out that strongmen getting more power than their colleagues were comfortable with and meeting opposition because of it were not new with Augustus, so this hardly constitutes a good reason to draw a line here with Augustus and say ""this is where the Republic ceases to be functional."""
"In a sense, yes... but there is a difference between posting an answer which is, in its entirety *""I am gonna go with Suge Knight, that dude is crazy""* and one which evaluates the known evidence, the possible motives, the opinions of experts who have studied the crime, and upon weighing those, arrives at the same conclusion. History is often like a puzzle, and you have bits and pieces which you need to fit together. As noted in the linked thread, ""this rule shouldn't be taken as disallowing any and all speculation"", because inferring from the evidence is one of the tools in an historian's arsenal. But ""that dude is crazy"" is not evidence, or at least, not sufficient evidence to venture an answer on."

Factors like foreign influence and natural disasters are pretty key in other areas. Persepolis itself is believed to have been burned down by Alexander the Great, though the actual circumstances are unclear.

Given how frequent earthquakes are in areas like Kermanshah or the Fars Province, there is monumental art and architecture that survives such as Behistun and  Naqshe Rostam.

"Thank you for your answer! I lived in Kathmandu for a year, and ended up watching a Nepali made movie that involved, among other things, the Maoist uprising. I knew something bad happened around the royal family, but no one really talked about it and I never got the sense that asking was a good idea. 

I was deep in the mountains one day, hanging out with some people who were fairly important on the village (school teacher and a hotel owner) when Someone Important stopped by. The tone of the conversation changed dramatically, and he got a cup of very nice tea and the nicest chair present. 

Later I found out he was an important local politician, knew everyone for 20 or 30 kilometers by name, and was big on the Maoist Party. And possibly a holdover from the fighting. 

It was really interesting to see an older style of politics - someone who sits and drinks tea with everyone, knows everyone’s business, and has a remarkable amount of sway and personal power. I guarantee you nothing happened in that district without him knowing about it one way or another, but he held no official office outside of the party."
"You're maybe wrong about your assumption about conquering sophisticated people rather than great tracts of land, but you're certainly overlooking several important things.

Caesar didn't just conquer Gaul - and remember that the Gauls were Rome's historical bogyman.  Caesar was born into a situation that put a spotlight on him.  His uncle Marius was the only Roman before Caesar to hold seven consulships, six of them consecutively, to fight off the threat of the Teutones and Cimbri (a Gallic/Germanic confederation), and became known as the ""third founder of Rome"" for that accomplishment.  Marius' party lost Rome's first civil war, and Sulla banned images of Marius from appearing in public.  When Caesar's aunt, Marius' wife, died, he gave the funeral oration and unilaterally rolled out the images of Marius for the funeral.  Caesar was 31.  That was the year he was elected quaestor, the lowest rank on the cursus honorum.  From this low position and sad occasion Caesar resurrected the memory of his uncle and made a direct connection between himself and Rome's third founder.

In 63, he was elected to both the office of praetor - one step away from the consulship - and the pontifex maximus - Rome's highest religious position.  He borrowed heavily to bribe voters, and had to sneak out of Rome to avoid his creditors to take up the governorship of Spain, but he won.

His civil war was not fought only (well, mostly, but let's not get complicated about it) in Italy like Sulla's was.  Caesar's war was fought in Italy, Greece, Egypt, Africa, and Spain.  When Caesar celebrated his triumph, it was the most lavish triumph ever celebrated up to that point.  It is known as the Quadruple Triumph, celebrating victories in Gaul, Egypt, Africa, and Pontus (that's the ""veni vidi vici"" campaign).  You can read about the extravagance of the Quadruple Triumph in Appian [here](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/appian-caesars-triumph/).

He DID NOT change the constitution of Rome from a republic to a dictatorship.  Dictator in the Roman system was a constitutional position; he simply applied it in new ways, and he wasn't the first to do so.  That was Sulla.  Caesar WAS the first Roman to put his own face on a coin.  His affair with Cleopatra was a famous scandal, and had political importance.  Cleopatra was the last of the Hellenistic monarchs, and Egypt was incredibly rich.  When she gave birth to Caesar's only male child (and living child, since Julia died ages ago), there was a real risk of an international crisis, depending on whether Caesar made the kid his heir.

I'll skip the details of the events following the civil war and the assassination.  Here's the kicker: he had really good press after he died.

Octavian, on hearing he was Caesar's heir, came to Rome with no levers of power.  He used his connection to Caesar to get leverage against Marc Antony first, and then against the assassins, and then against Marc Antony again.  He stressed pietas, one of the most important Roman virtues, as the driving force behind his project for killing the assassins.  During the course of his reign, he promoted his connection with Caesar, and also constructed parallels between himself and Aeneas, who also was famous for his pietas, in sponsoring work like the Aeneid.  If you want some scholarship on how Octavian (AKA Augustus) did this, you might start with *The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus* by Zanker.

I'm not able to say whether Caesar would not be iconic without Augustus' efforts at popularizing him, but I am certain that Augustus set out on purpose to make Caesar an icon, as Augustus' connection to Caesar was central to his own political power.  And he was quite successful at it, hence Caesar became a title rather than a name all the way into the 20th century, as you note."
"I would definitely believe that the Columbus thing in particular isn’t actually part of formal teaching standards. 

Since a lot of people have latched onto this example, however, and it’s a particularly egregious historical falsehood, I will say that I have a distinct memory of reading something in elementary school (in TN) about how Columbus’ own men during the expedition were afraid they were about reach the edge of the world and fall off; it was only when they started seeing ocean debris from a nearby landmass that they began to lose that fear.

I admittedly don’t remember the context in which this story was presented, so I can’t say for sure that it was intended to serve as a factual account. It’s certainly the sort of thing that makes me wonder, though...

EDIT: judging from [this article](http://www.history.com/news/christopher-columbus-never-set-out-to-prove-the-earth-was-round), I may have been reading an excerpt from Washington Irving’s fictionalized biography of Columbus, which is largely credited with spreading the myth in the first place.

EDIT 2: corrected spelling"
"> Historically and linguistically, what makes people categorize British/French/etc. accents as ""sexy"" and Asian/Indian accents as ""unattractive?""

One factor, and one factor alone -- their feelings toward the *speakers* of these languages and language varieties. 

Go back about 250 years and the dominant idea was that French was a serious, weighty language most suitable for *diplomacy*, while German was a romantic, expressive language, the ideal language for *poetry*. Yes, poetry. 

Nowadays, most would opine that French is sexy and most suitable for love, while German is a heavy, plodding, guttural language perhaps best suited for war, fighting and philosophy.

In this timeframe, French and German have changed very little, yet our attitudes about them have shifted a great deal. This goes to show that attitudes about languages come from the observer and his culture, not from the languages themselves.

Linguistically, these attitudes are of course all nonsense. Except to the extent that some linguists study these attitudes, as they can tell us a lot about speakers.

> ...if the human ear possesses a natural ""liking"" for certain phonetic structures and will classify those sounds as ""auditorily pleasing"" while ""disliking"" other phonetic combinations.

Neither the human ear nor what really matters, the brain, has an aesthetic preference for any one of the myriad sounds found in human language. Again, it's all about our attitudes toward speakers.

A great example of this is that both French and German have an /r/ sound that is a voiceless velar or uvular fricative. This is a ""rough"", ""guttural"" sound produced in the very back of the mouth by a powerful airstream that generates fairly intense aperiodic acoustic energy, which is the technical definition of ""noise"". 

English speakers tend to fixate on this sound when it's found in German, imitating it and pointing to it as proof that German is a ""harsh"" and ""guttural"" language. When the same or very similar sounds are heard in *French*, however, none of this happens, and French is nonetheless praised for being ""romantic"", ""mellifluous"", etc.

So we have the same sound classified in opposite ways depending on who uses it.  Again, because we project our attitudes toward speakers onto their language.

In the US we can see this in various manifestations. Take the /f/ sound, which is a voiceless labiodental fricative. In some words we don't even notice it, like ""half"" and ""finger"". It just is, and we pay no heed to it in such words. But the instant you put it in a word where the majority uses another sound, like ""with"" pronounced as ""wif"", alarm bells go off, and we label these speakers as ignorant or uneducated. Not because of the sound itself, which all English speakers produce, but because of *who* uses this sound in a set of words that normally has ""th"" -- in the US this feature is largely found in African-American English, which is spoken by what is called a ""low prestige"" group in sociolinguistics.

As a final example, let's take the voiced labio-velar approximant /r/. This is an /r/ you make with the lower lip touching the upper teeth, as when you say /v/. When Americans hear Brits use it they either pay no attention to it or they find it posh. When they hear other Americans use it, though, they either find it intensely infantile or they classify it as a speech defect!

It's all about *who* is speaking, not *how*."
That's the (xmas-y) spirit!
"What an amazing answer! 

Not OP, but thank you. I learned a lot."
Follow up: What percentage of that population was of the German population as a whole? I imagine you're citing numbers from different nations at the time?
"No.

In Classical Greece, my area of expertise, this certainly did not happen. I'm not as qualified to speak on other premodern eras or regions. But I think there's pretty good reason to assume that the large boardgame-like battle map wasn't actually used by any armed force anywhere until the mid-to-late 19th century. 

The first and most obvious point is that detailed maps of this kind didn't exist. Of course, map making goes back at least to the Late Archaic Greeks, but these maps were only rough visualisations of geographical knowledge. It took many centuries for trigonometry and other relevant fields of mathematics to develop to the point where accurate representations of 3-dimensional space on a 2-dimensional plane were even feasible.

Now, you might say that this is irrelevant because there's no need for an *accurate* map when planning broad strategical manoeuvres. An outline of the country and its cities and geographical features will do. But that's putting the cart before the horse. The point is that it wasn't until militaries realised their need of good maps that they started making such maps. This is what drove the development of detailed map making in the first place. The reason people in Antiquity didn't have maps like ours is because their commanders *did not see the need for such maps.*

It can be hard for us to wrap our heads around this. We modern people learn to think of space in terms of maps. We visualise everything from countries to transportation networks to buildings in a top-down, schematic manner. We are accustomed to situating ourselves in space by coordinates on a flat grid. We learn to understand notions like compass points, scale, and legend. When we play strategy games, we take it for granted that there will be a geographical map and a strategic map and a battle minimap and whatever else - visual aides that allow us to understand where we are and what's going on. But this is because in our day, such maps are widely available. Universal digital maps have replaced partial physical maps; we are the first generation of humans that can see exactly where we are on the globe anywhere at any time. People in Antiquity did not have such tools. Unsurprisingly, they thought of space very differently.

When you read accounts of Greek military campaigns, and accounts of Greek generals debating strategy and tactics, you'll never find a single reference to a map. Instead, space is conceptualised as a number of known routes from one location to another; as a succession of conjoined territories occupied by different peoples; as a number of days' marching or sailing; as the area around notable features, like mountains, rivers, cities or sanctuaries; and as ground where an army can or cannot pass or deploy for battle. In other words, space is not defined in terms of abstract schematics, but in terms of observed reality and relevant knowledge. If a Greek general needed information about terrain, he would seek out a local guide. If he needed to plan a campaign, he would rely on common knowledge about the distance to the target and the roads one took to get there. 

I'll show you how this works. Herodotos describes how the tyrant Aristagoras tried to convince the Spartan king Kleomenes to support his rebellion against Persia in 499 BC. This scene is the only time in Greek history that a map is used to support war planning. But it doesn't go as we'd expect:

> ""The lands in which they dwell lie next to each other, as I shall show: next to the Ionians are the Lydians, who inhabit a good land and have great store of silver."" This he said, pointing to the map of the earth which he had brought engraved on the tablet. ""Next to the Lydians,"" said Aristagoras, ""you see the Phrygians to the east, men that of all known to me are the richest in flocks and in the fruits of the earth..."" [he goes on to describe one people after another]

> Kleomenes asked Aristagoras how many days' journey it was from the Ionian sea to the king [of Persia]. Till now, Aristagoras had been cunning and fooled the Spartan well, but here he made a false step. If he desired to take the Spartans away into Asia he should never have told the truth. But he did tell it, and said that it was a three months' journey inland. 

> At that, Kleomenes cut short Aristagoras' account of the prospective journey. He then bade his Milesian guest depart from Sparta before sunset, for never, he said, would the Lakedaimonians listen to the plan, if Aristagoras desired to lead them a three months' journey from the sea.

-- Hdt. 5.49-50

First, Kleomenes clearly struggles with the concept of a map, and Aristagoras effectively translates the image into ethnographical  information that will make sense to him. Second, Kleomenes does not independently grasp the scale of what he's seeing, and needs that translated as well. Once he is told what the map really means - once it is reduced to the key information on which he would base his own war planning - he immediately dismisses Aristagoras and abandons the Greeks of Asia to their fate.

We can speculate how useful detailed maps would have been to the Greeks in their many wars, and how much easier a well-informed strategist and tactician would have found it to wage their campaigns. But the point is that, to them, it was not needed. They knew the land, and if they didn't they would explore it on the spot or simply ask someone about it. All they needed to know was easily conveyed by word of mouth and didn't need to be complicated by abstraction and projection. Why would they develop sophisticated map making techniques, or ponder large map tables as they considered their plan for the next campaign?

Most commanders throughout premodern history will have agreed with Herodotos that maps, in all their abstraction and distortion, can decieve as easily as they can inform. They would argue that maps may be useful in navigation, and in the visualisation of ideal geographies or past events, but that they are not the most efficient way to convey the critical information needed to wage war. So where does the notion of the big tactical and strategic map come from?

This may be only a partial explanation, but a key driver of military map making in Europe was the sense of Napoleon's enemies that they had been beaten by superior knowledge, and that the only way to prevent such humiliation was to take preparation for future wars seriously. This had never been done at any scale on an institutional level. In Prussia, the establishment of the Great General Staff in 1824 triggered the first wave of government-sanctioned mapping for the use of the military; in the course of the 19th century, Prussian map makers became leaders in the production of high-quality, accurate maps for both tactical and strategic purposes. As other European powers followed their lead, all of Europe was mapped out in meticulous detail for the first time. Most of the maps used today are still built on the results of this military initiative.

The war exercises of the Great General Staff focused heavily on the use of maps for the gathering of information, the weighing of possibilities and the giving of orders. The first thing you did as a participant of such exercises was receive and take stock of your maps. At the same time, efforts to train officers in different ways also spurred the development of war games more similar to modern board games like *Risk*, with tokens in different colours moved around stylised maps and encounters resolved by dice rolls. As the Prussian victories of 1864-1871 cemented the status of their staff as the most effective military organisation in the world (deserved or otherwise), other powers made it their business to learn from Prussian ways, and this probably did a lot to solidify the idea that proper military training involved abstracting tactical problems into maps and tokens, and proper military planning was done around big, detailed, carefully compiled tactical and strategic maps.

The large map has become such a fixture of battle planning scenes in war movies (based on real map rooms and map tables like the ones still visible in the [Cabinet War Rooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_War_Rooms#/media/File:MapRoomCabinetWarRoomsTrim.jpg) and the [Battle of Britain bunker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Plotting_Table.jpg/1200px-Plotting_Table.jpg) in London) that we now *expect* maps and tokens to be there, even if the story is set as far back as Antiquity. We struggle to imagine another way for a council of commanders to survey the situation and decide on a plan. It gives a delightful visualisation of the setup as it is explained to the viewer, and it allows characters to pore over maps brooding, which is how we imagine the tactical mastermind. *Game of Thrones* is a particularly serious offender, with large strategic maps appearing as decorative furniture in Dragonstone, as a floor mosaic in King's Landing, and as a tabletop game in Winterfell. 

But none of this is even slightly historical. The peoples of the time period that inspired *Game of Thrones* did not have such maps, or the way of thinking about tactics and strategy that would have produced them. We are just projecting what we've come to think of as normal into an imagined past."
"Like any big city, Rome was both a single idea and infinitely splintered reality - each street part of a system, every neighborhood a building block of the metropolis. And as in any big city, the ways its inhabitants experienced part and whole must have varied. Unfortunately, despite all the vivid detail provided by the letters of Cicero and the epigrams of Martial and Juvenal, our literary sources really tell us only how Roman elites liked to think and talk about life in Rome - potentially a very different thing from lived experience. Archaeology brings us closer to the sweat and dirt, but often merely in the sense of establishing the essentials of the physical setting. Your question, in other words, ain't easy to answer. But I'll take a wild stab at it. 

Rome was indeed big - by ancient standards, almost unimaginably so, to the point that it strained even the High Empire's ability to requisition resources and funnel them into Italy. But for its size, the city was quite dense. Most Romans famously lived in insulae - apartment blocks - three or four stories high, built cheek-by-jowl along every street and alley (building regulations stipulating space between apartments were blithely ignored). The five or so square miles eventually enclosed by the Aurelian Walls contained the great bulk of Rome's million inhabitants. Almost no part of the city was more than a few miles from any other part; and if you knew where you were going, you could probably walk almost anywhere in little more than an hour. Unless you want to count the litters occasionally hired by members of the elite, there was no public transportation (with the exception of construction carts, in fact, all wheeled traffic was banned from the streets for most of the day). But that didn't matter, since from any given neighborhood, a sufficiently determined pedestrian could walk almost anywhere worth going in a relatively short time. 

Although we have no way of proving (save by analogy with early modern European cities), it is likely that most Romans, like most premodern urbanites, worked near their residences. Local ties were strong in Rome, as the existence of the 265 vici (neighborhood organizations, each with its own magistrates and public cult) suggests. (One might also point to the odd festival of the October Horse, during which representatives of two neighborhoods competed for the head of the eponymous animal.) It should be remembered, however, that the great festivals of the Roman calendar brought all Romans into the ritual centers of the city, as did the combats in the Colosseum and the races in the Circus Maximus. Although Romans probably spent most of their lives in their neighborhoods, they would have never have forgotten that they were residents of a single city, and could never have doubted that their city was the greatest on Earth."
"Yeah, for some reason people portray Lincoln's childhood as utterly destitute. This sort of story goes back to Lincoln's lifetime. But it isn't true. His father had deep flaws and was born poor. But by the time Lincoln was born he was a reasonably successful carpenter and farmer.

However, Abraham's father also had a large family and would get caught up in boundary disputes and other expensive lawsuits. Lincoln didn't grow up rich. But he always had a roof over his head, three meals a day, and the basic necessities. What he didn't always have was nice things. For example, he lacked the formal clothes to attend a wedding at one point. And like many working class children he was expected to help out with his father's work.

I can't attest to every house Lincoln lived in but the ones I do know about were decently built. His father was a carpenter, after all. Nor have I heard that his father was an impulsive spender or an alcoholic. And the land he set his farms on was mostly good land. The failures of the farm in Kentucky, for example, were due to his father losing lawsuits over boundaries or ownership.

In short, Lincoln's family, like many working class families even today, often had to stretch their money and scrimp or save for middle class basics. But they were never anything close to homeless or starving. At least not in Lincoln's lifetime: his father was genuinely very poor for a time, though not during Lincoln's life.

If I might be obliged some historiographical speculation, I *suspect* that the elite and urban backgrounds of historians and writers mistook a fairly normal working class family for someone living in poverty. *They* had never limited their use of heating in the winter so they assumed anyone who had was in complete poverty. And they had no idea how to judge the relative status of a log cabin as opposed to other forms of housing. And so on.

But as a rule, the poorest classes do not have skilled trades, significant savings, or a thousand acre farm on desirable land. Nor the money to engage in multi-year lawsuits."
"Similarly, what was the immigration policy like for the confederacy?"
"Gosh, what a great question! It's such a great question, in fact, that **there is no definitive answer to it.** (Maybe you can be the person who [trawls the Nixon tapes](http://nixontapes.org/) and finds the answer.)

Before I start the discussion, it might be worth pointing out something that you (well, maybe not *you* in particular /u/TrynnaFindaBalance, but *you* collectively, as in everyone reading this) might have overlooked.

What's obvious to us today, with the benefit of hindsight, was not clear to Nixon or anyone else in the United States in early 1972. We know the results, and so we have an artificial assurance that because things turned out they way they did, they *must* have turned out that way. Living in the moment is to live in uncertainty.

At the start of 1972, opinion polls showed Nixon and the various Democratic contenders in a close contest. [Sen. Edmund Muskie was considered a strong candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/31/archives/nixon-and-muskie-nearly-even-at-43-and-42-in-gallup-poll.html), and Nixon feared facing Alabama Gov. George Wallace (who was ultimately incapacitated in a May 1972 assassination attempt). 

At the start of the year, when G. Gordon Liddy and Attorney General John Mitchell discussed the campaign to harass and sabotage the Democratic Party, Nixon's wide victory wasn't yet apparent. That would come later.

It's also important to remember that the June break-in — for which Gonzales, Barker, McCord, Martinez, and Sturgis became infamous — was only part of the campaign approved by Nixon's backers (including Liddy). That campaign also included wiretapping and other kinds of snooping. **Remember that Nixon himself may not have been aware of the exact activities: It was the coverup that got him in trouble.**

But that doesn't get to your key question: ""What were the burglars after?""

There are *a ton* of fun theories about this. The most popular theory is that Nixon believed that Democratic National Committee chairman Lawrence O'Brien had some dirt on a loan given by billionaire Howard Hughes (yes, of Spruce Goose and ""The Aviator"" fame) to Nixon in 1969. Some of that money, [according to reporting by ""60 Minutes,""](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-aviator-connection/) went to paying for frills at Nixon's Key Biscayne home.

[E. Howard Hunt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ex-spy-crafted-watergate-other-schemes/2012/05/31/gJQAh80uFV_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d90adae4247e), who hired the burglars, told the *Miami Herald* in 1997 that they were actually looking for ties between the Democratic National Committee and foreign governments. They were searching for evidence of foreign campaign contributions (something that might be familiar to Americans lately), which would make great dirt in the election that year.

“What we were looking for is the same thing every congressional committee is looking for today, which was evidence of illegal foreign contributions,” he told *Herald*. “That was the rationale for going in there. We’d heard rumors that both the Vietnamese and Fidel Castro were inserting funds illegally into the Democratic National Committee. And the idea was to look at the books, photograph them, in and out, and that’s it. It didn’t seem like such a deal to me. You know, I’d been doing that stuff for years, a ‘black-bag job’ into other embassies. But you know, I didn’t have skilled people.”

In 2001, [Liddy testified that the burglars weren't after anything political](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/30/us/g-gordon-liddy-gives-first-testimony-on-watergate-break-in.html): They were actually looking for photographs that put the wife of White House counsel John Dean into a call-girl ring. 

Contemporaneous rumors held that the motive behind the burglary was to find evidence held by the Democrats that linked Nixon to various assassination attempts made by the United States against Fidel Castro. A lot of those rumors stemmed from the fact that the Watergate burglars had deep ties to anti-Castro plotters, and some Americans reveled in the idea that the nation's dirty tricks had come home to roost.

[Columnist George Will has an interesting theory](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/08/reason-watergate-george-will/) that ties the motive to events happening in the days surrounding the burglary. One year before the break-in, the *New York Times* began publishing the Pentagon Papers. Will has suggested that Nixon was worried that the Papers would expose Nixon's 1968 role in sabotaging peace talks related to the Vietnam War. Nixon's successful sabotage of those talks, revealed only in the past few years, violated the Logan Act of 1799. 

Regardless of the motive, it seems likely that Nixon himself had no particular knowledge of the June break-in, but he did know broadly about a campaign of ""dirty tricks"" against the Democratic Party to hamper Democrats' efforts to fight him in 1972. And as I said before, it wasn't the break-in that ultimately forced Nixon to resign: It was the cover-up. 

That's something worth remembering."

"The best way to think about the difference between the classical curriculum and the modern curriculum is to consider the role of history in a young person's education. In a classical curriculum, like the one the boy at Princeton in the 1700s would experience, history was secondary to Greek, Latin, and logic. He would learn about historical Great Men but it was in context of a Greek or Latin text. He might read about historical events, but it wasn't to learn the history, the history came along in the learning about something else. History - and literature - were seen as ""easier"" to learn than Greek, Latin, math, science, etc. and as such wasn't formally taught as often. (Which isn't to say there were never history lectures or courses. Rather, it wasn't given its own stand-alone course of study in the same way one would study Greek.) 

In contrast, the modern liberal arts curriculum includes history as a stand alone course. Young people study history explicitly to study history, independent of other content (unless they're doing something interdisciplinarity.)

"The funny thing is, when I've given this thesis as a talk (I've been working on it for several years), prior to 2016 I would always get one person in the audience who would say, ""are you telling me that you think it is possible that the President of the United States could be so out of the loop on something of this magnitude?"" But after November 2016, that question more or less has gone away — people find it easier _for some reason_ to believe that the President is just a person, and not some kind of omnipotent being.

But I digress: yes, that is what I am saying. One might ask, how could this be? Several answers present themselves: 1. it was not a household name of a city in the US at the time (I have done many searches through historical newspapers — it was not one of the city names that featured in practically any national news coverage prior to August 6, 1945), 2. Truman was the last US President to lack a college education (not a sin, but still), 3. Truman had no experience in foreign affairs prior to FDR's death (and FDR did not give him any insights into his own thinking, which probably was a sin), 4. Truman went through all of these discussions while at the Potsdam Conference, where he was (in his own telling of it) totally overwhelmed with the competition for his attention from the many fateful issues that were in front of him, 5. by the account of those who worked close to him, he was not by nature inquisitive or prone to micromanagement or asking close questions, and, most importantly, 6. it was presented to him as a major military base and target by his Secretary of War, in the only conversations he would have about the targeting questions.

Given all of the above, and Truman's own fallibility (which he himself would have vouched for), I think it is entirely plausible that he was confused as to the nature of what was being targeted for the first use of the atomic bomb (which, as an aside, was the only thing he concerned himself with — you may be even more surprised to hear that I don't think Truman even knew that another one was going to follow on its heels within a few days, so fixated was he and everyone else at Potsdam on the _first_ use of the bomb)."
"> So her story seems to me to be somewhat the opposite of what you described above - the attempt to make a non-white person as white as possible.  Instead of moving West, she was moved East.

This is not uncommon in places of European colonisation during the 19th and 20th centuries.

It happened in Australia too, under the government policy of 'Assimilation'. We call it the Stolen Generation. Mixed race Indigenous kids were taken from their families and raised by white settlers. They idea was that they could be trained to be like whites, and then they would marry other whites. After a few generations, their blackness would be totally diluted. We recognise now that it was part of an effort to effectively genocide the Indigenous people. Colonialism sucks, to say the least. 

And sadly, to a large degree it worked. Most Indigenous people I know are white-passing. It shows the visible lasting impact of decades of institutionalised racism. Let alone the emotional and cultural impact.

The Stolen Generation one of the most shameful moments of Australia's national history. Our government recently apologised to the Indigenous community for it. It was the least they could do."

> [...] We were right opposite Washington's headquarters. I saw him every day.""

> *""Was he as fine a looking man as he is reported to have been?"".*

> ""Oh!"" he exclaimed, lifting up both his hands and pausing, ""but you never got a smile out of him. He was a nice man. We loved him. They'd sell their lives for him.""

> *I asked, ""What do you think he would say if he was here now?""*

> ""Say!"" exclaimed he, ""I don't know, but he'd be mad to see me sitting here. I tell 'em if they'll give me a horse I'll go as it is. If the rebels come here, I shall sartingly take my gun. I can see best furtherest off.""

His brother was out through the whole war of the Revolution. He has a grandson now in the army, an officer in the Department of the Gulf, - a noble looking young man, as represented by his photograph. He has been in the service from the beginning of the war.

> '""When peace was declared,"" said the old man, concluding his story of the war, ""we burnt thirteen candles in every hut, one for each State.""

> [...]

> By religious persuasion, Mr. Downing is a Methodist. ""Why,"" said he, ""I'll tell you: because they are opposed to slavery, and believe in a free salvation.""

> **Daniel Waldo**

> Mr. Waldo never saw either Washington or La Fayette. He served for a short time as chaplain at New London, in the year 1812. In the present conflict with rebellion he was intensely loyal, greatly desiring to live till the rebellion should be suppressed. He had implicit faith in the ultimate success of the Union arms and the re-establishment of the authority of the National Government over all the states.

> President Lincoln he deemed honest, but not decided enough. He thought that the leaders of the rebellion should be dealt with in such a manner that no one would dare, in the future, to repeat the experiment.

> **Lemuel Cook**

> Speaking of the present war, he said, in his strong tones, at the same time bringing down his cane with force upon the floor, ""it is terrible; but, terrible as it is, the rebellion must be put down!""

> **Alexander Milliner**

> In the present conflict with treason, Mr. Milliner's sympathies, as with all his surviving Revolutionary comrades, are enlisted most strongly on the side of the Union; he declaring that it is ""too bad that this country, so hardly got, should be destroyed by its own people."" He inquires every day or two about the army; and expresses the desire to live to see the rebellion crushed. At the outbreak of it, he wanted to take his drum and go down to Rochester, and beat for volunteers. Two years ago, in September, he presided over a meeting for raising recruits for the One Hundred and Fortieth New York Regiment. His presence at the meeting, it is said, caused great excitement and enthusiasm.

> **William Hutchings**

> He is deeply interested in the present conflict, his whole soul being enlisted in the cause of his country. Speaking of General Grant and his prospects of success in his campaign against Richmond, he concluded by saying, ""Well, I know two old folks up here in Maine who are praying for him.""

> He has lost four or five grand-children in the war.

> His views on the subject of slavery are radical, he declaring that ""God will never suffer it to exist in this country''

> **Adam Link**

> In politics, Mr. Link declared himself a ""Jeffersonian Democrat;"" though his last vote was Republican. He said but little about the present war, frequently forgetting that one was in progress, and when reminded of it, he failed altogether to comprehend it. One of his great-grand-sons is in the army.

"Yes, static shocks are something we seem to have no record of specifically, from what I have read on the topic (it's of course hard to prove a negative, and I haven't pored over every scrap of Greek manuscript, so something could turn up, of course). For example, you might expect Pliny to talk about static electricity when he talks about wool, because wool was of course around at the time, and can be charged in the right way [...but Pliny doesn't discuss anything like that when he discusses wool](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D73). Whether that's because he personally didn't know about it, or forgot to write about it, who knows! 

Obviously much ancient writing has been lost; perhaps Diphilus with his experiments on torpedos *did* discuss static shocks at length in his lost work on the topic. So I'd be hesitant to argue that they weren't discussed at all, that ancient writers never experienced them (and it should go without saying that I'm only talking about a very particular 'Western' tradition of thought which is certainly not the only one that exists; I'm more than happy for other people to discuss how static shocks might have been discussed within other pre-modern cultures). 

What I was aiming for in reposting this answer here was to give an account of what we do know about what Ancient Greek/Roman writers thought about the natural world more generally, and then more specifically what they thought about closely related 'electricity' topics, to give a sense of how they would likely have thought about this specific topic."

"Complete replacement of organic material with mineral is not common for vertebrate fossils. Permineralization replaces the empty spaces in hard tissues with new minerals, but does not destroy the original bone (remember that bone is mostly the mineral hydroxyapatite already). So you can use the radiocarbon dating on the original bone that was deposited during life, and use other isotopic techniques to study aspects of diet and environment.

It's also worth noting that carbon dating itself only works for the last few hundred thousand years, due to the very short half life of Carbon-14. Other radioisotope decay patterns are used for older animals, and usually involve dating minerals in volcanic rocks to bracket the age of fossil-bearing rock localities."

"I am a scholar neither of Buddhism nor of Buddhist art. Since I have, however, had occasion to read about the Indo-Greek origins of Buddhist monumental sculpture, I'd like to offer a few provisional comments while we wait for an actual expert on the topic.

First, to make an obvious point, most of those mega-Buddhas were set up in the last 25 years, and should thus be interpreted in the contexts of national/regional pride and modern economic strength. They do, however, draw on an ancient tradition of colossal sculpture - as attested by the world's 18th tallest statue, a ninth-century Buddha near Leshan, China. 

I cannot pretend to trace the combination of religious, economic, and political factors that underpinned the creation of any particular image. But I can call attention to the fact that the tradition of monumental sculpture in Buddhism was very likely inspired, at least in broad outline, by Greek artistic conventions. 

After Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire, substantial numbers of Greeks settled in Bactria - roughly northern  Afghanistan and Tajikistan - bringing their language and culture with them. To take a famous example, Ai-Khanoum, a Greek city in the heart of northern Afghanistan, had every amenity of a Hellenistic polis: a gymnasium, a theater, and - most pertinently - dozens of statues depicting gods, heroes, and local worthies. A few of these statues, such as the cult image of Zeus in the city's primary temple, were colossal. 

Ai-Khanoum itself was wiped off the map by nomads in the mid-second century, and the Greek kingdom of Bactria lasted little longer. Many of the Greek settlers, however, fled south into what is now northern Pakistan and northwestern India, which had been a province of the Bactrian kingdom. In this region, a motley assortment of Greek kings reigned, and occasionally ruled, for another century and a half, presiding over a realm in which Greek religion and Greek art coexisted and intermingled with their Indian counterparts. A remarkable number of Greeks converted to - or at least publicly expressed sympathy for - Buddhism, describing themselves as ""Yavanas"" (a corruption of ""Ionians"") in dedicatory inscriptions etched into the walls of Buddhist caves. 

The Indo-Greek kingdom disintegrated around the end of the first century BCE, and its territories were soon absorbed by the great Kushan Empire. But in Gandhara, part of the old Indo-Greek heartland, a remarkable artistic tradition, clearly inspired by Hellenistic conventions, continued to thrive. There is some scholarly debate over whether the Greek element so evident in Gandhara art should be understood in terms of Indo-Greek survival or fresh influence conveyed via the Hellenophile Parthians. Whatever its sources, however, the depth of this Greek influence is impossible to deny. 

It was in Gandhara, and during the first century flowering of that region's characteristic Greco-Buddhist art, that some of the earliest known sculptural representations of the Buddha appeared. Until this point, the Buddha had been represented aniconically - often by footprints, a tree, or a stupa. Now, in Gandhara, he began to be represented as a man, in statues that blended traditional Indian depictions of yakshas (nature spirits) with Hellenistic clothing and artistic conventions. [This statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhist_art#/media/File:Gandhara_Buddha_(tnm).jpeg) is a good example.

Sculpture on a monumental scale was not, of course, a purely Greek innovation. But it was the  Greek-inflected Gandhara tradition, which spread through the Kushan Empire, that dominated the iconography of the colossal (and now tragically destroyed) Bamiyan Buddhas, which may have been begun as early as the third century. As you can see in [this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan#/media/File:Buddha_of_Bamiyan.jpg), the robe of the larger Bamiyan Buddha was characterized by the Hellenistic-style drapery of the Gandhara style. 

Does this mean that the colossal statues of the Buddha carved in Central Asia and (later) in China and Japan were directly inspired by the great cult statues of Greek temples? Of course not. Artistic influence is never so simple. But I do think that, in the distant lineage of all the gargantuan Buddhas on Wikipedia's big statue list, you'd find a little Greek DNA. 

This, again, is only a partial answer. But I hope that it can at least complement the definitive response that a true expert will (hopefully) provide."
">  In the Boy Scouts of America there is a fraternal organization, the Order of the Arrow, founded in 1915 which uses a combination of Native American themes and Masonic traditions, especially in the ceremonies performed. Can we draw a connection between the Order of the Arrow (and for that matter Masonic tradition) with the 19th century romanticization of Native American culture?

""Yes plus.""

Unfortunately, my only relevant earlier answer just kind of breezes by this (it's about the [origins of summer camps](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3zlweb/when_was_the_heyday_of_summer_camps_what_brought/cynhh6d/)). But essentially: Robert Baden-Powell, the British army officer who founded the Boy Scouts, was inspired in large part by one of his American co-soldiers in Africa, Frederick Burnham. Burnham himself was white, but had grown up on a Lakota Sioux reservation. (Don't get your hopes up. Burnham also fought for the U.S. *against* Native armies and was an imperialist in Zimbabwe/Rhodesia.) Baden-Powell and Burnham met around 1896. Burnham's stories and skills gave some direction and...atmosphere? to Baden-Powell's growing conviction that Western children needed to learn outdoors skills.

Romanticization of Native America is all over similar movement contemporary/semi-contemporary with the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides/Scouts. I'm pretty sure the YMCA was still running Indian Guides and Indian Princesses groups in the 1990s, if not later, and I *think* those date from the 1920s or so."
"The entire modern concept of a ""restaurant"" is inextricably bound with one nation-based cuisine: France, of course. But (for example) 19th-century Americans weren't necessarily going to a restaurant because the cuisine was French, they were going because of what French cuisine symbolized in terms of haute culture.

I have an earlier answer that deals a little with the lure of the ""exotic"" as a major drawing point for some of the predecessors of restaurants, namely British coffeehouses, and then goes into how U.S. restaurants started off as French cuisine and then Americanized. (The *question* is sort of the reverse, but the answer has the info you're looking for!)

* [In America, ethnic restaurants (Italian, Chinese, Jewish, etc) started to appear when those immigrants arrived en masse in the early 20th century. What were the most popular types of restaurants before the 20th century?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7yeifc/in_america_ethnic_restaurants_italian_chinese/dugew8h/)

Macaroni and cheese. Even the finest American restaurants through the nineteenth century served *a lot* of macaroni and cheese.

Allow me to explain.

The arrival of the restaurant and the restaurant experience--that is, attending a sit-down establishment whose primary focus was providing food, for the primary of eating the specific food offered there--in America is usually linked to the 1820s and 30s, with the opening of restaurants like the Union Oyster House in Boston, and the revamping of Delmonico's in New York City into the trend-setter of elite cuisine. This wasn't the beginning of ""dining out,"" of course, and those traditions would continue.

The most important predecessors are, loosely speaking, taverns/inns (which often overlapped in function) and coffeehouses. Travelers needed a place to eat where they stayed, of course, and non-travelers wanted something to eat while they drank. ""Abundant but not delicate,"" was how Frances Trollope *delicately* described American tavern menus in 1832, and Scottish general James Edward Alexander (1803-1885) agreed wholeheartedly:

> [There were] Tables covered with meat, vegetables, preserved fruit, tea, coffee, and bread--both of maize and wheat--and soft hoe and waffel [sic] cakes...

> No ceremony was used; each man helped himself with his own knife and fork [from the serving dish] and reached across his neighbor...bones were picked with both hands, knives were drawn through the teeth with the edge to the lips...Beefsteaks, apple tart, and fish were seen on the same plate the one moment, and had disappeared the next!

Alexander describes a basic lineup of dishes--recognizable even to an international traveler without needing menu descriptions to inform what was being eaten. For some travelers, the lack of a description was both a curse and a blessing. In the 18th century, a Connecticut teacher and diarist had described one of her own inn...meals...as:

> a twisted thing like a cable, but something whiter...[which the cook laid] ""on the bord, tugg’d for life to bring it into a capacity to spread.

The tradition of eating connected with hosting would actually play a role in the evolution of ""dining out""--with increased and richer international travel came nicer travelers' quarters, that is to say, hotels; and with that came nicer eating rooms and eventually restaurants that catered to locals as well as travelers.

Coffeehouses also played a role in creating a public desire for dining out, in America as they had begun to do in England by the late 18th century. At first, coffeehouse culinary offerings had sought to mirror the exotic allure and reputation of coffee *from the East* with heavily spiced and candied foods. In England and America, ""France"" was as good as the East for exotic; pastries were also on offer in some places. But it turned out people really like to be social to eat as well as to drink (alcohol or caffeine). By 1800, coffeehouses had introduced [tables and booths](http://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00321/AN00321183_001_l.jpg), a [waitstaff](http://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00093/AN00093726_001_l.jpg), and sometimes the types of nicer food one would not necessary be used to at home paired with a nice glass of wine! John Byng, grouchy about the state of *provincial* coffeehouses on his travels through countrysides, dreamed of home:

> A London gentleman steps into a coffeehouse, orders venison,
and turtle, in the instant; and (if known) a delicious bottle of port or claret: upon a clean cloth, without form, he dines at the moment of his appetite and walks away at the moment, he is satisfied.

Delmonico's, usually considered the first American restaurant worthy of the name, actually started life as a coffeehouse serving pastries in 1827. But its proprietors presumably noticed their clientele's focus on the food, and took a risk. They bought the building next door and, over the 1830s, turned themselves into a fine-dining *restaurant*.

They were fighting an uphill battle. ""Abundant but not delicate"" remained the dominating perception of American cuisine. Charles Dickens was horrified by the rustic nature of the dishes he ate at New York's City Hotel in 1842--duck with olives, more duck, grilled mutton chops. To defend themselves, the hotel owners and cooks could point out he was emphasizing the wrong thing: he had been served *thirty-eight dishes*.

The preference for *abundant* remained even as more and more chefs strove for *delicate*. If we can use menus as a guide for what people were eating, a meal would consist of one or more appetizers (soups, salads, fish); an intervening course called an entree that was basically the chance for the cook to show off something fancy (visually as well as culinarily) without having to worry about actually satisfying the patrons' stomachs; the main course of roast meat or fowl accompanied by vegetable side dishes; and then *two* dessert courses.

American fine dining across the middle of the 19th century, spiraling ever-upward in its closing Gilded Age years, retained an Anglo-American core but took on French trappings. Yes, French cooking was already the standard aspirational cuisine--not just the word ""restaurant"" is French, but ""chef,"" ""a la carte"", even ""cuisine"" comes from the French for kitchen. So those roast duck and venison main courses were smothered in French sauces: Espagnole or poulette; or in English ones: Cumberland or jellies. And, of course, wine-based sauces in abundance.

Menus also feature some stock French and English dishes, like beef a la mode (which does not involve ice cream), pork with fried apples, lamb blanquette. Mutton was extremely popular, mostly owing to French influence rather than English. Hilariously, it was apparently also ""fine dining"" to feature modern American barbecue basics, namely, baked beans with pork or cooked in pork lard. 

And then there were the oysters and macaroni.

These were kind of the go-to menu fillers for restaurants that wanted to save some money while still offering expansive menu options. Macaroni specifically was an American staple from the 18th century; the first pasta factory in the U.S. was apparently established in 1798. This was a heritage of English rather than directly Italian influence. London cook and author William Verral's 1759 *Complete System of Cookery* provided two versions of macaroni and cheese, which were prepared by mixing the pasta, cream, and cheese and then baking the dish. The Americans were not to be outdone: they produced, among other things, the *Ladies' New Book of Cookery* with *nine* macaroni dishes, many being further riffs on macaroni with cheese (and cream and butter) cooked and recooked.

As the fine-dining scene developed, spearheaded by Delmonico's success and other cities' desire to be as happening as Manhattan, other dining-out options appeared on the scene. The first is actually the appearance of, as you say, ethnic eating establishments! These were founded either within an immigrant community to serve the social function of restaurants as well as the hunger-satisfying one; or as lunchtime quick-stops for wage workers (which would eventually evolve into diners). These places do seem to have appealed primarily or entirely to the specific immigrant community they were founded and run by, though.

The second was the rise of ice cream parlours! Although ice cream had been on elite restaurant menus as a final course since the 1830s, it was actually increasing attention to women's roles in public as consumers and shoppers that spurred the popularity of ice cream parlours. They were built and marketed as the *ladies'* alternative to saloons and taverns--places where alcohol (the man's/adult's drink) was not sold but sweet things (children's food) were.

In 1798, John Byng preached the refined, civilized glory of the London coffeehouse over the country bumpkin alehouse. In 1898, women ducked into ice cream parlours while out shopping, maybe with a kid in tow. I think it's really interesting how directly the evolution of ""dining out"" across the American 19th century mirrors and even reinforces social stratifications in society. But this just goes back to the coffeehouse owners of a earlier age, and the medieval feast hosts before them, who understood that food can be a social experience as much as a culinary one."

"Depends what you are having in mind when you think of the term ""gun control"". Certainly, the types legislation intended to target weapons defined by various legal schemes as 'Assault Weapons' is something that only starts to come into being in the 1980s, with California being at the forefront, and that of course post-dating Reagan's term as governor. This is part of a line which would eventually, in the '90s, lead to the Brady Bill and the Assault Weapons Ban. 

Reagan, while governor, signed a law in 1967 which outlawed the open carrying of firearms in the state, and which was a direct response to actions by the Black Panthers. The law doesn't really fit well within the scheme of gun control laws of the '80s onwards, when they became a major *partisan* issue, but rather at the time, the Mulford Act - named for the very conservative Republican legislator who backed it - was fairly uncontroversial. *Gun rights wasn't a major political issue* and the bigger drive here was racially motivated, with the law very clearly targeting the Panthers, who the year before had begun ""Police Patrols"", members who basically just walked around following police with loaded firearms, which was perfectly legal under California Law.

For a deeper dive there, try out Adam Winkler's *Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.*"
"In his paper [""Broken Cradle: Why is Ohio No Longer the Mother of Presidents?""](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275334235_Broken_Cradle_Why_is_Ohio_No_Longer_the_Mother_of_Presidents), political science professor James Melcher identifies six factors in Ohio's dominance at the presidential level during this period:

* It was ""a pivotal state in national elections"" and something of a battleground state. Although Melcher admits that the state leaned decidedly Republican, it still featured more ""partisan competitiveness"" than most others during the era. It worked as a bellwether for the Republican Party at the national level at the time, which is the party that all those Ohio presidents came from. If the Republicans could do well in Ohio, they could win the Presidential election.

* Ohio politicians of the era tended to be described at the time as ""bland"" and ""nonideological"", and not as partisan as politicians from other areas of the country. Melcher posits that this might be due to Ohio having multiple large population centers, which meant that statewide officeholders in Ohio had to appeal to a broader electorate than in other states. This translated well to winning national elections.

* Because Ohio politicians were skilled at building coalitions, they tended to perform well at nominating conventions at a time that candidates were picked at the conventions among the delegates there. Ohioans often came out as a consensus candidate inoffensive to more ideological members of the party. Conventions ""rewarded a candidate with"" skills at ""strong party organization"" which Ohio politicians of the era tended to have.

* Ohio's geographic location helped it as well, with the West being so sparsely populated for most of this era, and elections won by appealing to the electorate East of the Mississippi. Due to intra-migration in the country, Ohioans were good at speaking for the country as a whole, inoffensive to more of the country than most other populated locations, where divisions and rivalries could be more hostile (especially South v. Northeast).

* Ohio had a lot of Civil War military veterans-turned-politicians, who, up until that era, were often candidates (and often successful candidates) for national office.

* Once Ohio was identified as this new cradle of the presidency, Melcher says this created ""momentum"" for future candidates. Ohioans had kept winning the office, so might as well nominate another Ohioan. This argument was being made at the time, for instance, in this [*Western Magazine*](https://books.google.com/books?id=zMAcAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA106&dq=ohio+presidents) article preceding the 1920 election when both major candidates came from Ohio.

In [""Sectionalism and Presidential Politics: Voting Patterns in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/204833?seq=1) by authors Fred M. Shelley and J. Clark Archer, they make several of the same points, though broadening the scope to include Illinois and Indiana, too. Between 1856 and 1920, 8 of 12 men elected President came from one of these three state which ""illustrates the sensitivity"" the Republicans had ""to the importance of mobilizing popular support in these states"". The authors also say these three states had demographic similarities to the South and Northeast that those two sections of the country didn't have to each other: these Midwestern states were rapidly urbanizing with immigrant populations like the Northeast was, but they also had a significant rural population with ties to the South.

In [""U.S. Presidential Elections in the Nineteenth Century: Why Culture and the Economy Both Mattered""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3235469?seq=1) by G. Patrick Lynch, the author also echoes some of what Melcher said. Ohio had elected Democrats to the governorship and their legislature in the 1870s, and Republicans found themselves in a dogfight for political dominance during the period. Indeed, Ohio's shift almost proved fatal: the Republicans won Ohio in 1876 by less than 1.2% of the vote, which, if switched, they would have lost the election (and barely won it anyway, due to the contested Florida vote). The Republicans needed Ohio to secure a Presidential win. 

This agrees with a statistical analysis done by John R. Wright in [""Pivotal States in the Electoral College, 1880 to 2004""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40270742?seq=1), which identified Ohio as one of the most perennially pivotal states to win in elections in that period. Most specifically, Wright identifies Ohio as being the most pivotal state in the 1896 outcome, and the second-most pivotal state in the 1888 election, two elections won in the period by Ohioans. 

This electoral college importance is also offered as the explanation for Ohio's dominance of the era in the 1965 biography *The Available Man: The Life Behind the Masks of Warren G. Harding* by Andrew Sinclair.

In the book [*Ohio and Its People*](https://books.google.com/books?id=-X2j44h3d8IC&pg=PA256) by George W. Knepper, the author echoes Melcher's point about Ohio being the source of compromise among Republicans at the conventions, their politicians often considered safe, and pointing in particular to James A. Garfield's 1880 nomination during a particularly split convention as the best example.

In the book [*The Ohio Presidents: Eight Men and a Binding Political Philosophy in the White House, 1841-1923*](https://books.google.com/books?id=T7VqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4) by Quentin R. Skrabec, Jr., the author makes an argument that echoes Melcher's factor that Ohioans made good compromise candidates. Due to the socioeconomic make-up of the state, Ohioans tended to embody Republican Party and republican (small ""r"") values of the time better than most. On both social issues and economic issues, they followed the Republican Party closely, and Ohio was something of a microcosm of the social conditions of the U.S. as a whole during the period. The state experienced significant growth through immigration, and became more urban, so Ohio politicians had experience appealing to a constituency that was very much like the national electorate. The book also talks about Ohio's [electoral college importance](https://books.google.com/books?id=T7VqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA147&dq=battleground) as a battleground state, and it often acting as a bellwether of the national political mood.


EDIT: Thanks for the silver!"
"My dissertation was on the dynamics of public space in the Roman cities of what is now western Turkey. While conducting research for this project, I spent two summers wandering around dozens of remote Turkish archaeological sites, where I frequently encountered kangals guarding flocks of sheep or goats."
"The Romans invented the letter G to differentiate between the voiceless /k/ and voiced /g/ with the same point of articulation. That's why G is just C with a tail.

Before they did this, in Old Latin, the two sounds were both written with C, CAIUS reflects this archaic spelling, pronunciation stays the same though. ~~I imagine they kept it like this because it was a very old family name and to change it might have taken away from the prestige it had.~~

It obviously would've led to confusion for Classical Latin speakers though, who apparently often mistakenly pronounced it like it was spelled."
"Latin is the name that the Romans themselves used for their language, which was the local Italic language/dialect that was spoken in the region of Latium, a collection of settlements in the lower Tiber valley. It was not the only Italic language; a Roman would have little difficulty conversing with a resident of, say, Tusculum or Lavinium, but would have more difficulty with other branches of Italic, as for instance the Oscan of the Samnites (an example being that the Latin ""quid"" for the interrogative ""what"" is instead rendered in Oscan as ""pid"" -- the relationship is visible but the languages are certainly different). Rome was one of the Latin cities, and became the predominant one (not always peacefully), with a victory over an alliance of Latin cities yielding Rome supremacy over the region from 338 BC. So, in that sense, insisting on calling the language ""Roman"" would be like insisting on calling English ""Londonish,"" although that isn't a particularly fair comparison since the ancient Romans had a concept of the city-state than the medieval English did not.

Interestingly, the term Latin was used by the Romans through the Republic and into the Empire for a sort of partial Roman citizenship; the ""Latin right"" or ""Latin citizenship"" described people and municipalities that possessed some, but not all, of the rights of Roman citizens, and the legal framework was extended to this conferring of partial citizenship to groups that had nothing to do with Latium, as for example a grant of the ius Latii to Spain by the emperor Vespasian, per Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia."

"OK, so, Thor, pretty solid film. Not the best of the MCU, but best of the ""Thor"" subset, IMO. They balanced the light-hearted humor without going overboard. Would recommend! 

Anyways, a few loose ends that bear commenting upon to round out what I cranked out this morning. So having looked a little at the election of 1876, and how it is a little higher than normal, but not too out of line, this leads to another question... Why was 1872 a *very* noticeable anomaly at 71.3%, bounded in 1868 by a turnout of 78.1%, and of course 1876 at 81.8%. 

Let's start in 1868. That year, Grant ran against Horatio Seymour, a northern Democrat from New York, and won with a fairly respectable vote lead. He was especially buoyed by a strong performance in the South, winning many of the former Confederate states. How though? Well, an astute observer might notice that despite a much higher turnout *percentage*, the actual numbers of voters was lower, which would be somewhat counter-intuitive. But, while I have been unable to find any sources which explain *specifically* how that number is calculated, if it is counting eligible voters against turnout, it seems likely that it is accepting the disenfranchisement of many *white* former rebels in the Southern states as legal and proper, and not counting them in the rolls of eligible voters. Certainly, it was the lack of their votes which, unable to balance out the newly enfranchised black vote in the South, helped to support his campaign down there. 

This stands in comparison to the 1872 election, where those former rebels had since been reenfranchised, and thus counted in the rolls of eligible voters. But many voters nevertheless chose to stay home, why? Well, check out who was running! Grant was seeking reelection, but his opponent was Horace Greeley - a Republican, not a Democrat! He was riding the Liberal Republican ticket, a splinter party from the Republicans, dissatisfied with Grant and much of what he had done in his first term. They lacked an entirely cohesive platform but generally stood, at the least, for playing nice with the South, and ending or softening the various Federal policies directed there. Greeley had been one of the most forceful voices in the Republican party for sectional reconciliation, and would win its nomination, but it wasn't straight forward, and caused a good deal of acrimony. At the Party Convention which nominated him, he had gone into is not as the favorite, beating out Charles Francis Adams after six ballots. There was enough bitter disagreements after his victory speech and declaration of platform that Adams supporters mostly just went back to the Grant camp, even if begrudgingly, unwilling to support the ""turncoat and traitor"", representative of the lack of cohesion in the movement from the start.

As for the Democrats... they simply didn't run a candidate. As newspaper editor Theodore Tilton wrote in aptly summing up the sentiment followed:

>Since the Democratic party pledges itself to abide by the constitutional amendments [...] and since it wants universal amnesty [...] why not therefore let the better class of Democrats unite with the anti-Grant Republicans?

But the party was dominated by the Northern Democrats, and perhaps the platform was one they could support, but not necessarily one that made voters in the deep south happy, or at least enough so to nominally vote for a non-Democrat. In the end, it was a fairly tepid election, between two candidates who didn't quite endear themselves well. Grant waltzed to reelection with a 11.80 percent margin on the back of an electorate that perhaps wasn't all in for him, but couldn't get behind Greeley's ""motley"" mix of appeals. What it did represent though was the growing dissatisfaction within *some* parts of the Republican party, who tired of Reconstruction which they were becoming convinced was a failure. It was, of course, a conflict that would underpin the next election, as already noted, but with an actual context between Republicans and Democrats, rather than divisions within the Republican Party alone.

For more on the election of 1872, check out McPherson, James M. ""Grant or Greeley? The Abolitionist Dilemma in the Election of 1872"" *The American Historical Review*, Vol. 71, No. 1 (Oct., 1965), pp. 43-61"
"Yes, the epidemic of [Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_and_murdered_Indigenous_women) (and Indigenous persons in general) is very real. We comment on this in the post, but we tried to keep the historical roots at the center since this is a history subreddit. But part of our jobs as historians is to study the past to see how it informs our contemporary world and it is clear that there is a link between the missing children of this residential/boarding schools and the continued absconding of Indigenous persons."
"This answer to some extent overlaps the nice answer already provided (while I was writing this one), but there's a few additional details here, so I thought I'd provide it anyway.

There are two important pieces of context necessary to understand how the power to ""establish Post Offices and Post Roads"" (called the ""Postal Clause"") landed in the Constitution.

The first thing to understand is that the Articles of Confederation (the interstate compact that preceded the United States Constitution) provided the federal Congress with the power to establish and regulate Post Offices.  So one immediate reason that the Constitution provided a Postal power to the federal Government was that it was already a power being exercised by the federal government going into the Constitutional Convention.  At least some of the founders were not pleased with Postal administration under the Articles, however.  For example, in a letter from John Jay to George Washington in 1789, Jay notes: 

>The Direction of the Post Office, instead of being as hitherto, consigned chiefly to a committee, and managed without much System, should I think be regulated by Law, and put under the Superintendence, and in some Degree under the controul of the Executive. The Public are not well satisfied on this Head, as Matters now stand, and there is but little Reason to expect any important change during the Existence of the present Government. The succeeding one will have an opportunity of doing a very acceptable Service to their Constituents by regulating the Post office in a proper Manner; and the more of such things they may have to do, the better. 

The Articles of Confederation provided only a power relating to Post Offices, but, during the Constitutional Convention, the founders discussed adding several additional related powers to the Constitution, such as adding a power to establish ""post roads,"" a power to ""cut canals"" (proposed by Benjamin Franklin), or a power to ""to grant charters of incorporation where the interest of the U.S. might require the legislative provisions of individual States may be incompetent"" (proposed by James Madison).  Of the debated powers, the only additional power that was actually incorporated into the Constitution, however, was the power to establish ""Post Roads."" More significant changes to the postal organization would have to await the First Congress's enactment of the Act of September 22, 1789 and the Postal Service Act of 1792.  But that's only a very narrow answer to your question.

The second and broader answer is that the founders conceived of the federal government as a government of limited powers.  This scheme is made explicit by the 10th amendment which provides that ""[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""  That is to say, the United States Congress (and the federal government more generally) only has the powers given to it by the Constitution, and no others.  The Constitution contains an extensive list of so-called ""enumerated powers"" for the Congress, which includes the power to establish Post Offices and Post Roads, but also includes, for example, a power to ""regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes"", and to ""coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures.""  You may see a theme here, which is that many of the powers the Constitution provides to Congress relate to areas which necessarily affect the interest of the States collectively and that may not be adequately addressed by states acting individually.

So the ability of the Congress to establish Post Offices and Post Roads can be understood as another way in which the founders sought to provide the nascent federal government with a clearly enumerated ability to regulate and address areas that affected the interests of multiple states, which the delivery of mail unquestionably does.  For example, in the Records of the Federal Convention, during a discussion of whether to add additional powers to the clause, James Madison noted that the primary object of the clause, in his view, was to ""secure an easy communication between the States.""  In short, because the mail, by its nature, must travel between the states, the founders viewed it as a function better regulated by the federal government.

"Forming colonies was never a process with any kind of institutional regularity, practices even within the same country varied widely in their approach and makeup. The differences between Jamestown and the Massachusetts colonies are quite vast, and they were both ostensibly English efforts formed quite closely in chronology. A great deal depended on the particular charter and the particular goal of the sponsors, investors, and colonists. The single unifying element of most colonies was profit. They were expected to produce raw materials, produce mineral wealth, slaves, spices, sugar, or other goods, and they needed both investors to pay the initial costs (who expected a profitable return) as well as laborers to do the bulk of the work. Indigenous workers and indentured servants were the usual choices before the introduction and institutionalization of chattel slavery.

But to answer at least one of your particular questions, there *were* recruitment and advertising campaigns for colonists, quite often. Labor was always in high demand, especially in the first phases of the founding of a colony, as unloading the ships and building a defensible colony on land that would sustain the population was extremely difficult. I've talked in some detail about this in an [old answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cglagv/i_am_leading_a_group_of_europeans_to_found_a_new/eulfdlh/).

Advertising usually focused on the unusual bounty of the new world, making it seem like it was an edenic paradise, with food and splendor freely available to all, so the discomfort of a short term indenture contract would seem like no obstacle at all. Obviously, this was not necessarily reflective of reality, and many colonies either died or went through extremely difficult times.

But the important takeaway is that colonists were seldom *sent*, at least in the first phases of establishment. The people who went to Jamestown or Plymouth were there because they chose to be, either by signing a contract of indenture or by investing in the success of the colony. It wasn't a case of the king or queen selecting a particular set of tradesmen and telling them to board up, it was privately organized with government approval, for the most part. They were businesses more than anything."
"(3 / 3)

It was this recognition that these Old New York roots would be lost if something wasn't done about it, that led to the formation of the New-York Historical Society by John Pintard in 1804, an organization that still exists in the present day. The group was instrumental in promoting St. Nicholas as the patron saint of New York City, based upon the pre-war Dutch celebrations of the saint in New York City. These efforts, in turn, led directly to the development of the modern American association of ""Santa Claus"" with the Christmas holiday - undoubtdly the most widely-known vestige of New York's Dutch past that still survives.

Nevertheless, as already mentioned, the Dutch community went into rapid decline after 1783. The churches were almost universally bilingual by 1810, and were exclusively English by 1835. According to Van der Sijs, in raw numbers, about 100,000 Americans spoke Dutch as their first language in 1790, and perhaps as many as 250,000 Americans could understand it. But this community was rapidly drowned out by a new generation of immigrants, only a tiny fraction of which came from the Netherlands. Between 1790 and 1820, the population of New York state swelled from 340,000 to 1,370,000. By 1840, the state population had almost doubled again, to 2.4 million residents. With new, diverse immigrant communities, English became even more important in this period as a *lingua franca*.

By the 1840s, there was acknowledgement among New Yorkers that their version of the Dutch language was dying off. To preserve and celebrate the old Dutch New York civilization, Washington Irving formed a fraternal organization in 1835 called the St. Nicholas Society. Many of its members, Irving included, did not speak any Dutch, though, and had never really been a part of New York Dutch society. Further, many of its Dutch-speaking members were recent, 19th century Dutch immigrants to New York City, and not part of the community established in the 1600s, who spoke their own unique dialect of the Dutch language. Still, the society's celebrations give a window into the dwindling New York Dutch community in the middle of the 19th century.

From the 1840s on, the newspaper the *Brooklyn Daily Eagle* often reported on the annual celebrations of the St. Nicholas Society, around Easter and St. Nicholas Day. In the early reports, there is often mention of speeches being given in Dutch by some of the members - notably, those given by clergy of the local Dutch churches, as well as by former mayor of Brooklyn Martin Kalbfleisch, and by Teunis G. ""Tune"" Bergen, a one-time U.S. House member representing Brooklyn. Kalbfleisch had been born in the Netherlands and immigrated to New York in 1826, when he was in his twenties, but Bergen was born in Brooklyn in 1806 and was a descendant of the old New York Dutch community. As time went on, these speeches were fewer, and were mostly made by Netherlands natives, not New York natives. The reports would often discuss how, increasingly, only the older members of the Society understood the language. The [1878 report](https://bklyn.newspapers.com/image/50424210/), for example, lamented at how the Dutch language in New York was ""on the wane"".

What's interesting about Bergen is that he gave a speech in the Dutch language almost every year at the St. Nicholas Day feast, until his death in the months after the 1880 celebration. In [the 1877 newspaper article](https://bklyn.newspapers.com/image/50379737/), after Bergen gave his speech, a man named R.S. True gave a toast in Dutch, and then Bergen's son, Teunis Bergen, Jr., (actually Garret T. Bergen) rose to speak. He started by saying that ""he would have to make a translation"" of True's toast to presume to respond to it, though later in the article another member says that he ""did not understand"" why the younger Bergen was not ""willing to give an extemporaneous speech"" in the language. Presumably, this was alluding to the fact that the member thought the younger Bergen's Dutch was good enough, but it shows that there was a disconnect between the Brooklyn-born father (born 1806) and son (born 1833) when it came to their fluency in the New York Dutch. But here's the interesting part: after the elder Bergen's death, it was the son who most often gave the Dutch speech at the annual celebration thereafter, through the 1880s and until his own death in 1893. Despite his Dutch being admittedly not very good, he was one of the last people who was a member of the group who could really speak New York Dutch at all. 

When the younger Bergen's generation died off, the New York Dutch language pretty much died with them. President Theodore Roosevelt (born 1858) would give a good example in [his 1913 autobiography](https://books.google.com/books?id=0D8OAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=dutch). In it, he says of his grandfather (Cornelius Roosevelt, born 1794, died 1871): ""When he was young, he still spoke some Dutch"" and the church services were still in Dutch when his grandfather was ""a small boy"", but Roosevelt himself was only ever taught a few words, in a ""baby song"" his grandmother would sing to him in his youth. He never knew more Dutch than that, nor had his father Theodore Sr. (born 1831), despite them coming from a Dutch family that stretched back to the mid-1600s.

Between 1910 and 1913, Columbia University language professor John Dyneley Prince (who would later serve terms as the U.S. ambassador to Denmark, and then to Yugoslavia) wrote three articles in *Dialect Notes* about the dying ""Jersey Dutch"" language. These included a brief vocabulary and some scraps of texts. In the first article ([""The Jersey Dutch Dialect""](https://books.google.com/books?id=z7EmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA4590)), he claimed that the language only survived at that time among about two hundred speakers in northern New Jersey, almost all of them seventy years old or older. This, he wrote, despite that as recently as thirty years earlier, it had been spoken by many thousands. He claimed that he'd been told there was also a community in Suffern, New York, who could still speak ""Negro Dutch"", but due to their ""shyness of strangers"", he made no effort to contact them at that time, nor did anyone else attempt to preserve their language in any meaningful way.

Thus, the last of the New York Dutch speakers, concludes Van der Sijs, must have died off in the next few decades after 1910. A doctor named Lawrence Van Loon would make claims beginning in the 1930s that he was conversant in the language, learned from his grandfather, and he would continue to write articles and make these claims up until his death in 1985. However, it was later determined he was a fraud: he did have New York Dutch ancestry, but he had learned Holland Dutch through school, during a medical residency in Amsterdam, where he met and married a Dutch woman, who he brought back to the United States. He then incorporated Prince's vocabulary and some other brief, preserved vocabularies from other sources, and presented himself as though he had been taught the New York Dutch dialect firsthand. The last person who may *actually* have been in any way conversant in the language at all, directly from native speakers, was probably James Storms, who was born in 1860 and died in 1949. Before his death, he had written out a vocabulary list, which was published posthumously in 1964, and it is considered authentic. He prefaced it by saying he was ""about the last surviving person in my section"" of the country that spoke Jersey Dutch. As it turns out, he probably was *the* last, as nobody is known to have survived after that.

In 1965, historian Van Cleaf Bachman wrote an article in the Holland Society's *De Halve Maen* periodical, asking for submissions from readers with any New York Dutch vocabulary they might know. Despite Lawrence Van Loon's response that he could speak it, everything else Bachman received in return amounted to a few phrases remembered by people who, when young, had heard older relatives speak the language. Nobody could speak the language themselves. By then, the language was certainly dead, and had probably died for good with the death of James Storms in 1949, or at most, shortly thereafter.

One last note: as Van der Sijs's book details, there was actually a second Dutch-American community, established mainly in Michigan and Iowa in the 1840s. This community also established a multi-generational culture, with native-born Americans able to converse in the language. But it didn't last nearly as long, and not long enough to quite establish the broad vocabulary and dialect changes of New York and Jersey Dutch. The grandchildren of the original mid-19th Century immigrants were typically the last in this Midwestern Dutch community able to speak the language. It, too, had died off as a living language by World War II, if not sooner."

"> However, public sentiments still sided with many reports and editorials that said the loss of life could have been avoided if only the law enforcement agencies employed different tactics.

I was looking at some opinion polls, and according to [this CBS article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-govt-covered-up-waco/):

* In 1993, in the aftermath of the siege, **70%** of Americans supported the government's actions
* In 1999, that had dropped to **38%**

This doesn't seem like ""public sentiments"" at the time criticizing the government...?

Two 1995 CNN/Time survey give some more insight:

* April 1995, 66% of people say it was not the government's deliberate fault
* July 1995, 49% of people say they think the government is **covering something up** (ETA: 39% don't think there's a coverup; 12% unsure/no response)

That seems like a different story/type of mistrust in the government?

"Can I ask a follow-on? I believe that Genghis Khan (and possibly Attila?) followed the practice of treating cities well if they surrendered before battle, but putting them, any civilians to the sword if they resisted. This lead to mass casualties amongst civiloans I believe.  Did Alexander do a similar thing in his conquests? Did his sacking of cities etc have comparable brutality? I guess in a nutshell - are we comparing apples and apples in terms of method and brutality?"
"During the United States' westward colonization in the 19th century, one of the most cohesive groups to take advantage of the overland trails was the Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints), on account of persecution and violence back east. While some did go all the way to California, most overlanding Mormons settled in Utah. Pitching out in Utah Territory ought to have been a refuge/semi-independent existence for the Mormons, but then the 1849+ gold rush happened. And Utah became a necessary transit point for the flood of emigrants to California. Well, transit point and conflict zone.

Because while some emigrants found that Mormons were good to trade with, attitudes often soured very quickly in both directions. Lacking roads, wagon trains and cattle herds rumbled through whatever fields and towns stood in their way, often tearing up the seasons' crops. Mormons who remembered themselves or their ancestors being assaulted and having their property destroyed back in the Midwest, in return, saw their chance to harass emigrants under the excuse that surely they had come from Missouri, Illinois, etc. It's important to remember we are talking about settled, established colonies/territories here. When violent (to people or property) incidents happened, parties went to court--and smashed right into a harshly divided Utah administration split between local, often ecclesiastically-appointed Mormon officials and federal administrators dispatched from Washington.

Basically, *no one* was happy. Emigrants felt they could not get justice from Mormon juries. Mormon officials believed federal delegates were overriding their sovereignty and territory rights. U.S.-sent officials complained that the LDS Church could and did essentially override their own decisions.

And in the 1850s, this concept of popular sovereignty had a peculiar importance in American politics that you might be more familiar with under the phrase ""states' rights""--that is, it needed to serve as a code word, in the politics of President James Buchanan's Democratic party, for the defense of *slavery*. Mormon theological opinions--namely, polygamy--couldn't be allowed to tarnish the image of a seen-as-necessary principle. 

With the complaints from Good Protestant Overlanders and fleeing federal officials combined with darkening attitudes towards Mormons and Mormonism as politically damaging, Buchanan by fiat declared a new (non-Brigham Young) governor of Utah and sent a cadre of troops as combination police officers/bodyguards in 1857. Young and the Mormon leadership either did not get this memo or had reasonable experience on which to believe this memo was a purposeful deception: they saw the incoming troops as an invasion force meant to impose martial law and renew persecution of Mormons. So they called up *their* own militia, prepared for doomsday scenarios, and *forbid Mormon residents from dealing with or aiding non-Mormon overlanders.*

As to why the Utah Expedition/Utah War is less often discussed, of course there are the general platitudes like ""you can only study so much in one history class"" ""not enough people were killed to make it a significant war"" ""the U.S. soldiers were kind of wimpy and when the '57-58 winter was bad they kinda just gave up and went home."" But to investigate more specifically to the historical context, I'd like to focus on one brutal event within the time frame of the Utah War: the Mountain Meadows Massacre.

Like other emigrant groups before them, the Baker-Fancher wagon train (named for its leader-organizers, John Baker and Alexander Fancher) out of Arkansas had counted on being able to wheel and deal with Mormon shopkeepers for supplies before they headed through mountains and desert. Not under the new apocalypse-coming statues of the LDS community, though. Frustrated, the Fancher party did two things. First, they stopped to camp at Mountain Meadows pass in southern Utah to rest and consolidate for the weary trip ahead in the face of fewer supplies than they had planned for. Second, they talked a massively violent rhetorical game against the Mormons. *Not only* were they going to give the Mormons trouble, *not only* were the incoming U.S. army troops going to give the Mormons even more trouble, *but*--the clincher--people in the Fancher party ""knew people"" who had oppressed the Mormons right out of Missouri, or maybe--some bragged--maybe they had *been* those people.

Local militia leaders Isaac Haight and John Lee were not about to let this slide. They determined to attack the wagon train while they were camped. They were evil-crafty about it, too--they paid a group of Paiute Indians in cattle to participate in the initial attack in September 1857. 

But Lee in particular wasn't satisfied with a few deaths in a skirmish. With the terrified Fanchers huddled down where they could defend themselves but not actually escape (and the threat of winter--and not being able to pass the mountains--looming), he went in to negotiate their surrender. Children and the wounded would leave first, in wagons; women and older children next; finally the men would walk out.

But Lee didn't mean ""surrender,"" he meant ""lambs to the slaughter."" The Mormon soldiers massacred the entire wagon train. Only a handful of very young children were allowed to survive (they were kidnapped/adopted by Mormon families). 

Historians have called this the worst event in Mormon history, which you might expect from historians. But the Mormons knew it at the time, too. Heck, they knew it in advance, which is why Lee and Haight worked so hard to get the Paiutes to participate in the initial attack. And while white Mormons were responsible for the brutal massacre, Paiute participation gave them the opening to claim Indian responsibility for ""yet another"" wagon train attack. (As John Unruh demonstrated so categorically, the actual ""Indian threat"" to overlanders was borderline nil, and our stereotypes today are the result of pop culture tropes and rumors already current in the 1840s).

The interesting thing, though, is that blaming the Paiutes didn't work quite as neatly as Haight and especially Lee might have hoped. So the Mormon leadership, desperate to avoid being implicated in triggering the slaughter, turned Mountain Meadows into a pinpoint-local event instead. They offered up Lee as the scapegoat--he was excommunicated in 1870 and *executed* in 1877. Well, America's gossip mill loves a good gory bad guy making a bad end, which quieted things on the ""back east"" and government ends. And it's not like the Utah government was raring to make ""the worst event in Mormon history"" a topic of major discussion.

Nicely illustrative of how the Massacre slid out of historical memory is the fate of its physical commemoration through memorials and historic markers. In 1859, with the massacre still a fresh memory *and* knowledge of white domination of its perpetration bleedingly fresh, U.S. military officials (!) set up a massive monument at Mountain Meadows. Brigham Young himself apparently oversaw its destruction just months later. The U.S. rebuilt it; the Mormons destroyed it again.

In 1932, with Utah now a nice state and the LDS Church itself not directly involved in government in the same way as the territory days, the state historic commission determined to build a marker. Except...they basically hid it behind rocks several miles from the road, so no one would *actually* see it. To make things even worse: Juanita Brooks' 1950 book *The Mountain Meadows Massacre*, the first scholarly investigation of the event which laid much of the blame at the feet of Young and the LDS hierarchy, triggered two reactions. First, quietly, the LDS church undid Lee's excommunication very posthumously, recognizing that the extent to which he had been scapegoated was wrong. Second, also quietly, the church *bought the land where the 1932 marker was*--and razed it.

And as James Loewen discovered in his investigations for *Lies Across America*, as late as 1990, the ""new, improved"" marker firmly in U.S. government control still stated:

* ""The company of emigrants...*was attacked*"" [passive voice]
* the original monument ""was not maintained"" [interesting way to say *torn down*]

The Mountain Meadows Massacre is not a feel-good story on anyone's part. The emigrants--who are undeniably teh victims here!--have been built up in collective memory to look not so good (victim blaming is always the easy way out), the Mormons don't look good, the U.S. government doesn't even look all that good for giving the impression of invading a territory (bad PR, overwrought officials fleeing and stoking rumours/hatred in Washington, giving up after one blizzard). The massacre didn't fit pre-Unruh theories about horrible violent Indians; but the real story of Indian participation in the beginning plus being blamed for the later events doesn't particularly suit *any* political agendas in more recent decades. The Utah Expedition roots that helped spark the slaughter are a diversion from the ""popular sovereignty is about slavery"" narrative that drives what you might call the major plot line of U.S. political history leading up to the Civil War.

Historical memory is not inevitable: people control what does and doesn't get told, as well as how it gets told. With so much history out there, far more than anyone could ever hope to know--yes, agendas are going to drive what does and does get ""told"" and ""remembered"". And as the history of the Mountain Meadows Massacre's commemoration shows, in this case people on all sides had a much more vested interest in forgetting than remembering."

"I’ve done a lot of research on this (the Inca) but I’m unfortunately not at home so I can’t pull any of books out at the moment, but when I get home I may find them in a box and be better able to source these answers and double check my memory.

One reason is that the last (free) Incan emperor fled east into the Amazon jungle because of how effective Spanish cavalry was when augmented with infantry. The distinction of free Inca is important - for a considerable period, the Spanish tried to maintain the illusion of puppet/vassal emperors, the first of which was Tupac Huallpa. In fact, the point of the greatest resistance to the Spanish happened during the reign of the second such puppet emperor, Manco Inca, after his terrible mistreatment by the Spanish.

The advantage of metal weapons and armor in the Spanish cuirrasiers as well as firearms is often cited in the Spanish conquest of the Americas, but in Peru, where Pizzarro had an order of magnitude fewer conquistadors than Cortez - I think Cortez had \~2500 or 5000 and Pizzaro had around 500, of which almost 100 were cavalry? Again no primary sources to double check but I will edit when I return home if the numbers are wrong, but regardless there was a serious  disparity in the two Spaniard’s size and army composition. In Peru, cavalry rather than metal per se was the decisive factor. After a few engagements it seems the Inca realized that their overwhelming numbers would eventually win out against Spanish infantry *if they could piecemeal attack the very thinly spread Spaniards*, but not against cavalry in the plains, so they began ambushing small columns from cliffsides and across rivers. This did result in a handful of minor victories in which fewer than a dozen Spaniards were killed in total, which were immense morale victories, but more often than not Spaniards were able to withdraw in good order to eventually reform in terrain they knew they could win.

It also isn’t part of the general western imagining of the conquests, but it cannot be understated that both Pizarro and Cortez were very reliant on the thousands of native allies they had to supply them but also act as the anvil to their hammer, as native infantry secured their flanks from imperial Incan armies during their major engagements. The story of how these natives became allies is itself fascinating but outside the scope of this question. The siege of Cuzco, the major event of Manco’s resistance/rebellion, lasted as long as it did because even though there was a sizable Spanish infantry garrison, they had split and sent most of their force, including the ultra-important cavalry, elsewhere, and what cavalry remained didn’t have sufficient support from native infantry to protect itself and break the siege on their own for a great while.

The Inca tried several resolutions to Spanish technology, the aforementioned ambushes, but the only time there was a serious and significant challenge to Spanish authority after Atahualpa actually involved feats of engineering, which the Inca were masters of, from their [exceptional road system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_road_system) to [cyclopean, monolithic fortresses like Ollantaytambo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollantaytambo). During the last large scale battle (which I can recall without primary sources), Ollantaytambo, the Inca rerouted nearby irrigation canals to flood the battlefield, hoping to force the Spanish to dismount. The Spanish weren’t willing to assault without their cavalry advantage, but the Inca weren’t or couldn’t press the advantage either (I can’t recall why, again no sources in front of me), and shortly after the majority of the Spanish forces returned. With that, Manco knew the one ace he had the Spanish army didn't, Incan engineering, had been played, in likely the only place where he would have time, resources, and most importantly opportunity to attempt it, and was forced to flee.

His choice of retreat was excellent as the jungle and mountain highlands prevented Spanish cavalry from maneuver and the visibility greatly reduced the utility of Spanish guns, which did not completely but did go a great way toward leveling the field of combat, as the post-Cuzco empire, sometimes call the neo-Inca empire, held out for decades in the Amazonian jungle, aided by a combination of disease, secrecy, and the lack of cavalry. However, Manco was never able to command large infantry forces, most nobles having been swayed by Spanish victory after Ollantaytambo, and the Spanish were able to scout and pursue using primarily native forces with Spanish officers.

Let me take a moment and say that it is actually contentious whether or not the Inca royalty did or did not retreat to Machu Picchu at some point and whether or not the Spanish did or did not go to Machu Picchu independent of that during the manhunt for Manco post Ollantaytambo. There are some historians (a minority, but a legitimate and credible one, not some crazy ancient-aliens minority as seems to sometimes unfortunately gravitate to Incan history) who believe that there is evidence Manco Inca did briefly hide at Machu Picchu in the interim period between fleeing Ollantaytambo and the failed siege of Cuzco and arriving at Vilcabamba, the palace within the Amazon. The Spanish were hesitant to explore the mountains and jungles where they knew their cavalry were ineffective *and* the Inca could arrange ambushes, but Machu Picchu’s only real defense was its secrecy. It is too small to house a large garrison and even a small garrison would have been problematic - while the palace had gardens for supporting the servants, from what I recall the palace was primarily supported by nearby villages and could not have self-sustained, and that support would have ended during a siege, at which point the Spanish and their Incan allies would have vastly outnumbered the garrison. If he had retreated to Machu Picchu, and as I said there is contention whether he did or did not briefly, word of Spanish aligned scouts may have pushed him from Machu Picchu to Vilcabamba A. so as not to be trapped and B. for the aforementioned benefits of the jungle in countering one of the most important Spanish advantage, although by that point Spanish reinforcements from Mexico were arriving and different native noble groups had been granted elevated positions of power/bribed so as to supplant those who had held power in the Incan hierarchy, and by the time of Vilcabamba any hope of a serious resistance was functionally over.

It's of course difficult to find books on Columbus and other explorers that avoid a lot of the modern controversies surrounding him, but Fernand Braudel's classic *The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World* gives a fairly sophisticated look at the interconnected cultures of trade, politics, and intellectual exchange that the discoveries of the 1490s interrupted. It's not without its problems, but it's a class for a reason.

For a closer look at Columbus's own ideas of his accomplishments, there are many publications that cover them in more or less detail. [Quite a few have been digitized.](https://archive.org/details/writingsofchrist00colu).

"How do we know what people in the ancient world believed?

We read their literature, as well as we know how, and so far as it still exists. We excavate their cities and sanctuaries, and interpret them as carefully as we can. And then we try to shore the literary fragments against the ruins, and extrapolate a world. Can we know what individuals thought? Unless they were kind enough to write it down for us (and their jottings survived), no. But to the extent that the literature and the archaeological remains seem to agree, and to the extent that our cross-cultural models allow us to understand them, we can usually form a picture, however hazy, of practice and belief in an ancient society. 

As devoted readers of this sub, you know all this already. I just felt like pontificating. For a little more substance, let's turn, all too briefly, to the Greeks and Romans. 

Two blanket statements. First, virtually all Greeks and Romans believed in their gods. Second, belief in the gods did not necessarily translate to a literal understanding of the traditional myths about those gods. 

Greek religion and Roman religion - to use conventional shorthands for what were actually loose families of affiliated but distinctive local practices - were focused on practice, rather than belief. The gods, in other words, were assumed to be much more interested in what their worshipers did for them than in what their worshipers thought them. This meant, in effect, that the act of sacrifice was the ultimate statement of belief: gratifying the gods with burnt offerings (or libations, etc.) was at once a prudent insurance policy and an effective profession of faith. It might be tempting to imagine (by analogy with modern religious holidays) that traditional religious festivals in the classical world eventually became more or less formalities - a chance for everybody to kick back, watch a little drama, and enjoy a bit of barbecued ox. For some Greeks and Romans, they may well have become so. But the mere fact that sacrifices continued regularly, century after century, in so many ancient cities suggests that the great majority took them quite seriously: the gods were real, and had to be placated. To this can be added the vast body of evidence for personal devotion to the gods - family altars, ex voto offerings, dedications at shrines, etc., etc. And to that we may add the testimonials provided by our  literary sources, which establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that the great majority of Greeks and Romans assumed that the gods were very real. 

None of this means, of course, that they took the myths seriously. As early as the sixth century BC, Greek philosophers and public intellectuals began to criticize the myths. Some of the more radical thinkers of the Classical period theorized that the myths were actually dimly-remembered episodes from ancient history, and that the gods had originally been human kings and inventors. Others speculated that the gods and the myths had been deliberately invented in the distant past as a means of political control. Similar strands of criticism are visible in Stoic philosophy (which treated the myths as allegories), in Epicurean philosophy (which treated the myths as dangerous fables), and in the general intellectual milieu of the Roman imperial era (see, for example, the splendid satires of Lucian). It seems clear that most educated Greeks and Romans really did regard the myths as a matter of cultural literacy, not literal truth. But their disdain for the myths was motivated largely by a desire to disassociate them from the gods, in whom most of them still believed. The myths, it was thought, were unworthy of the gods, and the gods undeserving of the myths foisted upon them by tradition. 

I could cite various passages from ancient authors in support of all this; but frankly, I'm tired. The point, in any case, needs no belaboring. In certain contexts, many Greeks and Romans were perfectly comfortable mocking the gods of myth - take Dionysus in Aristophanes' Frogs, or Zeus in any of Lucian's dialogues. There were even ""theme parks"" of a sort, in the case of Ilium, a major tourist destination on what was thought to be the site of Homer's Troy ([more on such tourism here](https://toldinstone.com/where-did-the-greeks-and-romans-go-on-vacation/)). But for most Greeks and Romans (with the exception of those wretched atheistic Epicureans), the gods were real. Take the emperor Julian's heartfelt (if tedious) hymn to Cybele, or Apuleius' paean to Isis, or Aelius Aristides' praises of Ascelpius, or even - at the beginning of classical literature - Odysseus' relationship with Athena. The Greeks and Romans didn't always take their gods seriously. But they never - quite - reduced them to cartoon characters."

##Warfare

It is a common misconception many in the West hold today that Indigenous Nations of the past were *always* in constant warfare with one another, murdering or even ""genociding"" one group after the next to secure their resources. The reality is that this is grossly inaccurate, at least from what Indigenous Peoples themselves say, from the reality of the Indigenous World. Two examples come to mind to demonstrate this.

[The first is about counting coup.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/56f7vz/did_native_americans_really_count_coup_on_their/d8jteua/) Many Tribes centered around warrior societies and warfare. Yet, as Richard Gilmore describes, the act of conducting war and killing enemies was structured by ceremony.

>[Lear says, ""The Crow were a nomadic, hunting, warrior tribe....Their ancestors, the Hidatsa, had lived along the Mississippi River at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and had migrated during that century to North Dakota."" Later, they moved on to Montana.  Crow culture was nomadic and oriented around warfare. Everything they did, and all members of the tribe participated in the ongoing preparations, celebrations, lamentations associated with war activities. The coup stick was central to their whole way of life. The coup stick had two primary roles. One was to mark the (temporary) boundary of the tribe. A coup stick would be planted in the ground, and where it was planted became an impassable barrier to any non-Crow, which every Crow warrior would defend to the death. The other role for the coup stick was that a warrior would have to strike an enemy with his coup stick before any other harm could be done to him. Lear describes this activity of counting coup in terms of a “symbolic excess.” Before harming an enemy, you must touch him without harming him. This is not about utility; this is about identity. It is about Crow courage, Crow honor, and what it means to be a Crow warrior.](http://northernplainsethicsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/richardgilmore.pdf)

Yet again, it is demonstrated that actions are highly tied to a group's culture. Many like to disassociate a particular group's rationale and view when it comes to looking upon those of the past. [This disassociation often leads to a projection of the researcher's own cultural values and biases onto what they're researching.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6a09j9/monday_methods_is_research_valueneutral/) This has led many to assume that warfare between Tribes was conducted in the same way that Europeans conducted war and how war is conducted today. There were no massive battles on the scale of continental invasions between Indigenous Nations. Their lifestyles did not support such ways and doing so would result in irreparable damage to their groups. As mentioned earlier, they were constrained practically by their resources and culturally, it was not the norm to tolerate what amount to acts of genocide (Akwesasne Notes, 2005, p. 36; p. 106)

Furthermore, it is incredibly understated by those of the West the role that Euro-Americans themselves played when it came to conflict between Indigenous Peoples. Reports of wars taken by colonizers neglect to examine the reasons behind many conflicts and insert their assumptions into the mix.

>In pre-Columbian times, the peoples of North America to varying degrees engaged in some level of internation warfare. FOr many tribes, the frequency and intensity of military conflict was greatly increased by the arrival of Europeans. This increase esulted directly from conflict with the invading and expanding European and European American population and indirectly from intertribal conflicts created by the European incursion that pushed Indian nations from their own lands onto the lands of other nations. Changes brought about by the European introduction of such things as new weapons and the horse also had an impact. This set of developments increased the importance of the role of the warrior and of warrior ways of thinking and acting for some Indigenous people (Sachs, Harris, Morris, & Hunt, 2011, p. 91).

>For example, in the 1740s an d 1750s, Comanche bands, armed with guns provided by French traders farther east, pushed increasingly west into what is now New Mexico, putting them into increasing conflict with Apache bands. As Apaches moved westward as a result of this pressure, they increasingly raided Pueblos (and Spanish settlements) in the Rio Abajo. Similarly, as part of the long chain of displacements beginning with European movement into the Eat Coast of North America, by 1850, a century of migration caused the movement of the better-armed (thanks to European and American traders) Chippewa to their east (and encouraged with the arrival of the horse by the lure of huge buffalo herds) found the Lakotas moving out onto the Great Plans and clashing with the Crow, who in turn undertook a fighting retreat westward. The increase in warfare resulting from the pressue of migration and technological change ... in turn affected Lakota society and culture, increasing the role and value of the warrior (p. 103, fn. 85).

The second example comes from the Mesoamerican Cultures. Stannard (1992) elaborates on this for us:

>Rather than meeting resistance when he approaches the great city, Cortes was greeted in friendship and was welcomed by Montezuma. In retrospect this behavior of the Aztec leader has usually seemed foolish or cowardly or naive to Western historians. But Mesoamerican political tradtions had always dictated that war was to be announced before it was launched, and the reasons for war were always made clear well beforehand. War was a sacred endeavor, and it was sacrilegious to engage in it with treachery or fraud (p. 76). . .

>. . .anthropologist Stanley Diamond has noted that to people such as the American Indians ""taking a life was an *occasion,*"" whereas warfare of the type described ""is a kind of play. No matter what the occasion for hostility, it is particularized, personalized, ritualized."" In contrast, by the time of the invasion of the Americas, European warfare had long since been made over into what Diamond describes as ""an abstract, ideological compulsion"" resulting in ""indiscriminate, casual, unceremonious killing"" (p. 111).

What we see here is that warfare in general was not conducted the same way the Europeans conducted war. The visualizations held by many today really are a result of a cultural spin being put onto a marginalized group. Different cultures have different ways and perspectives on the same matters and this distinguishing is important because it helps us to more accurately understand the past and our present. Wanton killing and total war *were not* the norm for Indigenous Peoples, though there are always exceptions to the rules. This is a result, again, of both practicality and Culture being merged. One informs the other and ignoring this blinds us to seeing the reality others bear.

"There are certainly inaccuracies, particularly in older films where less care was taken over such matters. 

But the main thing about modern films is they give a very particular image of a Roman Legionary that isn't necessarily entirely wrong but kind of suggests a greater degree of uniformity between individual soldiers and across space and time that didn't exist so much. 

When i say legionary what do you think of? Probably a very rectangular shield, locrica segmentum armour (that's the armour made of stips of metal) and a red tunic. All of these things are entirely plausible but not necessarily uniformly the case. 

Shield shapes vary a fair bit between very rectangular in their profile, if curved back and rectangular. That design was probably most common in the peak of the imperial period, the 1st and 2nd century AD. But in much of the republican era it was more of an oval, over time it gets a little smaller and more rectangular as we move towards the imperial period and then later it transitions again so that ovals are becoming more common again towards the 3rd century. 

For the armour again that locrica segmentum was primarily a peak imperial period design and even in that peak it was very much mixed in with mail armour. It would have been much less common both before and after that period and probably was still less common than mail even during it peak of use. 

Now for red tunics, there is some archeologically evidence to back up the use of red tunics. And it makes sense, red was associated with Mars and war and madder was a common and relatively inexpensive red dye in the Mediterranean area. But firstly there has also been archeologically evidence for the use of simply undyed material. Madder can be used to produce a variety of red colours but generally its probably easier to get out of it various more orange, brick or fiery shades that a really bright scarlet you often see if in films. Given the colour of mars the planet i have also sometimes wondered what shade of red it was exactly that mars the deity was associated with. Plus you have to consider that these dyes would have lost some vibrancy over time with washing and the sun. 


Higher ranking officers might have worn a brighter red, Caesar is sometimes mentioned as wearing red to distinguish him from his men. There's also the fact that as i said madder is a Mediterranean plant. Rome's extensive trade networks meant that while you'd probably see red tunics in some numbers everywhere you'd probably get a lot less away from the centre of the Roman world, up on the Danube, Rhine and British frontiers perhaps you'd see less, particularly if you were stationed away from centres of the region. And there might well have been a smattering of other colours, some might have been able to afford to properly bleach their tunics white, some might have worn a blue, some maybe a mustard yellow. 

Its also worth mentioning late imperial soldiers seem to rarely get any time in the sun in films and they'd have some slightly different equipment like a longer spatha sword, spears"
"I don’t see that there’s any other answer than ‘it depends’. More particularly, it depends on why your teacher has decided to frame the Second World War in this way.

I’m coming at this from a perspective of someone who studies (and teaches) a conflict whose relationship to the Second World War is quite debatable. A classic exam-style question for college students who study modern European history is ‘Was the Spanish Civil War the opening phase of the Second World War?’. It’s asked not because there is a right or wrong answer, but because it depends entirely on how you define the crucial issues at stake, and you can make a valid argument either way. For instance, if the Second World War is defined as an anti-fascist war, then it makes sense to view Spain as the beginning of this wider conflict; the opening blows in a wider ideological war. But if the Second World War is about something else – not least because the war in Asia and the Pacific doesn’t map neatly into a fascist/anti-fascist divide – then it no longer makes sense to view Spain as part of the same conflict. Your exam answer depends entirely on the frame of reference you want to adopt.

In this case, I can think of several reasons why someone might want to frame the conflict in the ways that your teacher wanted to. For instance, in terms of simple arithmetic, these are the theatres that saw the highest numbers of deaths. For both Germany and Japan, I believe there’s a case to be made that these were considered the most important fronts to achieve their aims, and generally saw the largest allocation of resources, though I’d gladly defer to an expert on either war effort on the extent this held true over time. Equally, there are reasons why it’s spurious – the influence of the United States, especially in terms of industrial production, was far too large to entirely discount in this way. The territory and populations that were won and lost in the ‘comparatively small’ conflicts were massive by any reasonable standard, and those that suffered occupation, displacement, exploitation and extermination could justifiably challenge any version of the conflict that so blithely downplayed their experiences.

But more importantly, I think, there’s a pedagogical case to be made for radically reframing the conflict for students. I don’t think any conflict has been the subject of national myth-making to the extent that the Second World War has, from the Battle of Britain, to Omaha Beach, to the French Resistance and more. There is a tendency to emphasise certain national perspectives, which in turn often leads to distorted impressions of how the war was won or lost. Challenging students’ understanding of what was important about the Second World War, going beyond the frame of reference that is provided in popular culture and high school history, is a useful way of showing students that things can look very different from perspectives other than the ones we grew up with. In other words, showing that studying history is not just about memorising dates and events, but being critical and flexible in how we approach the past.

Tl;dr: if your professor has presented this view as divine truth, then there are many reasons to question it. But if, as seems more likely, they are challenging you to rethink the way you’ve framed the Second World War up until now, then they're just doing their job."

"I need to preface this to point out you're asking for a fairly tall order. *Gunsmoke* was set in the 1870s. *Bonanza* was set in the 1860s. Someone watching the show in the 1960s potentially could have been alive then, but we're also looking at someone who, at best, was a small child. At the most charitable, when *Gunsmoke* debuted on the radio in 1952, an 80 year old who lived in Dodge City would have been *born* the year of its founding in 1872. While I can't discount the possibility of a 105 year old who left a memoir about his thoughts on *Gunsmoke*, with an extensive library on the topic of the Western and American culture, I can unfortunately tell you that it is quite few and far between. As such, I'm approaching this question a bit more conceptually, first focusing on the mythos of the American West in media before then going into reactions to that media by people in the West. I can promise you that we will look at responses by people who lived through it, but the focus, by necessity, will be a few years earlier, and I promise we will look at the '50s/'60s, but likewise the focus these, by necessity, will be more institutional. We'll even have one old-timer who is involved in that *institutional* response, but sadly I don't believe we know how many thumbs up he gave *Calamity Jane*. So... with that all noted...

The American West is a heavily mythologized space. Even before the frontier was officially declared ""closed"" in 1890, which is considered by some to be the bookend to the era, pop culture representations of the ""Wild West"" were being consumed by audiences of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. By the turn of the century, this was supplemented by the flood of dime novels, and soon too, the emerging art of cinema, with one of the very first films ever shot, *The Great Train Robbery*, being of the Western genre. 

While none of this is to say that violence was *never* present in the American West, this media representation almost always catered a distorted image of an untamed wilderness filled with gunfighters and bank robbers, cowboys and Indians, and the occasional heroic lawman, but few and far between, and thus interpersonal violence often unchecked. I've expanded on the overrepresentation of interpersonal violence before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a0fg7a/after_playing_a_ton_of_red_dead_redemption_i/eai9p86/), so I won't spend too much time on it again, but will emphasize a few caveats. The big one of course is that famous incidents of violence were very real! The Shootout at the OK Corral *happened*. The James-Younger Gang ran rampant. Wild Bill did shoot down David Tutt and was himself later murdered. But the popular memory often can miss some of the underlying details - for instance, [see here for Jesse James](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/b10n87/red_dead_redemption_2_takes_place_in_1899_and_has/eiio7u5/) - and in any case paints a picture of this violence being endemic, when in fact it was fairly rare. We remember those names for a reason. Not because they were one of thousands of shootouts which just happen to stand out, but rather they stand out because they were exceptional instances of violence and not the norm. There are surely some Westerns out there with more violent deaths in a single film than the West experienced as a whole in that period.

In this light, your average homesteader would likely never see a shootout at high noon, of which a mere handful ever happened at all. You'd be hard-pressed to find the survivor of a wagon train who had to circle up to fight off the attacking Native Americans only to be saved by the cavalry at the last minute, because that is mainly just a Hollywood trope. Violence *was* real though, to be sure, but the focus here is interpersonal. The common strains of violence in the West were between the US government and the indigenous peoples whose land was being encroached upon, and as such attempted to resist against genocide. A number of conflicts there, are of course, well known. 

Likewise one of the closest things *to* reality might be the representation of the range war on screen, which while gussied up for the cinema, did reflect real conflict which erupted a number of times in the West, but conflict tied to land rights and water access for the booming cattle industry rather than random interpersonal violence. Quite a few films portray these conflicts with various degrees of creative liberty - *Heaven's Gate* and the Johnson County War for instance, and just about any film with Billy the Kid makes him into an anti-hero of the Lincoln County War - but even then we need to see these as a deviation from the norm, and not reflective of the day to day experience of most.

Now I promise we're getting somewhere with all this. Bear with me. The broad, overarching point of all of this comes back to the opening line about the American West being mythical. This materializes itself on multiple fronts. The first is generally how a very false image of the West contributed, and continues to, concepts of American individualism and feeds an image of historic rugged independence. The second, and more central to our purposes is that much of that myth continues to be rewritten, and media representations of the West often say much more about the time they were done in than the West itself. Those two ideas of course can be very intertwined, but what this all is to say is that the Western as a genre has rarely been an authentic, or accurate, reflection of life in the American West, but it instead has reflected how Americans use the *idea* of the West as part of their national myth.

So focusing on the period you ask about, with shows like *Gunsmoke*, *The Lone Ranger*, and *Bonanza*, or movies like *High Noon* or *Rio Bravo* (the rise of the Italian-made Spaghetti Western in the '60s is a [whole other deal](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6czwld/western_movies_from_then_60s_and_70s_typically/dhz8vxf/)), all of these, in their own ways, draw on tropes about the American West, filtered through the lens of Cold War American culture. Some of it reflects reality, some of it doesn't. Much of it might be taking a sliver of truth and inflating it and distorting it. And in all cases they are engaging with the Western mythos more than the honest truth. An important thing to keep in mind here, as well, is that participants in the *real* events often were the biggest boosters of telling the myth. While generally a generation earlier, a number of the central figures in the epic retelling of the West, such as Wyatt Earp and ""Bat"" Masterson lived into the 1920s. William S. Hart, an actor and director of a number of Westerns during the 1910s and 1920s, befriended both of them and used those conversations he had to try and inform his idea of what an 'authentic' Western would be, nor was he the only one to benefit from the input of such figures.

This, perhaps, is the meatiest response to your direct question as we're looking at the period where the *participants* were alive, and when it comes to them, they were often quite happy with how the portrayals went. They, after all, were not only the subjects of these legends, but also some of their biggest boosters. They weren't just the ones who had *been* the gunfighter or *been* the lawman, but they were the ones who helped to contribute to making those the dominant images of the West. So at this point I would stress that the people who were there and *part of it* were often some of the most enthusiastic backers of the 'print the legend' approach.

"Man, oh man, Suffice to say, finding sources on a niche topic like this were NOT easy, but they do exist! At least a few Dermatologic studies were published after the war and I was able to find a few of them, both of which focus on Acne in the Pacific Theater. While prior to the war acne was considered a nuisance more than something serious, American servicemen in the Pacific were found to be developing what came to be called ""tropical acne"", an extreme manifestation of the condition that could be physically debilitating and symptoms of which included ""large pustules, draining sinuses and extensive, disfiguring scars,frequently [keloidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid)"". To be sure, it isn't that the breakouts themselves were being caused by the men simply being in the Pacific - the studies indicate that a history of acne previous to service was a major factor - but various factors from the wartime environment, including ""increase in vasomotor activity, caused by the heat, plus the inadequate toilet facilities"" all contributed to severely affect men who had been sent to the Pacific. Being unable to clean, minor outbreaks could become infected, and many cases seem to have been serious enough that that the afflicted men were unable to continue serving on the front and had to be evacuated for more medical treatment, and many declared permanently unfit for duty.

Not all men who suffered breakouts were necessarily suffering from such acute symptoms though, and all in all, acne seems to have been one of the more common issues soldiers in the Pacific theater faced. As far as dermatological issues, at least, it was second only to tropical skin disease/fungal infections, with somewhere between 20 to 30 percent of all patients hospitalized for skin issues suffering from tropical acne.

As far as treatment goes, doctors found that standard treatments were generally quite ineffective and remaining in tropical conditions would generally cause a worsening. Attempts to use penicillin showed little real result while evacuation to cooler environments alone could cause real improvement in the condition, so that seems to have been the standard procedure.

So in short, someone else can weigh in on other theaters, but at least in the Pacific, Acne was a serious issue faced.

Edit: I was able to find one other source, which doesn't add to much to what has been said here beyond the [small addition here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/69dal7/was_painful_acne_ever_an_issue_in_ww2_if_i_slept/dh63f6r/) but does note that as far as the European theater goes ""[acne] was a condition of no consequence"".

"The tribes of northern California had origin myths that made reference to supernatural people/animals/deities from across the sea. These natives had origin myths that were complex and involved many different major characters. Kroeber described origin myths of many of the tribes as being a common spin on the same general theme; a deity or more comes from a certain distant place (often across the ocean), they arrive here and then create the world/places/critters. After creation, the supernatural beings go back home - across the Pacific.  

Among the Yurok, one myth tells of the creation of the ocean and acknowledges lands across the ocean. *Wohpekumeu*, a Yurok deity, was a widower from across the ocean. Among the Hupa a principal deity, *Yimantawinyay*, is literally ""old man across the water he goes"".

"I'm going to mostly center this around medieval London.

Assuming we took our time machine and warped an Ikea knife back 1000 years or so, from at least a _technical_ standpoint, yes, it'd be better.

It wasn't economical to use steel for the entirety of a medieval knife as it needed to be imported. (Generally less steel than, say, swords.) Knives were typically forged out of wrought iron, and in order to get the sharp edge, a harder steel portion was added. There could be variety in this; for example, it was possible to even have simply just wrought iron strips welded together, or an iron core with a steel edge wrapped around.

(In a survey of knives in medieval Russia, with more plentiful access to steel appropriate for such a use, there were knives made of layers of steel and iron. It still wasn't common to have an all-steel construction, though.)

This means, quite definitely, the modern knife is stronger, even putting aside the fact that modern manufacturing processes and metallurgic knowledge allow for higher consistency.

This isn't the entirety of the situation, though. Technology is also affected by culture. And the important question upon a medieval mind seeing the Ikea knife is what they'd categorize it as.

There were essentially two knife constructions in use, the ""whittle tang"" and the ""scale tang"". The whittle tang has the main part go back into the handle (sort of a hidden spike in the handle) whereas the scale tang has material (the handles or ""scales"") riveted to the top. (This terminology is also used for modern knives.)

The whittle tang was considered more of a general purpose blade, and it was of the type an average medieval person would have in a scabbard that is carried everywhere they go. For eating, it was both their tool for cutting food as well as their utensil, and they often had decorative elements as they were something of a personal statement. (You would not share your knife with others.) This cultural tendency lasted quite a long time and you can even see [in this 1640 painting by H. H. Kluber](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f989a983260c7c0b70e1e91003f9a85b/tumblr_inline_p6c75gUtku1r9wm7d_540.jpg) women with red dresses and knives attached to their waists. The Ikea knife would not be sutable for such a use (and even without the excessive size, the decorative aspect to the end might be considered inferior).

The scale tang design generally would be categorized by the medieval mind as a cleaver. Modern cleavers tend to have entirely flat cutting edges, but for the medieval butcher they would use the back flatter part of their blade for that purpose because they would also need the front part for a wider variety of cuts. Cleavers would be able to cut bone, knives would be for anything softer.

While I'm just again basing all this on a picture, while the Ikea knife might work for small animals, it wouldn't work too well for higher bone density. A butcher would also want the knife to be heavier as rather than applying force which would potentially break the knives they're used to (remember, the majority of their knife body would be iron) they would be relying on the weight of the knife to do the cut.

So, in summary: what would actually happen, assuming our time-warped knife dropped into medieval London. 1. people would assume it was for butchery because of the scale tang design 2. a butcher would try to use it but find it not thick enough to cut bone. In other words, your standard kitchen knife would not meet the cultural function of knives at the time so wouldn't be as useful as you'd think. Our theoretical medieval butcher may still have been able to figure out how to put the device to good use -- the archaeological record on specialty knives is scarce enough that they may even have had something similar -- but if we're talking about raw financial value, probably the fact the _entire_ Ikea knife is steel is the most noteworthy part, and the best route might be to simply melt it down for the high-quality steel in order to fashion something else.

"It's pretty much impossible to get statistics of any sort, for either the number of women who voted or how they did. (This is actually still a problem over a century later after full U.S. recognition of women's voting rights--scholars have dedicated a lot of effort to trying to piece together women's voting patterns in the 1920s!) However, there is anecdotal evidence showing women as supporters of both the Federalists and Republicans. Republican-affiliated newspapers published columns by women supporters; Federalist-supporting women participated in political riots in 1803 and 1804.

">That being said, there are thousands of years of human history, so why the medieval period specifically?

I can't help think that another huge part of ""why the medieval period specifically"" is (as you loosely touch on) because while they're are thousands of years of human history, the *actual* medieval period covered a full millennium and the vague technological mishmash that people tend to *call* medieval covers most of the rest.

Especially if you're taking about default D&D-style tough guide to fantasyland fantasy, the setting is less ""medieval"" than it is ""every country in the world at the exact point of its history and mythology for which it is most famous"" which means it's not uncommon to have a work where you can get on a boat in third dynasty Egypt, sail North to Versailles, then stop off in King Arthur's Court before crossing the ocean to fight eyepatch-wearing plank-walking pirates off the coast of the New World.

All of which codes as ""medieval"" because generally anything will code as ""medieval"" as long as it involves metal armour and no guns."

"I have to disagree with the part of your reply when it comes to the definition of the ""heartland"" of the Muslim world. This is a very Middle-East/Arab-centric view and doesn't take into account the fact that the vast majority of the Muslim world and the ones who gave legitimacy to the Ottoman claim of Caliph outside of the territory they controlled came from Asia and parts of Africa. For one, the vast majority of Muslims in the world live in South Asia and Southeast Asia with West, Northern and East Africa following close by. West Africans had [their own Caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoto_Caliphate) and never really gave allegiance to the Ottoman Caliphate. Moroccans and some West Africans also followed [a different line of Caliphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate) and believe that if anyone does have a claim to be Caliph, it would be the Royal family of Morocco. 

South Asian Islam is heavily rooted in Sunni/Sufi traditions following the [Hanafi School of Thought](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0082.xml#:~:text=The%20Hanafi%20School%20is%20one,Al%2DFiqh%20al%2DAkbar.), an ideology that they shared with the Ottoman Caliphate as do the majority of the Sunni Muslim world. If Saudi Arabia ever wanted to claim the Caliphate, it would be rejected on ideological grounds by the vast majority of the Muslim world. Even the Hashemite claim would be rejected as David Fromkin mentioned in his book A Peace to End All Peace, that many Sunni Muslims both in the Middle East and South Asia would have rejected the Hashemites as nothing more than opportunists, traitors (for leading the Arab Revolt), and cooperating with the British in their quest for Arab power.

I'd like to add that Shi'ites never recognized any of the Caliphates. The [Zaidis in Yemen had their own Imamate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imams_of_Yemen) whose reign ended in the 1960s (and ironically were backed by Saudi Arabia). The Ismailis also had their own Caliphs during Fatimid rule and ever since have been following their own Imam Agha Khan, Twelver Shi'ites, who make up the vast majority of Shi'ites do not have an Imam and are awaiting the Hidden Imam and the Mahdi and do not recognize the authority of the Caliph. The only ""sect"" that does have a Caliph at this moment are the Ahmadiya community whose leader is a religious one with no political authority.

"Great post! I am not an Inka scholar and have not read up on Inka too heavily, so I'm not familiar with some of the more specific details that you have discussed, but you raised some really relevant points that I think should be emphasized. 

Within popular depictions of the conquest of the Americas we often hear of overwhelming technological superiority, as though the natives of the Americas were helpless and hapless against technological superiors. Reality is much more complicated and nuanced than that. Yes, Spanish technology had a clear advantage for individual battles, but as you note there were a few Spaniards while the Inka had thousands of experienced soldiers. 

But the fact that the Inka empire had grown so quickly (often through direct military action or through coercion) and hadn't really begun to consolidate their power meant that they had a lot of enemies. Pizarro was quite a brilliant tactician and he quickly realized the tensions within the empire and were able to use those tensions to his advantage, including amassing armies from throughout the land who were happy to see the Inka fall. 

Specific to Machu Picchu, your last point is very important too: it was a palace, or a royal estate. It was a fancy retreat for the Inka emperor and his retinue, which he may have used during the winter months to take a vacation from Cusco (Cusco is about 1000m higher elevation than Machu Picchu and it gets pretty chilly in July and August). So Machu Picchu was a rural estate--built with all the temples, terraces, and other features that any royal Inka place should have, but a rural estate nonetheless--and as such it was probably a pretty minor concern for the nobility when the empire began to crash all around them.

I am not sure about history, but Inka archaeology has been seeing a bit of a resurgence in recent years. Since you haven't had the chance to add sources yet, here are a few that readers can go to for more info on these points:

"OK so, I actually want to come back to this, because you make a good point (and I went into more detail below) but I think if I were to go back and edit my post, I would actually rephrase it as:

*If someone makes a claim that you feel inclined to repeat, triple-check it.*

I think that's a better rule of thumb, on reflection. Because there aren't enough man-hours to confirm everything you read, whether it matches your pre-existing biases (and everybody has them, they're a natural consequence of having a knowledge base) or not. But if you're going to repeat a claim or integrate it into your worldview in such a way that you might reference it in a discussion, you had better be sure you haven't been taken in by b/s."
">Emperor of all Europe

Tsk tsk, please. This is the *real* Emperor of Europe speaking. I fought the French, Moors, and Heretics all simultaneously at the same time. You couldn't even handle the English. When you are ready to graduate from your boring and linear warfare, call me. "
"Generally, it operated the same for the peasantry as anywhere else: you'd make your own clothes. People in the Inca Empire tended to wear less clothes than Europeans, particularly at lower altitudes. The Anti people in the rainforests to the East wore very little, but they were also exempt from labour tithes because they were prone to rebellion and very good at it. 

For tools, etc they would be assigned by the State. If you needed it for your labour, it was supplied to you. This was simpler to deliver than it might seem, after all. Maize farms got maize farming tools. Fishing for coastal cities. Loom and weaving tools for Alpaca farms, etc, etc.

The bulk of the fine goods were taken directly to the Inca, who would then gift them to those he deemed worthy."
"You're right, the ""most correct"" answer is **""it depends.""** But, let's sort through some hypotheticals... you mention that you're a governor, meaning that your town must be significant enough to warrant having one, and therefore probably has enough in the way of defenses to potentially make it annoying and costly to capture. You say you're surrendering peacefully - let's presume that mean that essentially the Mongols say ""Hello, we're here, now submit."" And your response is to immediately throw open the city gates and reply, ""I thought you'd never ask, come in for some tea!"" And finally, let's just go ahead and assume that you are not personally responsible for whatever reason the Mongols went to war against your kingdom in the first place.

You and your city are, more likely than not, going to be fine. You will face a tribute payment, yes. But especially if you're one of the ""early birds"" who crosses over before it has become ""bleedingly obvious"" that your kingdom is going to be on the losing side - and *especially* if you can get some of your kinsmen already on the Mongol side to vouch for you - you might be looking at fairly low levels of relative taxation. Let's take a look at a case study - the Mongol conquest of Khwarazmia:

# Background

The Empire of Khwarazm existed across much of Persia, extending from the mountains of Aghanistan and Uzbekistan to the shores of the Black Sea, and including Transoxiana, Ferghana, Sistan, Khurasan, and Iraq-Ajemi. It was, in a word, *huge*. It was also a very young empire - having been won and formed in 1200 CE, it was only \~6 years older, in fact, than the Great Mongol Nation (*Yeke Mongol Ulus)* forged by Genghis Khan in 1206. In fact, across much of the first two decades of the 13th century, it was still far from a settled affair, and major fighting had only stopped in many of the regions as late as ca. 1215. As such the ruler of this Turko-Persian empire - variously styled as the Amir/Sultan, and self-styled the Shah (though the caliph in Baghdad rejected this presumption) - was every bit the brash conqueror-king with delusions of grandeur.

&#x200B;

The Mongol and Kwarazmian forces came to learn about one another existance right about this same time - the mid-1210's, albeit via radically differing means. The Amir of Kwarazm, having learned of a ""Golden Empire"" that he'd known as *Kitay*, far to the East that was wealthy beyond reckoning. Thus he dispatched an embassy/trade mission to go see what was up - since his men had informed him that there were disturbances in the region that threatened to undermine the lucrative supply of trade goods that transited his own territories. What they found after months of travel and entering the plain approaching the Central Capital of Jin, Zhongdu (mod. Beijing) was devastation beyond reckoning - a city so large as they'd never imagined with 40 foot high walls encompassing a region of more than 15 miles laid to absolute waste. The bleached, rotting bones of the city's dead stacked and strewn across the landscape in such great number that, at first, some in the party had mistaken the first sighting of whiteness coving the ground as an unseasonable snowfall... until the smell hit them. That was the first encounter of the Khwarazmians with the Mongols, or at least their handiwork.

For the Mongols of Genghis, it was a significantly less amazing affair. Having made war of the Kara-Khitan kingdom (AKA W. Liao), that had been usurped by an old enemy of the Great Khan - a Naiman called Guchlug - the Mongol pursue their defeated foe across the border and into Khwarazm territory, and they'd taken careful note of what they found. Genghis was greatly interested - a powerful state, and one far enough away to not pose an immediate threat, whose rulers had given him no cause for vengeance - in other words: a potential trading partner for the Silk Road goods he now controlled one terminus of.

After a round of negotiations, a deal was struck, and the Great Khan dispatched a vast caravan loaded with every manner of luxury - camel furs, silks, gold, silver, tea... you name it. And some 450-500 merchants and traders loyal to the Mongols, though primarily Muslim, and foreran by an Indian emissary bearing a letter of friendship to Amir Ala al-Din Muhammad II:

>​I have the greatest desire to live in peace with you. I shall look on you as my son. For your part, you are not unaware that I have conquered North China and subject all the tribes of the north. You know that my country is an ant heap of warriors, a mine of silver, and that I have no need to covet other dominions. We have an equal interest in fostering trade between our subjects. \[... I invite trade between our two peoples so that\] henceforth the abscess of evil thoughts may be lanced by the improvement of relations and agreement between us, and the pus of sedition and rebellion removed.

It was not, however, to be. Fatefully, the Mongol caravan’s route passed through the Khwarazmian province of Syr Darya, and its regional capital Otrar. The governor of Otrar was Inalchuq, a relation of Amir Muhammad’s mother. It was he who stopped the caravan’s procession and, after meeting with their ambassador and the othe heads of the group, order them all detained. The stated reason was that one of their number – a man Inalchuq had known previously – had supposedly addressed the Governor without his title, Ghayir-Khan. It would become quickly obvious, however, that this was little more than a convenient excuse, and that the governor in fact simply meant to seize the caravan’s rich cargo for himself. Upon taking the Mongol caravan captive, Inalchuq send a message to his Amir, telling him that he had captured a host of Mongol spies, and proposing their immediate execution. Whether because he actually believed his governor’s accusations, or – rather more likely – that he saw this as a chance to seize the goods for himself without need to pay it back, the Amir agreed to the execution of the entire party, and that the stolen goods be taken to Bukhara and sold.

In spite of this egregious offense – the killing of a Mongol ambassador was one of the most serious possible offenses, as was the theft of the Khan’s goods – Genghis as yet was willing to make a final attempt to avoid all-out war. A new embassy was sent to the Khwarazmian capital, this time consisting only of one Muslim and two Mongols to demand an explanation from Amir Muhammad for this egregious breach of international etiquette. Perhaps, after all, the Amir was blameless, and the blood lay on the offending governor’s hands alone. If that were the case, the ambassadors demanded, Muhammad must turn over the governor of Otrar to them in chains, to be taken back to Mongolia and face the Khan’s justice. At this, Muhammad balked – he would do no such thing, and the fact that these three foreigners had the audacity to stand before him making such demands was an insult to his station and power. Especially insulting to him was the fact that the lead ambassador was a Muslim – like himself – yet paid his service and loyalty to this heretical barbarian king. Muhammad II’s response was swift and damning: the Muslim ambassador was executed on the spot, and the two Mongols were instructed to ride back to Mongolia and inform their king that if he wanted his treasure back so badly, he’d have to come and take it, if he could. Yet before they were allowed to leave with their lives, the Amir had their beards shaved off – a sign of extreme humiliation – and the executed ambassador’s head sent with them in a box. All this was in 1218... the Mongols rode out for Khwarazm in early 1219. They'd arrive that autumn.

From the Secret History of the Mongols:

>\[Genghis\] rode past the settlement of Alai, taking with him his Merkid wife Khulan Khatun as companion, and leaving his brother Ochigin in command of the Great Camp at Avarga. The first army he sent out was commanded by Jebe, behind them he sent another led by Subedei, and behind them a third under Tokhuchar. Sending off these three commanders he told them: ‘Ride off to the outside of the Sultan’s armies and wait them until I arrive. Then you’ll attack from your side when I strike from mine.’

Though at first the Mongol armies rode past Kwarazmian cities without stopping or attacking, their mere presence had the – perhaps foreknown and intentional – effect of breaking most of the populace’s will to put up any resistance.  In droves, the populations fled to the Mongol lines to submit, and bringing with them yet further information about the fracture-points within the military and political situation of the enemy empire. Elsewise, they fled in the opposite direction – toward the nearest great city of the region: Bukhara. As far as the Mongol commanders were concerned, that was actually the better outcome. Just as they had done to the Jin Empire in the east, they now used terror as a means to stretch the supply limits of this sedentary society to, and then past, its breaking point. If they would hide behind their walls, as the Jurchen had done and as these Persians surely would as well… well, then best to fill those walls to the brim with useless mouths and grasping hands. Better to deplete the cities’ supplies and pillage their fars well ahead of the first mongol arriving at the city gates. The border towns under the command of Amin al-Mulk were thus taken and plundered, and the governor himself fled to the prince Jalal al-Din in an attempt to bolster each other’s forces against the Mongol advance.

OK... so now having established the relevant groundwork, let's get into the meat of your question..."

"As far as I can tell, no. The OED gives an example from 1000 AD of Ælfric of Eynsham's 'Grammar' that states ""B, c, d, g, p, t, geendiað on e."" i.e. ""B, c, d, g, p, t end in 'e'.""

The letter is taken from Greek to Latin for Greek words.""

'Z,' then, was seen as a non-Latinate letter by early English grammarians (it does exist, but in loan words) and so was pronounced in the Greek style. I don't know how the pronunciations of the letters formed in Latin (I study history of the English language) so I can't speak to that. "

"Great question! Unfortunately (or fortunately), it straddles different topics, eras, and historiography which makes it an adventure to answer and difficult to give you a single answer. This doesn't mean it can't be done, but in the spirit of Ask Historians, an answer about the layers of history in your question. And then an attempt at an answer.

First, there's the matter of what we can infer from children’s behavior centuries ago based on what adults put down in writing and which writing endured. There’s the use of your word “toddler” which is a fairly modernish term (usage dates to the late 1700) that describes a human in a particular stage of development distinct from previous or subsequent stages; and this notion of distinct stages has its own history. Then there's the specificity in your question around the “terrible twos” which is a very short window of time in a human’s life about which an adult may or may not write. (I feel comfortable saying two-year-olds medieval toddlers weren't keeping food and behavior journals.) Finally, there’s how the adults around the child constructed boundaries for behaviors and how they vary in terms of what’s considered an inappropriate tantrum or an appropriate expression of independence. These boundaries are shaped by a society’s – be it modern or medieval – thinking about gender, disability status, race, religion, class, the nature of childhood itself, the expectation of children, and in the case of your question, dietary habits. 

It's helpful to spend a bit more time thinking about one of the challenges in your question: your precision. It's a great detail, but alas, it makes it a bit harder to answer as a historian of the medieval era can probably shed some light on the eating habits of toddlers but likely won’t be able to explicitly say “yes, this thing happened” because the adults who wrote about children wouldn’t have used your level of precision. 

I often experience similar tensions in American education history, I can rattle off anecdotes I've come across from teacher journals from the mid-1800s where a child is described as misbehaving (her words), but the child’s age is often not noted (“the youngest Smith boy”) or is described in the context of when they attended school (“winter session.”) However, I also know that her journal writing is informed by the social pressure she experienced related to how well she did her job. So, it's difficult to know for sure if what she's describing as ""misbehavior"" was the sort of thing children did because they're children or truly something dangerous or harmful. And to complicate it, the same teacher might write home that the same child was an absolute hellion to her but through sheer force of will and motherly instincts, she was able to calm him down and teach him his letters. And of by the way, if the school board was interested in buying new books for the school, she knows this particular boy simply loves to read. Which is to say, she's a bit of an unreliable narrator with regards to the things children in her charge did. So, if you asked, ""have 7-year-old boys always hated school?"" I couldn't say for sure. I could tell you there are instances of teachers reporting boys around age 7 or so did not like doing the thing they asked them to do. 

Although related in historiography and themes to the history of education, there is a separate branch of historians who study the history of childhood and youth. It's their work that can help us understand the imprecision regarding age I described above is not a universal trait. As an example, Berner (2014) looked at the rituals in the lives of Ashkenazic Jews in the 1700s and could describe down to particular years how children were treated because a child's age played a role in the rituals of the community. From her 2014 article: ""very young infants were often brought to the synagogue, bringing toddlers and children under the age of three or five was usually discouraged."" So it's possible a historian of Ashkenazic Jewish childhood could speculate how two-year-olds might have responded to food they disliked, but it's difficult for us to extrapolate from one community to the broad category of human two-year-olds across an entire extended era. 

Finally, there's the issue of taste. That is, this idea we wouldn't eat something - or allow a toddler to pick and choose - because of the taste or flavor has its own complicated history that I dipped my toe in and promptly turned around. Perhaps a food historian can chime in on the history of food for toddlers - but again, it would difficult for us to extrapolate from taste to behavior to patterns over time. 

That said, I'm going to go out on a limb and say no. To be sure, historians can look at the historical record and reach different conclusions. It happens routinely and is, in truth, one of my favorite parts of ""doing"" history. So, it's entirely possible someone is writing another post in which they say, ""yes, and here's what leads me to that conclusion."" I, however, am going to say no, and here's why.

It's very possible that a two-year-old in 1066, when faced when a spoon full of food, offered a very strong opinion that indicated they did not want to eat that food, thank you very much. And given what we know about universalities of human development, it's very likely they did. However, the heart of your question is how the adults responded, not what the child did. The very notion of a tantrum is a fairly modern - 20th century - concept. That is, the idea of toddler expressing their opinion strongly and vocally in response to a request for an adult deserves its own name (""tantrum"") emerged from the idea that there is ""typical"" child behavior - or normal and abnormal behavior that needs to be redressed. 

I wrote about the field of Child Study in response to the question, ""[What is the history behind ""What is your favorite color?""](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hng4kq/what_is_the_history_behind_what_is_your_favorite/)"" and the movement's impact can be seen in your question, and in fact, the curiosity behind your question. In effect, they asked the same thing you're asking: why do small humans do these things that big humans don't? The founder of the movement, a man named G. Stanley Hall, was fascinated by this idea that the attributes of childhood could be observed and studied in the same way scientists studied the natural world. This isn't to say adults before the Hall came along in the late 1800s weren't curious about children's motivations - or had opinions - but rather, Hall created structures that gave rise to developmental psychology, child psychiatry, and societies for Mental Hygiene focused on children's behavior. 

While adults in previous eras would and could describe children's behavior on a continuum or scale in relation to their siblings or other children, what Hall and his contemporaries did was related to scale and norming. They collected thousands of anecdotes about children, detailing everything toddlers did and wrote about patterns. The field of child psychology encouraged doctors and parents to frame children's behaviors as good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. Kathleen Jones 1999 book, *Taming the troublesome child: American families, child guidance, and the limits of psychiatric authority.* goes into more detail about how this history evolved and explores how the theories behind a child's ""tantrum"" ran the gauntlet from ""their mother gave them too much attention as a baby"" to ""their mother didn't give them enough attention as a baby."" Public health, especially child health, was a very popular social issue in the early 1900s and doctors around the warned of disastrous events if a child's bad behavior weren't fixed. Thus, tantrums became something to be handled and fixed, rather than something children did. 

Which is to say, did medieval toddlers strongly and vocally express their opinions about food? Probably. Did parents see such opinions as abnormal behavior that needed to be handled? Likely not.

"# The Many Roads to Collaboration

There are many positive motivations for collaboration. Even after the Vichy regime had lost much of its legitimacy, Marshal Petain was still seen as a father figure for France. His refusal to shed unnecessary French blood in the First World War endeared him to the French nation, and even those who did not like the Vichy government respected Petain for his moral integrity. Many lost faith in the Vichy regime, but an equal amount retained faith in Petain as the head of Vichy. It is also important to remember right-wing, conservative sentiment was still popular in France. After all, nearly half of the population had voted against the left-wing Popular Front in May 1936. From a legal and constitutional standpoint, the Vichy government was considered the legitimate successor to the Third Republic, a point accepted by the French population and acknowledged by De Gaulle himself.

But more significantly, approval of the new regime was predominantly negative in nature. French shock and disgust concerning the manner of their defeat led to general public lethargy. Both German intelligence agents and French prefects noted that the majority of the population had sunk into discouragement and fatigue. Physical needs took precedence over political motivation, especially as Germany stepped up its exploitation of French resources. When French caloric intake became the lowest in western Europe, it is not hard to imagine that citizens cared more for their bellies than moral resistance. As shown in the preface, to resist or not to resist was a hard choice for every French citizen living in occupied or Vichy France. Collaboration does not only mean active cooperation. The day-to-day functioning of the occupied society and state is invariably tied with assistance given to the occupier. Farmers, civil servants, policemen and waiters all face the choice of conforming to a system which benefits those who collaborate or to resist and face the danger of being excluded from the system. The choice to collaborate or resist is not only a moral and political decision, but also one that directly affects your livelihood, your family and your personal safety.

In many cases, resistance occurred due to personal needs instead of political motivation. Lynne Taylor’s *Between Resistance and the Collaboration* records significant strikes in 1940 and 1941 by French industrial workers and miners which were harshly suppressed by the Germans. However, the strikes were not over a refusal to assist the German war effort, but over long working hours and low pay. Around 150 food riots also occurred in the 1940-1942 period, but all were aimed at poor governance instead of the legitimacy of the Vichy regime. Material shortages took precedence over political ideology.

To actively resist was to take the hard path. It meant the abandonment of normal life and a descent into lawlessness, into long periods of hiding and running. Those who did so abandoned families and friends who became targets of reprisals. Nor would the French Resistance be seen in a particularly good light by their compatriots. As Julian Jackson notes, “it became harder to feel sympathy for young men fleeing STO \[compulsory work service in German industrial plants\] once they had started stealing crops.” Even at its very height, official record calculated active Resistance participation to be only about 2% of the adult French population.

For many, a synthesis of the above factors influenced their decision to keep their heads down and simply pretend they were dealing with a legitimate French government. It is easy for us with hindsight to say: ""Yes, of course I would've actively resisted the Nazis and the collaborators!"" But for those who lived in occupied and Vichy France, their choices were determined by their actions, not their words.  I think Paxton’s conclusion in *Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order* is rather fitting:

>Some of France’s best skill and talent went into a formidable effort to keep the French state afloat under increasingly questionable circumstances. Who would keep order, they asked, if the state lost authority? By saving the state, however, they were losing the nation. Those who cling to the social order above all may do so by self-interest or merely by inertia. In either case, they know more clearly what they are against than what they are for. So blinded, they perform jobs that may be admirable in themselves but are tinctured with evil by the overall effects of the system. Even Frenchmen of the best intentions, faced with the harsh alternative of doing one’s job, whose risks were moral and abstract, or practicing civil disobedience, whose risks were material and immediate, went on doing the job. The same may be said of the German occupiers. Many of them were “good Germans,” men of cultivation, confident that their country’s success outweighed a few moral blemishes, dutifully fulfilling some minor blameless function in a regime whose cumulative effect was brutish.  
>  
>Readers will prefer, like the writer, to recognize themselves in neither of these types. It is tempting to identify with Resistance and to say, “That is what I would have done.” Alas, we are far more likely to act, in parallel situations, like the Vichy majority. Indeed, it may be the German occupiers rather than the Vichy majority whom Americans, as residents of the most powerful state on earth, should scrutinize most unblinkingly."

"Modified from a previous answer of [mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/791t3n/based_on_the_rnews_front_page_post_wealth_is_more/),

There have been 4 studies on wealth inequality that I have read. There is the Survey of Consumer Finance Report by the Federal Reserve, a paper by Sylvio Allegretto from the Economic Policy Institute and two papers last by Saez (one with Zuckman and the other with Kopczuck) but I will be using the two papers by Saez for this answer. To estimate wealth inequality, Emmanuel Saez and Wojciech Kopczuck have considered four categories: tangible assets (real estate, consumer durables), fixed assets (bonds, stocks), corporate stocks, income from unincorporated business and farms and subtracted liabilities (mortgages and other forms of Consumer debt) to obtain the net wealth of people at different quintiles. They have also included pension plans like 401-K, IRA and excluded benefits from Social insurance schemes like Social Security. 

It is important to start with the total wealth that has been produced in the country. Between 1916 and the start of the World War 2, there was no increase in net wealth because a large portion of it was destroyed during the Great Depression. There was a steady and impressive increase during the portion between 1940 and mid-1960's and a marked slowdown during the period from 1970's till 1990's. There has been a similar trend noticed for growth in productivity (i.e the total amount of goods and services produced per person in a year) and income. Similarly, the composition in wealth held by the top 1 percent as changed. During the period between 1916 and 1930, around 70 percent of wealth was held in stocks as financial markets and the real economy boomed during the 1920's when new Industries were created due to improvement in technique of labor, increase in stocks of machinery, commercialization of technologies and paradigm shifting management practices like Fordism and Taylorism. A comparatively underdeveloped financial market(from today's perspective!) meant that there was little scope in diversifying holdings and the stock markets boomed anyway. 

In 1929, the top 1 percent held 40 percent of the total wealth which fell to 30 percent between 1929 and 1932 because of the stock market crash and a catastrophic economic situation in general. Their share continued to decline during the New Deal Period and World War 2. By 1949, it had fallen to 22.5 percent. The corresponding share of 0.1 percent and 0.01 percent was down from 20 percent to 10 percent and 10 percent to 4 percent respectively. The period between 1950 and 1965 saw an increase in wealth inequality with the share of the top 1 percent going back to 25 percent. It fell to a new all-time low of 19 percent in 1970's and saw a significant bump in 1980's to 22 percent but it remained constant hereafter till 2000. The authors trace it to the creation and expansion of defined benefit pension plans, mutual funds and financial innovation, and a greater number of households participating in the stock market boom keeping the share of the top 1 percent in check. Indeed, today the share of the stock Investments in the portfolio of the top 1 percent is at 38 percent which is lower than the general population.There was a great boom for Corporate America following the War but relatively high taxes (even excluding deductions, breaks, and loopholes) kept the return on corporate equity low.

Similarly, the Roosevelt administration hit the top wealth holders with estate taxes and gift taxes which were not so easy to evade. There was an increase in income taxes as well but as I have pointed out in another answer, there was a relatively little impact in the period between 1932 and 1940, as the share of the top 10 percent remained at 40 percent before falling dramatically and remaining there till 1980's. The result might appear somewhat surprising given the general trend of rising inequality. But as Saez points out, it was income inequality that increased dramatically and not wealth inequality. This is not contradictory as it sounds. The share of labor income, as opposed to Capital income, has declined but much of that can be traced to increase in the value of housing because of the Housing Bubble. The economist Peter Orszag noted, it was labor income and not Capital income that increased inequality because of rising compensation for executives, people in the financial sector and to a lesser extent high tech sector.  Piketty, Saez et al have estimated that it could take one or two decades for a person in top 0.1 percent income bracket to enter into 0.1 percent of wealth bracket even with a good investment strategy and high saving rate.

The last paper however revised estimates of the earlier paper by Saez and Kopczuk. Saez and Zuckman noted the first paper assumed a constant mortality differential between the wealthy and the rest of the population. However, that was not the case and once you account for that the authors note that wealth inequality increased substantially in mid to late 1980's and thereafter. The share of the top 10 percent peaked at 84 percent in 1920's before falling to a low of 65 percent in 1980's (before the Tax Reform of 1986) and has increased to 77 percent today. However, much of the increase in the share of the top 10 percent is due to increase in the share of the top 1 percent. The authors trace it to the fact that returns on Corporate equities and fixed income claims are higher as compared to pensions and housing wealth and decline in saving rate by middle-income families owing to low-income growth and rising costs for education and healthcare. Corporate equities owned by the top 0.01 percent account for 4.5 percent of wealth today as opposed to 1.2 percent in 1980's. The corresponding share for fixed income increased from 1.0 percent to 5.4 percent. The saving rate for the top 1 percent is 20 percent, for the next 9 percent, it is 10 percent and 3 percent for the bottom 90 percent. Similarly, the rise of housing prices has benefited the top 10 percent more than the others as the value of their homes tends to be larger and they own their houses without any mortgage at a greater rate. Meanwhile, the increase in debt (credit cards, mortgages, student loans etc) has cut into the net worth of the bottom 90 percent.

awesome answer and thank you :)
"The idea that the AD/CE calendar is ""off"" four years from the birth of Jesus is an early modern invention. It's not usually related to a criticism of Dionysius' work, though. The attempts that I'm aware of revolve around astronomical dating--either the use of a lunar eclipse to date the death of Herod (during whose reign Jesus was born, a la the Gospels) or some kind of extra-bright appearance (comet, supernova, etc) that could be Star of Bethlehem referenced in Matthew (which is a problem for a whole host of other reasons, such as that the whole story smells *very* strongly of messianic trope).

On the other hand, it's not actually known (a) how Dionysius calculated the incarnation of Christ or (b) whether his idea of ""incarnation"" meant the *birth* or the *conception* of Christ. So if he did make a math mistake, we honestly would have no way of knowing."
"The EIC was founded Dec. 31, 1600 and ceased operations in 1874. What I’m referring to above is the founding of a trading post in what’s now Singapore by Stanford Raffles in 1819."
"As usually, thank you for a great answer :) If I may ask additional question:

>Medieval villages were not isolated outposts, and medieval peasants were not Kevin.

Where does this popular notion stem from? A lot of people seem to think that your average premodern peasant is as intelligent and knows about their surroundings as a cow staring at a barn door (as we sometimes say where I live). Why are people usually so quick to think of the past - specifically the Middle Ages - as a bastion of stupidity and ignorance, and when did this start happening?"
"Segregation of banks would, of course, depend on the laws of the state you were in, but even outside of the regions that existed under the apartheid regime of Jim Crow, the early 20th century is notable for being the point when African-American banking began to take form. Legal segregation may not have existed, but common beliefs that African-Americans had no assets meant that few financial institutions had any interest in catering to them. Focusing on Chicago, for instance, in 1900, there were only seven African-Americans who identified themselves on the US Census as 'bankers', and no banks which were considered 'black' but over the next few decades that began to change.

The First Binga Bank was established in 1908 by Jesse Binga. He was a wealthy African-American realtor who had the personal financial assets to essentially create a bank out of thin air. Rumor plagued him about the real source of his wealth, as his wife was the sister of a notorious gambler, John V. Johnson, but Binga was a self-made man who had made smart investments in land and property, and settled in Chicago, home to a fast growing black community. His bank wasn't specifically aimed at catering to the black community, and in fact the majority of his customers were white, but it was nevertheless an important step, both in the *equal* treatment of black customers, and the simple presence of black-owned financial institutions within the black community.

He would see several more branches open up, and although the first black bank in Chicago, he was quickly followed by a several more including R.W. Hunter & Co. Bank and A.W. Woodfolk Bank. These institutions provided openings into finance that had been cut off to black persons, and also brought in stability to those communities. R.W. Hunter, in his promotion of his own company, proudly proclaimed it to be ""a substantial enterprise, owned, controlled and actively managed by Colored men and women [that] has developed into an important asset of Chicago.""

Back before the FDIC, banking - of any color - wasn't always a guarantee in those days though, although the racial aspect certainly brought in further dangers. The R.W. Hunter Bank had expanded quickly, but then started to suffer and was floated by a loan from the A.W. Woodfolk Bank, which didn't prevent it from going bankrupt. The Woodfolk Bank, in turn, was a target during the 1919 Race Riots in the city, which saw one of its properties firebombed. The resulting run on the bank from frightened investors and depositors shutting it down, although it ended up in receivership, not total closure, under P.W. Chavers, who continued the commitment to ""serve African Americans in such a matter as to instill greater confidence in black banks and bankers, produce progress for his race, and accumulate wealth for himself and his family."" 

Binga's Bank would survive longer, but as with many institutions worldwide, couldn't make it through the 1929 Crash and ensuing depression. The 1920s would also see the biggest advancement, under the leadership of Chavers, with the accrediting of the Douglass National Bank, which was the first African-American bank to be nationally chartered, allowing it to put into circulation US banknotes with the signature of the bank President, Anthony Overton, a source of immense pride within the community at the time. It too, though, would fall victim to the Depression, clawing through for a few more years before closing up shop in 1932.

So anyways, to wrap things up, the early 1900s saw a rise of black banking, not just in Chicago, although that was the focus here. Wealthy African-Americans were able to put up the capital to begin these institutions, and they provided banking colorblind services, as well as employment opportunity in finance, both things which white-owned institutions generally failed to do. The institutions were honest, as any other bank, at the least, but they suffered from the instability of banking prior to the FDIC, and a number of them went under; in some cases as a direct result of racial animus, and in others from the simple mundane sort of failures that can impact any bank. While they existed through, they were an important backbone of the African-American community, not only providing deposit and investment opportunities to black persons of Chicago, but also an important point of community pride and stability.

"I would like to add soldiers were not allowed to simply tear off the sleeves of their uniforms because it was hot.  To be honest that's actually not a good idea because they used sleeves to protect themselves from mosquito bites.

Every branch of service has uniform regulations and dictates that a uniform must be serviceable.  What is commonly depicted in Vietnam war films, such as willfully destroying their uniforms by tearing off sleeves and putting graffiti on helmets, is in direct violations of uniform military regulations and would be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice as a non-judicial punishment if they did not fix it.

For example, under AR 670-1 3-6 Uniform appearance and fit, it states ""Personnel must keep uniforms clean, serviceable, and roll-pressed, as necessary.""  While this is the current AR 670-1, AR670-5 would have similar language.  So while, yes it would be impossible for a soldier to ensure their uniform was always clean out in the field it's quite clear destroying a uniform by tearing off the sleeves was a huge NO, even in tropical climates.

Typically what they did was roll their sleeves.  You can google images of the Vietnam war and see most soldier rolled their sleeves.  In fact, very few pictures show soldiers with destroyed uniforms, usually caused by combat injuries."
"If you’re a chaski runner, odds are you know your way around the route you’ve been running - it’s quite likely you’ve been conscripted for your duties from the local area. Your *tambo* way station may be a few miles from home, but it’s likely not too far. You only need to pass whatever *qhipu* messages - or perhaps fresh fish for the Sapa Inca, maybe he asked for some for dinner! - from your tambo to the next one. Then you’ll pass it on relay-race style. You may be one of only a few people around with ready access to the royal road (Qhapaq Ñan) that isn’t military - the road is for imperial business alone.

As for what would happen to a middle-aged chaski, well, it’s likely there’s some land you can be working on - either your own, or otherwise you may be asked to fulfill your *mita* labor service to the empire by working on the royal estates or performing local maintenance on those way stations and roads I just mentioned. Food and security will be covered by the Inca from storehouses you pay into, and they’ll very possibly be quite sensitive to the needs of the household and community. Which is to say, if you’re the only male head of household the Inca will find other ways to get their mita, or else they’ll only conscript you when your fields don’t need a lot of attention. Planting and harvesting are both moments of “all hands on deck” for a village. Hopefully your community was...amicably brought into the Tawantinsuyu. But of course, if you were sufficiently recalcitrant, there’s a good chance you’d never see your family or friends again, having been completely atomized and sent to far corners of the empire to act as migrant workers on royal estates.

Now, as you get very old, you may end up taking on a job traditionally reserved for women - weaving. Hard for you to pass the chaqitaqlla (digging plow) into the ground, but you can drop spindle some thread for your wife or niece, and maybe even get passable at working the loom. Of course, there’s likely all manner of political negotiation and labor distribution you could while away your time with, too.

EDIT for sources: Okay, now that I'm awake, caffeinated, and questions have been answered, here's a couple good sources on Inca infrastructure:

John Hyslop's 1984 *The Inca Road System* from Academic Press of New York, and his follow-up in 1990 *Inka Settlement Planning* from University of Texas Press, are both excellent resources. Hyslop followed many of the old roads (traveling on a motorcycle, natch) and investigated/reviewed the chronicles to confirm.

John Rowe, in 1946 wrote for Julian Steward's *Handbook of South American Indians* with a chapter of about 150 pages called ""Inca Culture at the Time of the Spanish Conquest"". It is a classic, and still quite insightful for those curious about the ins and outs of Inca practices.

In another comment below, I mentioned a few good baseline resources to tackle Andean studies in general, and the Incas in particular. There's plenty more if you have particular questions!

Today the Qhapaq Ñan is UNESCO world heritage, stretching across six countries (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and a tiny tip in Colombia) - there are more reports and information out there too. Happy to vet any sources that crop up in your own search for more information!"
"There's always more than can be said about his specific name and family history, but I wrote an answer on the German immigrant experience in schools that gets at some of what you're asking. The full answer is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bs91yh/how_common_was_it_for_german_immigrants_to_hide/eomysw2/) but the part I think might be most relevant for your question is about the shifting nature of whiteness in America and geographical differences:

> It should be said World War I, and tensions before the war, negatively impacted the dynamic between German Americans and their neighbors. Indiana and Texas, for example, had been a welcome place for German immigrants, including mandated German instruction in most Indiana high schools as a way to explicitly draw German immigrants to the state. (Basically, they were saying, ""your child will do well in at least one class in school and we're cool with them speaking German."" In 1900, more than 200 American public schools in more than a dozen states used this approach to appeal to German immigrants.) Steps, though, by xenophobic Americans brought a swift halt to German language and cultural education. Many of the men advocating for an end to anything and everything German in schools were engaged in what can best be described as ""superpatriotism."" They saw it as their responsibility to rid their schools of any vestiges of the enemy, even though they had lived side by side with German immigrants for generations. But again, it was location dependant; New York State offered German language high school courses and corresponding exit exams until well into the modern era.
> 
> Generally speaking, the pushback against Prussia in American schools during and after World War I was a general prejudice against all things German. A great deal of this was tied up in how white Americans have set and shifted the boundaries around who counted as white. That is, German Americans weren't kicked out of the tent of whiteness - German speaking children were still allowed to attend public schools and German speaking adults were paid the same as other workers, whereas Black Americans were still barred from schools and paid less. So, while a German immigrant in the 1920's and 1930's may have felt the impact of nativism and xenophobia and elected to minimize the things that would draw attention, it would have been a matter of choice. The sentiment of the xenophobia would shift from German culture in general to German American children in specific by World War II. As an example, the topic of ""disordered"" thinking of American children raised in households speaking in German was a popular topic for dissertations well into the 1950's.

I'm also going to leave a link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/djgvb7/what_was_the_americanization_process_for/f474phv/) to a question about the ""Americanization"" process for immigrants, including some history about the (not exactly accurate) idea immigrants were forced to change or Americanize their name when arriving at Ellis Island or other immigration points."
"there are two major facts that led to pizza becoming THE dish to be ordered via telephone and delivered to the home.  


After World War II, the telephone networks saw rapid expansion and more efficient telephone sets, such as the model 500 telephone in the United States, were developed that permitted larger local networks centered around central offices. A breakthrough new technology was the introduction of Touch-Tone signaling using push-button telephones by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1963.   


While, at the same time  an estimated 600,000 of Italians arrived in America in the decades following the war. As was, and still is a regular occurrence for immigrants, a large number of them ended up working in the food industry, often opening inexpensive restaurants serving Italian food.  


Which was a fortuitous choice, because not long before, the American veterans of campaigns in Italy returned home, with a taste for Italian food already developed.  


As it were, first inexpensive and proliferated telephones, and the influx of cheap, tasty Italian food was a match made in heaven. The startup family restaurants ran by Italian immigrants could not compete with established food industry, could not afford rent on big floors required for a major restaurant to sit enough clients to support themselves, But they could deliver the food to the homes of their patrons; both to other Italian-Americans, as well as a growing number of other ethnicities as well.   


This, in turn, worked well with an increased demand for ready-made food, required due to an increasing percentage of women joining the workforce and thus unable to cook at home.  


Now, this part was easy to answer, but why PIZZA of all the possible Italian dishes?  


There is no definite answer, as usual for matters of taste and preference. I would approach it from a perspective on not a historian, but an archaeologist of technology.  


Pizza, at its most basic, is simply a flat-bread with cheap toppings. Flat bread is by far the most popular dish in the world, eaten in various forms by virtually every culture known to historians, but especially popular among Mediterranean cultures. It is very cheap, calories-dense, does not spoil easily, easy to transport, share and cut, and can be eaten with anything.  
We know it as pita, naan, flatcakes, or chatapouri, but its pizza that manages to be both cheap, and ""luxurious"" looking enough to be sellable to strangers who might be not familiar with it. It requires no rare ingredients, the procedure of making it is easy, and about the only non standard piece of equipment needed is a wide oven. It is also easily stackable and transportable, which was a non trivial matter to delivery men in 1950s automobiles and bike delivery.

"Country music's origin myth is famously on July 28th, 1927, in Bristol Tennessee, when Ralph Peer, an A&R man at the Victor Recording Company, set up shop looking for local talent, which he found in the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers. This is the origin myth for country music because it marks a clear dividing line between the folk music of the people and country music as a commercial enterprise, country music as a kind of (rural) pop music; both Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family became massive stars, and their success inspired many others to try and make it big in what was initially called hillbilly music and later country music. So while there was certainly a variety of music that would have sounded fairly country music before 1927 - the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers obviously didn't grow up artificially in petri dishes - it's the point at which rural Appalachian/Southern folk music and country music become different things, especially after it becomes a big commercial enterprise, and the likes of the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers run out of interesting new traditional folk songs to do, and you get the likes of Roy Acuff writing new pop songs rather than just relying on the traditional music. So that's why I draw a distinction there - it's the point at which it starts to make sense to talk about a country music establishment pandering to audiences."

"Please could you comment on the history of perceiving _pre_-WWII corporations as evil? [This New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/opinion/east-india-company.html) has a fair go at drawing parallels between the Royal Dutch Shells etc. of today and the original East India Company. As you noted, there was a post-WWII ""shift from government-centric-dystopian-fiction towards corporation-centric-dystopian-fiction"", but this doesn't preclude there being a shift from corporation-centric-dystopian-fiction to government-centric-dystopian-fiction before the government got involved in e.g. the World Wars. Is Charles Dickens' _A Christmas Carol_ not an anti-laissez-faire-capitalist critique of Victorian society, constituting a version of corporation-centric-dystopian-fiction?"
"There's a great book on mirrors that I need to recommend: [In the Looking Glass: Mirrors & Identity in Early America](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/looking-glass) by Rebecca K. Shrum.  To start with this question, there isn't a clear ""not knowing"" of how people looked.  Shiny objects and water offered reflections that gave people a general sense of their appearance, albeit distorted.  Really, the change mirrors brought was the ability for people to accurately see themselves instead of a distorted image.  The way you look in a spoon or a pond looks incredibly different from a mirror.  The technology to make mirrors began in the European Renaissance, however it was over the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that they became commonplace. Early mirrors might mean a couple of things like looking glasses (glass blown in with a spherical bend) or small metal pieces, which were often used for trade in the early colonization of North America.

&#x200B;

Schrum cites research that found mirror ownership by the English middling class nearly doubled between 1675 and 1725. Similar growth occurred on both sides of the Atlantic.  Mirrors also served to illuminate homes, so in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as they became common, more mirrors where built with candleholders attached.

&#x200B;

As for impact, Shrum discusses how a number of groups experienced mirrors and accurate reflections.  These were somewhat luxury goods, especially depending on the quality.  In WPA interviews taken in the 1930s, formerly enslaved people referred to mirrors, often linking them to freedom.  In one example, Millie Manuel described her home during enslavement, ""We had timber rail house.  No beds in it. We slep' on the floor on a pallet.  We didn't have no chair and we didn't have no mirror...I didn't knowd what I looked like 'til I was free.""  Imagination of a person's appearance was tied to freedom.

&#x200B;

Europeans traded mirrors with Native Americans as a common good that crossed cultural lines.  Most European mirrors came in a case or frame.  However, Indigenous people often removed the casing to put in their own holders or even sew onto clothing.  It was so common that they sometimes requested mirrors to take the glass for their own modifications.

&#x200B;

Mirrors also gave nineteenth century women the opportunity to define their public image.  Whereas their public self was determined by men who looked at them, mirrors gave women the chance to look at themselves.  Some women even trusted mirrors more than their friends when determining their appearance.  That reforms an idea of societal power where previously others needed to confirm or advise, people could reclaim that authority in curating their selves.

Again, I strongly recommend Shrum's book which goes into further detail on all these ideas, especially the relationship between whiteness and mirrors.  I did my best to summarize the main arguments here, but I'll finish with a direct quote from the conclusion that captures the core thesis:

>Mirrors, as we have seen, also offered people extended opportunities to engage with an accurate image of themselves and to construct a self-identity that relied at least partially on that image, a quintessentially modern practice.  Men and women of African, Native, and European descent embraced the mirror's ability to make self-knowledge available to them (Shrum, 160)."
Great text. Thank you so much!
"This a very good answer and very informative but i believed that also swords at the time were largely symbolic and were generally back up weapons. I understand that this is the case with medieval knights and that pole weapons were preferred in the battlefield. In a way i understand that they were comprable to handguns, very effective for self defense but not ideal for the battlefield. Was this also the case in Japan with the katana and Tachi?"
"Instances are known where certain requirements were waived for African-American men, but always in situations where the man was willing to vote Democrat. Holloway notes the case of Silas Green, who had committed some small time crime, who had been allowed to vote when he balloted Democrat, but upon switching his affiliation, was challenged by the Democratic election officials. It is important to note that in 1880, Reconstruction had only just ended and while ascendant, the Redeemers didn't necessarily feel quite in total control, so as Holloway aptly describes, this form of waiver for specific black persons was *""particularly effective because they offered Democrats a flexible but effective way to manipulate the vote when a close race was at hand.""* They quite literally could create voters if needed, but immediately prevent further voting if they believed that person would no longer support them. This would, of course, become less necessary and less common as the Jim Crow laws were passed and the white ruling elite came to feel more secure in power, and there was no longer any need to court any black voters.

The impact of such laws is stark. During Reconstruction, in Louisiana, 130,000 black men were voters. After the state was ""redeemed"", 5,000 black voters were registered. And even those few who were able to get through every hurdle thrown their way still had to contend with the intimidation and threats that would be directed their way for daring to make use of their right. Other states saw similar declines in the late 19th century (although by the early 20th century numbers would again rise as black community organizers worked to fight back and take back the vote). 

So at this point, I would again insert a caveat that I'm speaking only to the process in the South. As discussed, the ante-bellum period saw minimal registration, with eligibility essentially claimed at the polls, and offered up in judgement to the election officials as part of the community ritual that surrounded the electoral process. The emancipation and enfranchisement of African-Americans, however, was an existential threat to the white elites who, with the end of Reconstruction, used, among other schemes, stricter requirements for voter registration to institute technically non-racial laws to prevent actual impact of black suffrage from being felt. This was not the only factor worthy of discussion - I'm sure that someone else who wishes to could expand on the change in the Northern states or the impact of increasing urbanization where community recognition no longer could be a guarantee, among others, but at least in the American South increasingly strict laws for voter registration are intimately tied to racial politics and attempts to maintain white supremacy.

1: As a side note given the premise and how people *really* want to discuss that, I take no issue with the premise. There is no Federal law in place that requires registration outside of those regulated by the National Firearms Act, and this is in fact banned by the Firearm Owners Protection Act. 4473 Forms are kept by dealers upon sale, and turned into BAFTE under certain circumstances, where they keep them but can't digitize them, but this is not legally considered a registry, and private sales require no paper trail whatsoever, so if it were, it still wouldn't be a *requirement* to buy a gun, just a requirement to buy one that isn't used. So no, there is not a requirement to register firearms, and so being in a state that doesn't have a state level one, if I wanted to I could meet a sketchy dude in a parking lot at 3 am to buy an entire arsenal ~~in unmarked, non-sequential bills~~ with BitCoin and that would be totally legal. As with voting, various states have their own requirements, which can include registration, as FOPA doesn't restrict the states, and SCOTUS has not held anything like that to be unconstitutional to date, but that doesn't make the premise incorrect. 

If you want to nitpick a premise, is that there is a requirement to register to vote, as it is basically the same deal. Federal laws and the Constitution say what the state's *can't* do, but it is basically left entirely to them to decide the specifics, or whether to require registration at all, although only North Dakota requires none."

"For Virginia, the state had little industry   until after the Civil War: it had an agricultural economy.  In that it was like much of the South, where there were few large cities . Atlanta and Birmingham may be the biggest cities now, in their states of Georgia and Alabama,  but they're pretty recent- Birmingham was only founded in 1871, Atlanta was founded earlier, but in 1860 was still pretty much just a railroad junction of around 10,000.  Southern towns like Norfolk, Memphis, Baltimore and New Orleans became big because of shipping and trade- but they were few. 

Actually, the very sparse farming population of Virginia was seen as a problem in the early 1700's. Craftsmen didn't want to try to set up shop in the middle of nowhere, where they not only had trouble getting customers but trouble obtaining supplies. And the plantations tended to be their own small self-sufficient operations. Later, there would be craftsmen working in Williamsburg, serving the region, but even then it was common for the Virginia elite to have things sent from England- it was what England preferred, as well."

I find it fascinating that a ""catastrophic economic situation"" results in reduced economic inequality."
"Terrific answer.  I do think it's also worth pointing out that one significant aspect to Jefferson's precarious financial situation prior to his Presidency was the infamous nail factory.  He actually made money on it for a few years starting in 1794 but then just got clobbered as more efficient manufacturing techniques replaced what were largely handmade nails; even with enslaved labor, I've seen estimates he was losing something like $5,000+ a year on it later on and it stayed open for years.

What's interesting, incidentally, is if you ever get a chance to look at some of the electronic maps of which families owned Virginia land by year in the late 1700s and 1800s.  No idea if they're online, but you can see that as various FFV families got in financial trouble - which Jefferson's reaction was commonplace, as finances were something they would *not* talk about in that social circle - how bits and pieces of their property would get sold off from year to year.  That along with the people they'd enslaved were their two main assets."

"The other big issue with Heyerdahl is that he tended to conflate physical possibility with evidence. Heyerdahl proved, through his various different expeditions, that one can theoretically sail from just about anywhere to just about anywhere using almost any kind of watercraft.

However, while that seemed to prove to him that his theories were correct, it proved to everyone else the absolute need for more evidence. We know for certain that everyone didn't sail everywhere since rafts were invented, and yet we know that since rafts have existed, we've theoretically been able to do just that.

None of this theories, then, hold any water on their own, because the only evidence any of them really have is that it was theoretically possible to reach Point B from Point A."

"As u/crying-child notes, the Left wasn't a monolith. The Socialist Party was particularly contentious - with divides between labor and academy, reformers and militants, and the like. It's also worth noting that the New Deal was so successful that it managed to attract a lot of moderates and intellectuals on the Left towards the Democrats, who tired of the contentiousness between the Old Guard and the younger Militants. But we can look at it the New Deal through the eyes of some of the Socialist Party's leaders - like perennial presidential candidate (and former Presbyterian minister/Social Gospel proponent) Norman Thomas.

Thomas believed that the New Deal put through a weaker version of nearly the entire Socialist Party of America's platform. He also believed the New Deal got more done than he probably could have, and in a very short period of time. And Thomas respected this, thinking that although it was ""hopelessly inadequate"" it was a start in a good direction and even conceded that were Thomas president, he would have used his first hundred days in the same way Roosevelt did. He, and other Labor leaders like Abraham Cahan honestly considered making Roosevelt a kind of honorary member of the Socialist party - if only he would consider nationalizing banking and coal-mining.

Thomas had a two big complaints about the New Deal, though. First, predictably, that it wasn't radical enough. It was ameliorative, but it didn't actually address the core philosophical and ethical problems of America. The New Deal for all its benefits preserved and protected capitalism, albeit in more of a state-capitalism form that many feared was similar to fascism. And second (and this betrayed part of why the Old Guard socialists, particularly in the Midwest really distrusted him) - the New Deal did not empower people of color. Roosevelt's administration, and the New Deal program maintained the unjust racial status quo - in particular within the agricultural aspects of the New Deal. 

So from Thomas' perspective, the New Deal was really a mixed bag. It did a lot of what Thomas really wanted to do. In fact, it did more than Thomas could have possibly done for the poor. It also didn't do enough, and its blindspots were very concerning. In the end, Thomas (erroneously) blamed the New Deal's successes for the collapse of the Socialist Party. That might be part of the truth, but it's certainly not the whole of it.

"There will be more to say, and doubtless other examples to proffer, but perhaps the medieval ""peasant republic"" of Dithmarschen is the closest fit for the sort of community you are envisaging.

Located on the North Sea coastline in the marshy confluence of what is now the borderlands of Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, Dithmarschen was an ethnically Saxon enclave in a part-Danish, part- Frisian border district that lay within the perpetually-contested border between Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire.

This poor, low-lying and swampy district endured as what was to all intents and purposes an independent polity for 330 years, from 1227 to 1559, and was – according to William Urban, author of the only study of the place in English – a ""unique"" society whose ""form of government violated nearly every generalization made about the medieval period.""

This was not an area of much strategic significance, and nor was it an hospitable environment:

>The coast is largely marsh – salty, forbidding, and ever-changing under the lash of storm and tide... The climate has proved to be both friend and foe to every person who has lived along that coast. The winters are long and dreary. Rain and fog cover the low-lying landscape for months at a time. A cold wetness permeates the stoutest covering. The meadows can become seas of mud. Winters are often a succession of terrible storms, breaking dikes and overwhelming the work of decades and generations... The wind is ever-present and powerful in ways that only sailors and inhabitants of the Great Plains can understand. No great woods, no quiet valleys exist. Instead, there is a feeling of unlimited space and open skies...

Nonetheless, the area did incorporate some rich farmland, and in the springs and summers ""the meadows and marshes blossomed forth in magnificent abundance"" that made the little territory covetable to some. According to Urban, Dithmarschen owed its independence largely to a power vacuum that emerged in the district as a result of the severe defeat of the Danish King Valdemar the Conqueror at the Battle of Bornhöved in July 1227 – a loss apparently occasioned by the precipitous retreat of a contingent of Dithmarscher infantry which was supposed to be covering the king's cavalry. Whatever their culpability in the matter, the local peasants put the disaster to good use, reaching an agreement with the Archbishop of Hamburg which involved them recognising him as their lord without actually conceding effective sovereignty, retaining, as a result, ""such autonomy as to be practically self-governing."" The Dithmarschers subsequently built their own *dom*, or cathedral, in the small town of Meldorp, and this building became, after about 1300, the seat of their quasi-independent peasant government.

Broadly, Urban argues, Dithmarschen was a clan-based society which owed its effective independence to a combination of ongoing chaos in the Holy Roman Empire, which prevented serious steps being taken to curtail the minor irritation caused by the existence of a small community of independent-minded peasants living in a hard-to-get-at marsh, and an obscure victory won by its peasant clans over the local petty nobility as a result of the so-called Rabbit War of 1289.

To take the external developments first: once the Danish border had been pushed north in 1227, the main temporal rulers in the area were the counts of Holstein. Their territory was broken up and divided between sons on two separate occasions, in 1263 and 1290, weakening what was left of the county to the point where it had no real ability to impose itself militarily on its neighbours. For his part, meanwhile, the bishop of Hamburg devoted most of his resources to attempting to improve his tax base by bringing the much richer peasants living south of the Elbe under his control. Dithmarschen took advantage of this situation, paying ""a small contribution"" to the archbishop every year, and studiously refraining from provoking him into serious military action in return ""for guarantees that they would be permitted to practice the self-government they believed to be essential to their way of life."" After 1329, the taxes owed to Hamburg amounted to no more than a one-off payment of 500 marks made by the Dithmarschers to each new bishop at the time of his election, ""after which they would wish him a long life and have almost no other obligations."" In the same period, the peasants of Dithmarschen established a long-lasting informal alliance with the Hanseatic port of Lübeck, across the Jutland peninsula to their east, which over the next two centuries provided them with both an outlet for surplus goods and a source of imports – not least weaponry. The presence of other small independent polities nearby, by the way, is a reminder not only that the Holy Roman Empire in this period comprised dozens, and eventually hundreds, of political units, among which it was almost always possible to find allies to band together with against common enemies, but also that Dithmarschen itself was not nearly so anomalous an entity, nor so threatening to the contemporary political order, as it might have been had it existed inside a more centralised state such as England – a factor that doubtless helps to explain the republic's considerable longevity.

Within Dithmarschen, meanwhile, political power continued to reside in the hands of a class of petty nobles, the ""serf-knights"" (*ministeriale*), most of whom had risen from the ranks of the more well-to-do local peasantry themselves. These men held most of the administrative positions within Ditchmarschen, but lacked the right to claim hereditary control over these offices. In the aftermath of the Rabbit War, most of the members of this group were forced into exile in Holstein (c.1290), while others chose to stay in the district and form their own clan, the Vodiemannen (literally ""advocates""), and were absorbed into the local peasant society. From then on, according to Urban and F.C. Dahlmann, Ditchmarschen's government comprised an annual assembly of elders and clan chiefs, which met at Meldorp once a year ""to make laws for the entire land."" Because these meetings were short, and focused largely on the urgent practicalities of dike-building and maintenance, and because there were well over 100 rival clans within the marshlands, it was almost impossible to pass comprehensive packages of legislation, and although a written constitution did gradually emerge (it is this, Urban argues, that gives Dithmarschen its claim to be considered a genuinely independent polity), no one clan could dominate even at a parish level without causing an alliance of rival families to form against it. The result was that the average Dithmarscher parish was in most respects independent from its neighbours, and the average peasant living in one of those parishes was a free man who farmed his own land and lived a life about as close to that of the ""anarcho-syndicalist peasant"" of *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* as any did in Europe, joining together with his neighbours only to resist the infrequent military incursions launched against Dithmarschen by its neighbours."
"There's no standard way to do it. Typically we download everything and read it over. If you are really serious about the research, you try to categorize it one way or another so that it becomes more usable. There are many different ways to do this, ranging from the very high-tech to the very low-tech, and the differences will depend on the historian, their goals, sometimes their methods (some historians are into computational analysis of texts, but most are not). Some involve hiring undergraduates to do the most boring and mindless work for you. :-)"
"> The song doesn't describe the ballerinas as being popular, or looking down on the skaters because they are losers.

"Just to add on to my answer from there, the decision to translate names like ""Pierre"" is sort of a cultural decision that we make as a society - in the past we most definitely did translate pyotr and pierre as Peter, (Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, etc) and we have William the Conqueror, not Guillaume (sp?) the conqueror."
">And one could postulate meta-narratives of decline, based, for example, on the lingering effects of the Antonine Plague (which probably swept through all four empire in the late second century), or on some climatic aberration in central Asia. But even if such a link could be proven, the declines of all four empires would have to be understood on their own terms.

I completely agree with this.

That being said, one of the first things taught in post-secondary Chinese history is that the rise and fall of dynasties can be matched fairly neatly to rise and fall of average temperature in Northern China, including this one. And there's been strong evidence of famine's relation to war, both as a cause and a consequence, during the Sengoku.

I don't want to end up just dismissing these events as due to climate change, and I totally agree the political and socio-economic factors all very likely played a large part in causing the chaos, and these need to be examined and understood. And of course global temperature systems are complicated to the timing and effect on each area wouldn't sync up perfectly with each other. Such climate events might not even have caused the initial problem, but maybe just exasperated problems to the point that an already shaky government couldn't handle it.

Having said that, like in Chinese history, according to [Climate Change during and after the Roman Empire: Reconstructing the Past from Scientific and Historical Evidence](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/JINH_a_00379), temperature, precipitation, and volcanic activity models seem to also *roughly* match the rise of the Empire, the Third Century Crisis, the recovery, and then Rome's fall.

So my question is, is there a candidate for the cause of ""climatic aberration"" that might have put pressure on the Eurasian empires?

EDIT: Just running around on Wikipedia, and the [Hatepe eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatepe_eruption) seem to potentially match the weather event in terms of date and eruption size. Is there research into examining this eruption or other eruptions and the effects on temperature?

EDIT2: [The Ksudach](https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=300050) also seem to have erupted in this time period."
It's absolutely wrong. I was going for sarcasm. The Civil War was fought over slavery. I've edited the answer to make that clear; thanks for the heads up that it wasn't!
"Writing as a geneticist and not an historian, you are correct in your reading of the original paper. We often discuss this paper as an example of how science can take on a (wrong-headed) life of its own in the popular imagination. The boring truth of the matter is--as you rightly point out--there is absolutely no evidence upon which we can conclude that the maker in question originated with Genghis Khan himself, and only marginal evidence to indicate that the marker was not relatively common during the lifetime of Genghis Khan. The authors state the former caveat explicitly in at least two places in the original paper, and the later claim requires more examination in light of anthropological evidence.

And it's this last claim that it really the paper's weak point and probably why the misconception is allowed to persist. Specifically, the authors conclude that this genetic marker is likely indicative of social stratification within the Mongols:

>Our findings nevertheless demonstrate a novel form of selection in human populations on the basis of social prestige. 

However, this sort of speculation is only that and it occurs in the part of the paper (the discussion section) that is  the least objective and the most speculative. Importantly, none of the authors are historians, nor does the study's acknowledgments section indicate that any historians or anthropologists were even consulted. Therefore, we are left with an interpretation of the genetics (which the authors are qualified to do) within the context of medieval Mongol culture (which they are likely not qualified to do). So to reiterate, the only true take away from the original paper is that we have strong evidence for the presence of a genetic marker that is both present within the male lineage of Genghis Khan that is also shared by millions of modern Asians.  We do not have strong evidence to support any claim that that marker was somehow private to Genghis Khan or even to his immediate male relatives."

"I have written a few answers on Richard’s fluctuating reputation, which you can read [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gb53j6/king_john_seems_to_be_universally_viewed_as_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/h13thy/why_is_richard_lionheart_so_revered_and_king_john/). 

I will preface my own answer by stating that I am in some disagreement with u/J-Force’s own assessment of Richard, which will be evident throughout. I am not writing a direct rebuttal, so I have opted to post this as a top-level comment. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, I am limited in my access to primary sources. 

I want to also begin by pointing out that the words “good” and “bad” can be a problem in this type of analysis because they carry a moral connotation. When I am judging Richard and John in particular, I try not to look at them through the lens of good and bad so much as “successful” and “unsuccessful”. Obviously we know now in 2020 that embarking on a violent war of religion is bad, but in the 1190’s, it was the expectation of successful kingship. 

Richard was controversial in his own time, and contemporary assessment of him often depends on whether they were written before or after he had become King. For example, Roger of Howden and Gervase of Canterbury both write about Richard as a cruel and tyrannical ruler of Aquitaine during 1182-3. During this period, Richard was being attacked by his elder brother, Henry the Young King, who was expected to succeed their father, Henry II, as King of England. However, Henry the Young King died of dysentery in June 1183 and Richard became heir to England, Normandy and Anjou. At least Roger of Howden is known to have revised his work to characterize Richard as the victim in these passages sometime after Richard became King. While we cannot absolutely determine which interpretation is accurate, it is likely that both versions include a certain amount of political spin. 

Richard did have a reputation for terseness, but also one for wit and humor when it suited him. One muslim writer describes him speaking in a tone that seemed half-serious, and half-joking. While imprisoned in Germany, Richard was made to endure a show trial, in which he defended himself ably. Even William the Breton, a chronicler of Richard’s great rival expressed admiration. He was a songwriter, and was acknowledged by both Angevin and Capetian chroniclers for his generosity, or at least that he paid more than Philip II of France. 

However, as I have said, Richard displayed this qualities only when it suited him. He was also known to be arrogant, and certainly made his share of political blunders. The worst was certainly his handling of the situation with Leopold of Austria. After taking the city of Acre, Richard and Philip II of France both flew their banners above the city (they had made an agreement to share the spoils equally between them). When Leopold flew his banner above the city as well, Richard ordered it removed. This created a grudge that eventually led to Richard’s imprisonment in the Holy Roman Empire, for which Leopold and Emperor Henry both received consequences from the Pope. Leopold was actually ordered to repay the ransom. [Though whether or not it was actually paid is anyone’s guess. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ezld7p/richard_i_of_england_paid_a_huge_ransom_to_the/)

Another of Richard’s blunders was in his promotion of William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely as Chancellor while he was away on Crusade. Longchamp was deeply unpopular, owing to his lack of tact and his disputes with Richard’s brothers John and Geoffrey FitzRoy. However, on the whole, Richard’s biographers praise his delegation of authority in England. John Gillingham, in analyzing Richard’s tax policy does acknowledge that Richard’s taxation was harsher than that of his father, but also that far fewer complaints survive about Richard’s taxes than his father’s. Gillingham interprets this to mean that Richard’s policies were either considered worth the heavier taxes, or that he was simply more persuasive towards his own point of view. 

One of the most common, modern criticisms of Richard as King of England is the short amount of time her spent in England, as well as the fact that he did not speak English. The fact of the matter is that Richard maintained a good relationship with KIng William of Scotland, so England suffered not threat of invasion. England’s administration had also been polished and tightened by Richard’s father, so it could function effectively without the King’s immediate interference. In fact, Richard’s predecessors, William I (great-great grandfather), Henry I (great-grandfather), and Henry II (father) also spent long stretches out of England, as they were often more concerned with their French possessions, which were considered more valuable and prestigious at the time. None of them spoke English either, as far as we know. Instead, Richard focused his boundless energy where his skills and immediate threats to his patrimony demanded, which was to be in France. 

Arguably, Richard’s worst mistake was his handling of the succession. Though out his reign, he had considered his nephews, Arthur of Brittany and Otto of Saxony as heirs, as well as his brother John, who he eventually confirmed as heir on his deathbed. This left questions in the succession, and John’s early reign was marked by conflicts with Arthur of Brittany, who was backed by an opportunistic Philip II. Had Richard left a direct heir, this crisis may have been averted. We do not know why Richard did not have an heir with Berengaria of Navarre, and without her side of the story, we probably never will. Certainly Richard was ordered to be more faithful towards her, indicating that he at least bears some responsibility for the failure of the marriage. 

This brings us to the history of the perception of Richard. Certainly throughout the Middle Ages, he was held up as the gold standard for Kingship. u/J-Force is not wrong to suggest that there was some element of nostalgia for the ‘glory days’ of Richard I’s reign. He was arguably able to sustain the successes of Henry II’s consolidation of the Angevin ‘Empire’ and his reputation as a warrior certainly played to how intertwined warfare was with Medieval ideals of Kingship. Kings were, until the throne passed to Mary I, almost universally depicted on seals and coinage, engaged in mounted combat on one side, and seated as the bringer-of-justice on the other. In addition to maintaining law and just rule within their lands, and defending the Church, it was a major expectation that medieval Kings be actively engaged in either the defense or expansion of their realms, and preferably the latter. 

Obviously, this opinion drastically changed with changes to popular perceptions of the role of Kingship. By the 19th Century, where we see popular opinion of Richard veer drastically towards the “bad son, bad husband, bad king” approach. This is where most of the modern criticisms of Richard come from. This was a period of English hegemony, and I suspect that English historians of the time found the very idea of an English King not devoting the majority of his time to England reprehensible. Therefore we get the mythos of Richard as the compulsive warmonger, ignorant of English affairs, and with little care for the island realm. This mythos continued alongside a tradition of Richard as literary hero (largely perpetuated by Sir Walter Scott), which creates an often confusing historiographic landscape today. 

In my other answers, which focused more on John, I explain how the two brothers’ reputations have evolved in opposition to each other. Modern scholarship of both is more nuanced. Richard’s main biographers, John Gillingham and Ralph Turner (with Richard Heiser) are both positive towards Richard, but are able to accept his faults as a ruler. Likewise, John’s biographers are able to put themselves past the Evil Prince from the Robin Hood stories to find a character who was deeply flawed, but not evil. 

I hope my slightly conflicting alternate answer helps broaden our collective understanding. I hesitated posting this because of the time, but thought it would be an interesting insight for AH readers into how history is made.

">and if you look at the propaganda material generated (like Machen's ""The Bowmen"") there is a largely romantic callback to the image of the medieval knight as an icon of martial spirit and nobility

Where *The Bowmen* is concerned, rather than the medieval knight, isn't the callback more to the romantic ideal of the longbow wielding yeoman of Merrie England? An image of the egalitarian Freeborn Englishman^tm against the grey, faceless Hun?

*Halloa Sweet Saint George! A long bow and a strong bow!*

When looking at this sort of propaganda (Chesterton's *St Barbara* is another good example), I'm struck by how the trappings of Western Catholicism seem to be deliberately (and somewhat absurdly to the modern reader) be cast against the almost sterile robotic German  soldiers of propaganda.

"I am sure that somewhere, a historian of Scandinavia is feverishly writing an answer on the history of Norwegian democracy, Norwegian checks and balances, and their role in guaranteeing the effective management of the Norwegian pension fund. In the meantime, I think it might be useful to think of this question from the perspective of histories of institutions. Can this question be approached by trying to understand why some institutions lead to comparatively better outcomes and other institutions have comparatively worse outcomes? 

While the short answer to the question is, “Not really and it leads to a lot of arguing” (we are, effectively, working with counterfactuals, which is a very difficult thing to do) those who have tried generally come to similar conclusions: Good institutions will succeed, bad institutions will not succeed. Norway, we can safely say, has effective institutions: Not just its pension funds, but its system of government, social safety net, and relations between key stakeholders like workers, private enterprise, and political as well as non-political associations. This means Norway would probably still be a prosperous country even without its natural resources, even though its economy would be very different. We can make direct comparisons: Sweden, Denmark, and even Finland, who have similar institutional setups and backgrounds to Norway (minus the oil-fueled pension fund) are similarly prosperous countries by western european standards (of course, they like all countries are beset with complicated histories and their own modern problems, but in general terms I think we can agree they these are prosperous countries with successful institutions). 

Conversely, countries which are rich in natural resources but are not prosperous are instead often plagued by poor institutions. In other words, in all probability no amount of natural resources would be able to compensate for their institutional shortcomings.

This idea is called “Institutional Development Theory,” and while it’s not exactly a detailed formula that explains everything, it’s the best consensus that academia has come up with. 

You might be interested in [this related discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5f5su8/why_did_western_europe_develop_at_a_faster_pace/dahugtr/) on economic development that I participated in a few years ago, which might shed some light on what generally constitute successful institutions and how they contribute to economic success."

"Though Africa is the proper Latin term, classical Roman authors frequently used Libya in this sense as well, particularly in poetry. So when Lucan, like Sallust, gives a description of the Africa in the world in book 9 of his *Civil War*, he explains that:

>>The third part of the world is Libya, if you want to trust in rumour altogether; but, if you go by winds and sky, it will be a part of Europe. For Nile's shores are not more distant than Scythian Tanais from furthest Gades, the point where Europe runs away from Libya and by their curve the shores have made a place for Ocean; but the greater region goes to make up only Asia.

> tertia pars rerum Libye, si credere famae

>cuncta uelis; at, si uentos caelumque sequaris,

>pars erit Europae. nec enim plus litora Nili

>quam Scythicus Tanais primis a Gadibus absunt,

>unde Europa fugit Libyen et litora flexu                   

>Oceano fecere locum; sed maior in unam

>orbis abit Asiam. (9.411-17)

It is likewise favoured by Virgil in the Aeneid (eg. 1.22, 384, etc.), surely as a result of its Greek roots. A point which Pliny (*Nat. Hist.* 5.1) also notes:

>> The Greeks have given the name of Libya to Africa, and have called the sea that lies in front of it the Libyan Sea. 

>africam graeci libyam appellavere et mare ante eam libycum

This use of both terms continues through Latin literature into late antiquity. And while Africa is normally preferred, Libya continues to be used relatively commonly. For example, while you highlight Isidore's use of Africa in his tripartite formula in 14.2.1, in his geography of Africa in 14.5, he actually forefronts Libya:

>>Libya (*Libya*) is so called because the Libs, the African wind, blows from there. Others say that Epaphus, the son of Jupiter and founder of Memphis in Egypt, had a daughter named Libya with his wife Cassiopeia, and Libya afterwards established a kingdom in Africa. From her name the land Libya received its name. Further, there are those who think that Africa (*Africa*) is named as though the word were *aprica* (“exposed to the sun”), because it is open to the sky and the sun and without bitter cold. Others say Africa is named from one of the descendants of Abraham and Keturah, who was called Afer (i.e. Epher), of whom we made mention above.
 
>Libya dicta quod inde Libs flat, hoc est Africus. Alii aiunt Epaphum Iovis filium, qui Memphin in Aegypto condidit, ex Cassiopa uxore procreasse filiam Libyam, quae postea in Africa regnum possedit. Cuius ex nomine terra Libya est appellata. Africam autem nominatam quidam inde existimant, quasi apricam, quod sit aperta caelo vel soli et sine horrore frigoris. Alii dicunt Africam appellari ab uno ex posteris Abrahae de Cethura, qui vocatus est Afer, de quo supra meminimus. (14.5.1-2)

But more significantly, to the OP's question, while Africa is considered a region of Africa in the Roman period, Libya is *also* the name for a region of Africa in roman geography. Specifically, it is the same region (roughly) as modern Libya, the first province of Africa after crossing the border from Egypt.

So Pliny finishes his description of Africa with Libya, explaining that:

>>The region that follows is called Libya Mareotis, and borders upon Egypt...

>Quae sequitur regio Mareotis Libya appellatur, Aegypto contermina. (5.6)

This is distinct from the province of Africa, which is further to the west (around Carthage and modern Tunisia):

>> Beyond the river Tusca begins the region of Zeugitana, and that part which properly bears the name of Africa.

>A Tusca Zeugitana regio et quae proprie vocetur Africa est. (5.4)

However, importantly for the dominant trends in the Middle Ages, the major geographies of late antiquity tend to maintain the province of Libya but omit the province of Africa, using instead one of the subregions. So Isidore lists the African provinces as: '**Libya Cyrenensis**, Pentapolis, Tripolis, **Byzacium, Carthage, Numidia**, Mauretania Sitifensis, Mauretania Tingitana, and Ethiopia', similarly Orosius gives: **Libya Cyrenaica et Pentapolis**, Tripolitana, **Byzacium Zeugis et Numidia**, Sitifensis et Caesariensis Mauretania and Tingitana Mauretania.

Although this image of Isidore and Orosius remains dominant through much of the middle ages, although the ambiguities here continue to pop up. To give just two examples. First in his (frankly rather unusual) geographical text, the *Descriptio Mappae Mundi* (c.1130-5) Hugh of Saint Victor explains that: 


>> it should be known that authors sometimes use Libya for Africa, and Africa for Libya, but they also use Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya and Africa indifferently for the southern region of the world.

> ... sciendum quod scriptores aliquando Libiam pro Affrica, et Affricam pro Libia ponunt, sed et Ethiopiam, Egyptum, Libiam, Affricam pro meridiana plaga indifferenter ponunt. (18)

Likewise, in this text, Hugh resurrects the ambiguity in terms of provinces as well, describing the three major regions of Africa as: Ethiopia, Egypt (!?!?!?), Libya, and Carthaginian Africa (*Affricam Carthaginensem*).

The second weird example is the St Sever Beatus map ([Paris, BNF, Lat. 8878, 45bis^r-v](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52505441p/f104.image.r=latin%208878)). The Beatus maps were a collection of slightly strange maps that were attached to a commentary on the Book of Revelation, originally written by an 8th century Spanish Monk, Beatus of Liébana. There are about a dozen or so copies of this commentary with maps, from the 9th through the 13th century. These are generally a bit idiosyncratic when compared with other maps in the middle ages, and one such idiosyncratic feature is that they tend to label the third region Libya rather than Africa and to distinguish this clearly from Ethiopia. Anyways, one particular the 11th century copy from St Sever in France (hence St Sever Beatus) is perhaps the most like a detailed 'mappaemundi' of the later middle ages. Weirdly, on this map in particular, the region of the world has been labelled 'Libia' with 'Africa' running across that label. It seems to me that this is meant to label the major subsection of that region (corresponding to the correct province), but it may also represent a simple ambiguity around the name of the region. 

But as I say, these are very much exceptions, among medieval geographies, Libya is normally a province and Africa is normally the region, almost certainly as a result of this prominent arrangement in the major geographical textbooks of late antiquity that continued to found geographical education up to at least the high middle ages."

"The decline of both economies should be explained by a convention of economic, political and social factors. In history and economic history this process has been explained in general terms for this economies and also some other Latin American countries (Uruguay, Brazil).

The economic factors that can explain the decline are mainly the dependance of this economies on commodities. One thing that commodities have in common (meat for Argentina and oil for Venezuela) is that their prices fluctuate a a lot, which makes you really dependent on the international price of you exports. According to the Prebisch-Singer theory, this dependence will lead to deterioration on the terms of trade (on the long run what they produce will have a lower relative price to what they import), which leads to stagnation on the growth rate. Furthermore, commodities have (though in my opinion nowadays this is really debatable) low added technology, so also very low added value.
Added to this structural problem, in many cases very poor economic policies were applied -although in my opinion this is not the main factor.

From the political and institutional view, most Latin American countries had unstable institutions and political systems which certainly didn't help. In most cases private property didn't have the security it had in rich countries. Add to this some North American intervention in the late '60s and '70s and you have the worst institutional framework imaginable. One of the countries that had stronger political institutions was Uruguay.

From the social view, it should be noted that Latin American societies were (and still are) really inequitable in their distribution. Hand in hand with this, most countries didn't have the human resources that rich countries had. Also, the educated people many times migrated -tendency that was even more notorious in the dictatorial period.
And now, to answer your question. With all this structural factors, in the '40s and even more in the '50s, this economies had from one hand really good international prices for their exports (WWII and Korean war really helped); and from the other, they were applying a development agenda influenced by the ECLAD. In the late '50s the international context wasn't so favorable as it had been. Governments in this periods had large deficits which weren't much of a concern when prices were good, but when prices went down, strong fiscal adjustments measures were put in place. From the development model, it varied from country to country, but in general terms a really faulty application of the theory was the norm. Things like excessive protectionism, artificial exchange rates and corruption were very common.

The decline started in most countries by the late '50s and continued at least up to the 2000s. The ISI model was abandoned throughout the '70s, and in the '90s economies had shifted towards hard neoliberalism (which is the exact opposite of the ISI model). 

To sum up, the divergence in GDP per capita between  Western Europe and North American was mainly due to what each of them export and how they produce it (added some institutional, political and social factors). While in the developed countries they produced high tech goods (then cars now IT, tu put it grossly) which have more technology and human resources added (therefore much more productivity per worker); Latin American countries produced commodities and some industrial goods thanks to protectionism, they only exported commodities (on which the latter depended on the former being exported at good prices). Economies that export commodities are less prone to have technological advancements and added human resources, which are the main factors that lead to more productivity.

I hope this explanation can at least put a light into what happened. You should know that in economic history (like in all social sciences) the points I've just made are really debatable, and even I do not agree with all of them, I used this theory (the ECLAD theory of dependence in its contemporary form) because I find it to be the one that can explain it better in a complexity that is appropriate for a Reddit post ha ha. What I really can't stand is when such complex process is reduced to bad policy and corruption. In my opinion -although corruption and bad policy were not helpful and can explain some part of the process-  that's an extremely simplistic view. The decline should be explained mainly by the structural problems this economies had (and, though very different from that period, still have).

Thank you for taking the time to write this out.  I'm more educated today because of you.
"Wow, longtime lurker and I can *finally* answer something! Fingers crossed I cited enough for the mods.

As is often the case with fashion, how a particular trend came to be a cornerstone relies on several reinforcements over time. Although I'm certain there are even more reinforcements I'm not aware of, let's focus on how the 70s, 80s, and 90s reinforced tracksuit love in different ways.

*First let's take a stroll down memory lane with general clothing production issues in the 1970s:*

Although the USSR had subsidies for children's clothes, adult clothes were largely difficult and expensive to buy^(1) due to limitations of in-state producers and artisans coupled with the obvious ban on imported consumer goods. Two-thirds of an average worker's wages would have been devoted to food and clothing with the latter being scarce as the USSR focused on investment over production. The USSR tried to confront the issue several times after the population failed to make their own clothing as initially recommended. In a decade's time (mid-1960s to mid-1970s) clothing production had increased by 2.5x, however the demand was still far higher than the production.^(2) 

Just because you lived in the USSR did not mean brand name was meaningless to you. We can see this with the incredibly popular Levi jeans which would have cost you about 200 rubles ($270 USD).^(3) Despite this price point and difficulty in buying an American brand, Levis were seen in the USSR fashion especially that of youths. Any foreign brand name you wanted would be very expensive *if* you could get it. Even if you don't care about brands another thing to consider is that most of the USSR is *quite* cold meaning you would need heavy (expensive) winter clothes. So how do people keep their expensive and hard to find clothes nice? The way that many societies have throughout time - house clothes. At home women would have changed into an outfit consisting of a simple dress and for men it would have been what we think of as track clothes today (a sweatshirt and loose pants).

*Oh, how I love old memories, but if we were to pop in a tv-recorded VHS from 1980 we might see a fraction of a big event many countries boycotted:* The 1980 Olympics in Moscow. Clothing was still in high demand and production was not at a pre-soviet level, but obviously the home team needed to look sharp. You would have to recognize it by its iconic stripes because the USSR's team stripped the logos right off the German-made Adidas tracksuits they donned.^(4) These Olympic tracksuits had a clear impact on Soviet fashion trends, but only insomuch as any Olympic event would have on the host country.

*Ring, ring, ring... what's that? The 90s just called and let me know that jogging is cool now.* That's right - up until the late 80s/early 90s jogging for exercise was not that common. As it became popular as a hobby so did fashion surrounding jogging which of course included tracksuits. This new style of athletic clothes for the average person became popular worldwide and just like with denim in the 70s - Soviets wanted it. Similar to the example of Levis in the 70s, name brand athletic clothes also would have been incredibly expensive. So expensive, in fact, they become a status symbol and who loves status more than gangsters? 

Although the USSR had ""fallen,"" the black market created by rising demand and stifling production lived on giving plenty of opportunities for a gopnik to make a dime. And what does a gopnik wear you might ask? Only the finest brand name clothes which naturally includes the coveted adidas tracksuit.^(5) 

So now we have a fashion that grew from the necessity of comfy and cheap house clothes and then became mainstream through athletics. Many soviets would have grown up wearing house clothes and associating them with comfort and home, once that fashion became a status symbol all bets were off. Who doesn't want to be comfortable and look expensive?

"So thorough, cohesive, illuminating, and easy to comprehend. You're doing everyone who reads it a service. Thank you very much."
"These are all good questions!

The royal roads were imperial endeavors - but that doesn't mean they were all constructed out of whole cloth (er, stone). Many roads in the heartland of the empire appear to have renovated and re-utilized roads from previous states - especially around the Titicaca Basin, where the Tiwanaku (a cult state of whom the Incas considered themselves the inheritors, at least in their architectural achievements) had constructed roads around something like half of the Basin. The Incas completed the loop, but expanded the existing portion. Other roads go right through old Wari centers like Pikillacta.

However, there's far from only one way to get around in much of the highlands especially. Roads between communities would often be present alongside or at some distance from the royal road - these wouldn't be stone-lined or super fancy, but if you're traveling with goods to bring to a neighbor, or herding your llamas to some pasture up the way, odds are you won't need anything fancy.

This really reasserts the royal road's, well, royalty - you didn't have much need of using the road unless you were on imperial business. You could obtain a permit to use the road, but that often meant some kind of imperial dispensation (fulfilling your mita, or else being conscripted into a military campaign). Traveling on it without the appropriate authority was strictly enforced - highwaymen caught robbing people were executed by local authorities under Inca suzerainty. This could mean steep physical penalties for using it, even if it was not for ill ends."
Absolutely stellar answer. Thank you.

"Sure it does. If the colonizer government's project is to eradicate native Americans from the land -- as it was -- then it's extremely difficult to view that as anything other than theft of land, carried out via the state apparatus. u/nilhaus above explains this in the context of just war theory, which is a way of looking at it that's rooted in European law (as, to be fair, is the formal definition of genocide). From the indigenous perspective, a long record of forced dispossession from land, broken treaties, starvation, sterilization, theft of children, and a national project to eradicate languages ... seems like theft.

"Yes, there definitely is an impact in the decline of the political machines, and I wouldn't want too leave the impression that the above is mono-causal. I touch a little bit on the decline in the non-Southern states related to other factors, and one I don't delve into outside the South is how the massive fraud that institutions like Tammany Hall perpetuated in the 19th century became harder to do with the rise of the Australian ballot such such; voting used to be *public*, as I write about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9qjfjm/in_the_united_states_we_have_to_register_to/e8ar8pj/), and it is harder to round up votes the way they did once it goes private. But alas, my knowledge is much more Southern in focus, so changing patterns in the northern cities like NY and Chicago is something I would leave to another to expand on, as I can only talk in the broadest terms of ""Yes, its a factor!"", and voters who they once were incentivized to mobilize as 'their' voters, they now.... didn't really want voting if they couldn't control them."

"I'd say Norm Peterson is a Henny Youngman-type, so doesn't quite count in the same category. (His real name is Henry, so you're ok with either Henny or Henry.)

Henny Youngman is the comedian most famous for the line ""take my wife ... please"" and did a blizzard of one-liners about his wife. He was also married for 59 years and his wife often traveled with him. In other words, his wife was in on the joke.

I don't know what season you're on, but Norm's wife does show up at one point in the 5th season, although you don't see her face because it is hit by a pie. Norm is played by George Wendt; Norm's wife is played by the real life wife of George Wendt (Bernadette Birkett).

You could argue there's still some sort of issue with it, but it's still much different than a couple bickering in person.

There's no biography of Henny Youngman but he has an autobiography from 1992, *Take My Life, Please!*"
"In the judgment of the poem itself, Odysseus preserves the truth of his marriage to Penelope. However, there seems to be some concern to make that very clear.

When Odysseus returns home, famously, his dog Argos recognizes him immediately, is overjoyed, and can finally die at peace because he has seen his master return. That's all Argos needs. However, Penelope demands proof. Odysseus instructs his son:

> ""Telemachus, leave your mother to put me to the proof here in our home. She will soon come to look at me in a different light.""

While Odysseus has Telemachus then distract their neighbors with a ruse that makes them think very badly of Penelope (WELL DONE, ODDS), he gets a head-to-toe divinely-powered Boost Up. The housekeeper *and* Athena refresh him inch by inch:

> Meanwhile the lion-hearted Odysseus, in his own home again, was bathed and rubbed with oil by the housekeeper Eurynome, and clothed by her in a beautiful cloak and tunic. Then Athene enhanced his comeliness from head to foot. She made him look taller and sturdier, and she caused the bushy locks to hang from his head thick as the petals of a hyacinth in bloom. Just as a craftsman trained by Hephaestus and herself in the secrets of his art takes pains to put a graceful finish to his work by overlaying silver-ware with gold, she endowed his head and shoulders with an added beauty. He came out from the bath looking like one of the everlasting gods.

Penelope's real test, however, is to casually imply that their marriage bed, which Odysseus made, is in a different location. Odysseus catches the ploy immediately and squelches it right back down, confirming his identity for once and for all. Modern scholars have probably written more about that bed as a symbol of Penelope and Odysseus' secure relationship than articles have been written about *entire people* in my dissertation. Put together.

So in contrast to Argos *recognizing* Odysseus immediately and that's good as golden, before we can see the marriage reconnected for sure, a goddess must renew Odysseus and he must prove he is who he says.

The poem itself doesn't end up doubting that Odysseus was a true husband, but it seems almost suspiciously eager to ensure that the reader does not, either."
"Fantastic response, thanks for taking the time to write that!

"OP, I just wanted to comment on this part:

> Right off the bat, it seems like shorter life spans would significantly alter what it means to be ""young"".


Life expectancy is an average. Treat it like that. It did not mean that people grew older faster and that by age, say, 40, you were a senior. It means there were many more reasons to die young.

Infant mortality was especially high, bringing the average down. Then, when you were adult, there were more reasons to die young than today, such as lack of nutrition, illnesses, warfare etc.

But in the case of a rich, urban roman such as Gaius Octavius, if he made it out of infant years he could expect to live quite old... Gaius Octavius himself died at the ripe age of 75, and his successor Tiberius lived to be 77."
"Fascinating, thank you"
"First some background on the political environment at the end of the Eighteenth Century: The actual Illuminati was a group derived from a power struggle among Freemasons in Bavaria in the 1770s. The members of the Illuminati desired to move their Masonic brethren toward the Radical Enlightenment, which promoted democracy, egalitarianism, and spinozist materialism. The Radical Enlightenment was largely unsuccessful in Germany, but radicals did find success in France. The increasingly extreme French revolutionary ideology under the Jacobins made the term “Jacobin” a pejorative throughout Europe and America. Radicals existed elsewhere including the infant United States and Great Britain. Anyone supporting democratic ideas were labeled as Jacobins, and assumed to really want anarchy and atheism.

Conspiracy theories involving the Illuminati became popular in the 1790s. It was in response to the French Revolution. Conservatives, particularly in Britain, used Robespierre’s Reign of Terror to scare the people from considering democratic reform or revolution. Part of their counter-revolutionary argument was a religious appeal. They argued the French revolutionaries dismantling the Catholic Church was fundamentally atheist and even demonic. The Thermidorian Reaction and the French Directory reigned back the revolution, but the conservatives still needed a boogeyman to maintain the fear in the common folk. In 1798, Augustin Barruel, a French Jesuit who had fled to Britain, wrote *Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism*, which described an elaborate conspiracy of several Radical Enlightenment organizations attempting to demolish Western Civilization as they knew it and replace it with a new world order. At the same time, John Robison mirrored Barruel’s assertions with his *Proofs of a Conspiracy Against all the Religions and Governments of Europe*. Also occurring at this time, was the Irish Rebellion which was instigated by the United Irishmen, another secretive organization. Initially, these theories were not taken seriously. The Anti-Jacobin, the most prominent counter-revolutionary periodical in Britain at the time, was dismissive of them. However, only a year later *The Anti-Jacobin Review* (which had succeeded the original *Anti-Jacobin*) was more willing to reference Barruel and Robison. The conspiracy theories became more elaborate to include the Knights Templar and the Occult. Demonic imagery was already being used with the Jacobins so it wasn’t that big of a leap.

I do not know much about the growth of the Illuminati conspiracy theories through the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century, but Eighteenth-Century British propaganda was extremely effective and lasted in our collective cultural memory.

"Portuguese here, as soon as I saw that quote I thought it was bollocks but I'm no expert. So thank you for the write up. I gave you one of those free awards reddit gives you (worthless but still). 

Anyway, as a follow up question I was wondering, which factors made the Iberian Peninsula take so long for the Roman armies to fully conquer? Especially when compared to other more established and more militarily developed areas."
"I want to add to this that the comment in question neglects the role of Rome's allies (*Socii* is the term during the Republic) in Rome's wars. These non-Romans made up about half (estimates vary) of Rome's military capacity during all phases of the Republic, until the Social War of 91-88, when Rome incorporated all cities in Italy into the Roman citizenship.

For these soldiers, fighting *was* an obligation, imposed by Rome through treaties that were often established through military defeat.  Polybius tells us these soldiers were paid less and fed worse than their Roman counterparts, while during the course of the 2nd and 1st centuries Rome relied increasingly on Italian manpower.  The Italian cities had no input into Roman foreign policy, and saw little of the rewards of that policy.

The Socii's dissatisfaction with these alliances made itself into Rome's foundation narrative.  Livy narrates how Alba Longa, ostensibly a Roman ally, defected to support Veii.

The Italian aims in the Social War are obscure, and there are several theories about the cause and objectives of the Italians in that war, but one contributing factor seems to be their exclusion from foreign policy decisions.  Returning to the Alban episode, Livy has Mettius Fufetius relate the Albans' reasons for war:
>Our king Cluilius... told me... that we were about to fight over **a matter of brigandage and the refusal to restore stolen property...** If, however, we let specious arguments go and tell each other the truth, we should admit that our two nations... have a deeper reason for going to war: I mean, ambition and the love of power.... **we are about to gamble for empire or slavery....**

That argument is exactly the argument put forth by the only rhetoric we have left from either side in the Social War in the *Rhetorica ad Herennium*:
>
When they [the *Socii*] had resolved to fight against us [the Romans], on what, I ask you, did they rely in presuming to undertake the war, since they understood that much the greater part of our allies remained faithful to duty, and since they saw that they had at hand no great supply of soldiers, no competent commanders, and no public money — in short, none of the things needful for carrying on the war? Even if they were waging war with neighbours on a **question of boundaries**, even if in their opinion one battle would decide the contest, they would yet come to the task in every way better prepared and equipped than they are now. It is still less credible that with such meagre forces they would attempt to **usurp that sovereignty over the whole world** which all the civilized peoples, kings, and barbarous nations have accepted, in part compelled by force, in part of their own will, when conquered either by the arms of Rome or by her generosity.

The argument here is put forth by a Roman; the whole passage is a defense of ""giving"" the Italians Roman citizenship, but notice what it rejects: the notion that Italians were fighting over boundaries, and empire.  That means someone was making the case that Italians were fighting over boundaries and empire.  Whether Italians or Romans we don't know for sure, but my money is on the Italians given some of the imagery on their coinage.

While there are other possible causes of the Social War (some argue for economic reasons or reasons of status or elite competition), anyone addressing a question about someone objecting to Roman foreign wars in the Republican period really has to take into account the Roman exploitation of Italians in the context of those wars.  To ignore it would be an injustice."
"I am not a historian per se, but I am a teacher, so hopefully I can answer this question in a way that the mods will allow to remain. If not, forgive me. 

Teachers in all states of the United States are required by law to teach certain standards (standards may vary). I'm based in the state of Texas and we are required to teach the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills in our classrooms. You can find a comprehensive list of those skills here: https://tea.texas.gov/index2.aspx?id=6148

To be more specific, you requested information regarding why students in elementary schools are taught that Columbus discovered the earth was round, Ben Franklin and electricity, etc. In short, they aren't. Here is the link to the TEKS for Grade Level 6: http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter113/ch113b.html

Columbus isn't a topic for 6th graders in Texas, but if you scroll down to section 4, topic B, you'll see that the only mention of Benjamin Franklin refers to his role in the American Revolution. 

While I will admit that these requirements are simply a framework, there is also a system for teachers called the TEKS Resource System, which serves to clarify the TEKS for all Texas teachers. Some teachers will supplement lessons with the textbook, while others will use their own research conducted through college to decide which specific details they will teach.

It is worth nothing that these skills are updated and corrected over time, although I would have to assume that there was never a TEK that said, ""Teach that Columbus discovered the world was round,"" since that fact has been well-known for decades prior to your own experience. "
"> Or you'd find yourself dying unmourned of alcoholism in some sweltering Indian town, another extremely common fate among the less fortunate expatriates in India at this time.

First, thanks for the great answer. 

This bit of a throwaway piqued my interest. You establish that, objectively, this was a bad time to set out to make a fortune in India, but were people still trying? I imagine all the information you laid out might not be available or known to a lower class emigrant, and they might see the riches gained in earlier decades and try anyway. 

Was there a relatively steady stream of British expats going to India in this time period? You mention alcoholism in ""some"" town, would white British expats wasting away be a common sight throughout India?

More generally, would there be any metaphorical ""floor"" for an Englishman in India at the time, some charity or menial job or rescue opportunity that wasn't available to ethnic Indians? Or, once in India, would the lot of an uneducated, lower class Englishman be largely the same as an uneducated, lower class Indian?"
"I spent less time looking at Salazar as I did Franco & Fascism more generally. I will share what I do know although I cannot find my notes (and thus citations) so this *must* be taken with extreme scepticism - I wouldn't be too shocked if this even gets removed. That said, Salazar occupies a really strange space in 20th C. politics and [his foreign policy looked something like this.](https://i.imgur.com/c66bWny.png)

Salazar was, if I'm remembering correctly, a well-trained and respected economist who rose to power (off the backs of conservative elements) on the promise of renewing the Portuguese economy. He was able to do this fairly well, and was so well respected that he rose to the top office by submitting an ultimatum that he needed full control to regenerate the economy. This was not a ploy to establish a fascist regime, although Salazar certainly can be considered a ""dictator"" (i.e. he used repression and violence to solidify his power), and he carried out his economic plans as promised. He absolutely engaged in the kind of Conservatism (borderline primitivism and an ideation of rural lifestyles) that Franco did, but unlike with Fascism this was still steeped in religion and had little to do with ""National rebirth"" as opposed to ""national preservation"" (or even ""reversal""). There was a great deal of social policy during his regime that encouraged a specific (conservative, rural, Christian and at least slightly nationalist) way of life, and this was backed up by a culture of fear and repression, but with something of a leniency not seen elsewhere.

Salazar was *very* careful to maintain neutrality for Portugal, supporting Franco in the Civil War without becoming 'too involved' and remaining a bystander (one that became quite wealthy by selling goods to both sides) in the Second World War. He warmed to the allies as the war went on and was courted heavily by the UK (citing pre-modern alliances between England and Portugal), being given an honorary degree by I think Oxford and being treated as an 'honoured friend' in visits to Britain. This more-or-less solidified his position domestically and allowed his regime to exist long after the war. I really can't say much more, other than to reiterate that his regime occupied a genuinely unique position (still quite authoritarian) that was definitely neither ""Western democratic"" nor Fascist."
"It's been a long time since I've done economic history research and I'll leave interpretation up to the reader and any followup historians, but I'll lay out some facts. Please note I'm only pulling data for the US. I also apologize, I'm not great at narrative history, so please don't expect this to be an exciting explanation. 

Of course averages aren't everything, median is much more important to the question you're asking, unfortunately for us a lot of the modern datasets don't include data as far back as the 1920s, but I'll try to find some where I can. I can't easily find median income data until 1953 ([FRED datasets dealing with median income sorted by observation start](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/searchresults/?st=median%20income&t=&ob=os)). So we'll just have to make do with averages which will still give us a good picture. The share of disposable income going to the richest 5% went from 24% in 1920 to 34% in 1929, so the rich did get richer than the poor got richer, but that is certainly not to say the average person did not benefit greatly from the economic climate (source for this is Gilder-Lehrman linked below)

The [1920 IRS Statistics of income](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/20soirepar.pdf) probably gives a good breakdown of income classes. ~72% of people made less than $3,000 with about an even split between the $1,000 - $2,000 range and the $2,000 - $3,000 range. This $2-3,000 range is likely the grouping you're interested in. By [1929 though](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/29soirepar.pdf) that similar percentile had moved up to the $3-5,000 range. So someone in that 9 year time period had a good chance of seeing their income grow by 60%.

One thing that I think is important is to remember the context, when dealing with the idea of a ""roaring"" public perception we should compare it to what people were used to, I think one easy way is to compare it to the 1910s or so. Where there is data I will use that.

In the late 1910s the lowest income tax bracket rate shot up to 6% (modern rate is 10%), but by the mid 1920s it fell to a low of [1.125%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IITTRLB). This will give you an idea of the lower bound of what people paid, a more median income would of course be higher.

The 1920's was an area of great advancement, certainly wealth piled up on average, the average earnings in 1912 were $592, but by 1924 they were $1,033 (much of this basic data is from [Gilder-Lehrman](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/teaching-resource/statistics-american-economy-during-1920s)). The model T dropped in price from $600 to $290, or basically 1 years average wages to ~3 months of wages, compare that to today's averages of $40,000 for an average new care and median income of ~$36,000. From this same source the number of homes with radios about doubled, the number of cars on the street almost quadrupuled.  

Disposable income during the 1920s skyrocketed to never seen before [heights](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/Q0882AUSQ027SNBR) with the US as a whole starting in 1921 with a mere $50b of total disposable income, but by the start of the great depression only 8 years later that had almost doubled to nearly $84b of disposable income. 

Manufacturing jobs had a brief dip in the post-WW1 era but had started to rebound during this time due to consumer demand rather than government demand (please note this is just an extrapolation from [Manufacturing Corporate Net Income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A09014USA144NNBR), and not an actual jobs dataset). 

Consumer prices as a whole had risen dramatically through the end of WW1 but by the start of 1921 they fell and stayed stable throughout the [1920s](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS). [Groceries](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M06052USFRB11M328NNBR) also were fairly stable during this period.

So to overall wrap this up, people of all class levels got wealthier, the middle and low income classes made dramatic gains in income, prices of goods stayed flat, more people had access to more technology than ever before, luxuries in 1919 were common fare by 1929. People were making goods for other consumers and these consumers had more and more disposable income to purchase goods."

"> Well yes, there were always reporters for the *Novum Eburicum Tempora*.

Just a little Latin tangent: If you’re trying to translate *New York Times* into Latin, it would be something like *Tempora Novi Eboraci* (“The Times of New York”). Latin doesn’t really use substantive nouns as modifiers, in the way that English sometimes does. Here I’ve used the genitive form of “New York,” making it a possessive noun, instead.

There is also the neo-Latin adjective for someone or something  from New York: *noveboracensis*. So you could say *Tempora Noveboracensia*, if you wanted. That would be something like “The New Yorkian Times.”"
"> **Is there a mechanism by which a permanent seat goes to a successor state for any of the permanent members?**

No, not formally. That would mean the UN would need to predict the dissolution of its permanent members, and need to formally legalize how that dissolution would turn out. None of the permanent members have an interest in signing treaties predicting their own political demise.

---

>**Was there any discussion about whether the Soviet Union's seat would automatically go to Russia after it dissolved?**

There was discussion among the Soviet successor states as well as among the global community at large, yes.

>>Furthermore, in  Article 1  of the  fifth  declaration,  entitled ‘On UN Membership’,  the  eleven signatories [of the 8 December 1991 Alma Ata Conference] agreed that ‘Member states  of the Commonwealth  support Russia in taking over the USSR membership in the UN, including permanent membership in the Security  Council.’
>>
>> * Yehoda Blum 1992

In essence, there is no procedure at the UN to quickly and automatically handle the disappearance of one of its council's permanent members, but in the specific example of the 1989–91 breakdown of the USSR, it was quite clear that the Russian Federation, as the geographically and demographically clearly dominant power, has the obvious claim to succeed the seat of the larger organization.

In accordance with the Alma Ata protocol, Boris Yeltsin on 24 December 1991 (the very last day before the formal dissolution of the USSR on 25 December 1991) then transmitted to UN Secretary General a letter via Soviet ambassador to the UN A. Y. Vorontsov, stating:

>>>the membership  of the Union  of Soviet  Socialist Republics in  the  United  Nations, **including  the Security  Council** and all other  organs and  organizations  of  the United  Nations system, is being  continued by  the Russian Federation (RSFSR) with the support of the countries of  the  Commonwealth  of Independent States.  In  this connection, I  request that the name ‘Russian Federation’ should be used in  the  United Nations in place of the name ‘the Union of Soviet  Socialist  Republics’.  **The  Russian  Federation  maintains full  responsibility for all the rights  and obligations  of the USSR under the Charter  of the United  Nations, including  the financial obligations.** I  request that  you consider  this  letter  as  confirmation  of the credentials  to  represent  the  Russian Federation in United Nations  organs  for  all the persons  currently  holding  the  credentials  of  representatives  of  the USSR  to the  United Nations.

It wasn't specifically asked, but I would like to use the space here to point to the neat (and politically confusing) mess that is UN membership in connection to the births and deaths of countries. There is secession (Pakistan -> Pakistan + Bangladesh), incorporation (Germany FR + Germany DR -> Germany FR), union (Egypt + Syria -> United Arab Republic), and there is this specific case, dissolution (Soviet Union -> Russia + Ukraine + Belarus + ... ).

Russia is not the *""sole"" legal successor* of the Soviet Union, and it was the legal position of all new states of 1991 at Alma Ata that the USSR would cease to exist as a geopolitical entity (but it is Russia's subsequent position that Russia has taken the seat of the Soviet Union automatically, thus conveying upon itself a special position within this inheritance – we shall get to that later). Russia is the *""main"" legal successor* insofar as that is a category that is necessary, i.e. when the authority previously held by the USSR as a single country was deemed to not be feasibly divisible between the many successor states (note: even the exact number of successor states leads us into a legal jungle, as the governments of the three Baltic States Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are of the opinion that their forceful inclusion into the USSR in 1940 was illegal and that they should not be considered successor states of the Soviet Union in the same legal capacity that other post-Soviet republics are).

So, a fait accompli was accomplished, and the Soviet seat went to the Russian Federation with the consent of eleven of the fifteen post-Soviet states at Alma-Ata (Georgia was an observer only, and the three Baltic States refused to attend due to their rejection of the legality of their own membership in the USSR). This part of *political* history was thus written, but the debate among *legal* historians whether the Russian takeover of the Soviet seat was technically a breach of international law flared up almost immediately.

Another interesting tidbit: Upon the founding of the United Nations, the Soviet Union was given three seats as a political token, one for the USSR, one for the Ukrainian SSR, one for the Byelorussian SSR. Ukraine and Belarus resumed their seats as independent states, and the other 12 post-Soviet states apart from those two and Russia were accepted separately, following the legal procedure that the United Nations laid out for such instances. But Russia never did. The Soviet Union (not the Russian republic within!) had been a UN member, and Russia with great self-confidence assumed that seat upon the union's demise.

The endless pleasure that is historical legal arguments would almost certainly indicate that, in accordance with the 1947 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly, the rights of a member state to membership cease to exist ""with its extinction as a legal person internationally recognized as such"". Technically, the Soviet seat in the UN should have been abolished and Russia would have had to apply for a new one, like every single of its fellow post-Soviet states with the exception of Belarus and Ukraine had to do. But they did not, and the fait accompli did what a fait accompli does. Such is the difference between technical by-the-books legality and practical by-the-policy politics.

>>The conclusion  arrived  at in  the previous section [that the Russian claim to continuation of the Soviet Union is flawed] – if  adhered  to – might have  also brought about  the elimination  of  Soviet  (and subsequently  Russian) permanent membership in  the UN Security  Council. Such  an outcome  would have  clearly precipitated a  serious constitutional crisis for  the  United  Nations:  the  resulting  situation would  have  violated  the  explicit  provisions of Article 23(1)  of the UN Charter, as amended,  under which  the Council should  consist of five [!] permanent and  ten non-permanent members.
>>
>> * Yehuda Blum 1992

Once the UN, to avoid crisis and constitutional meltdown over the lack of the Soviet Union, accepted Russia's continuity claim, politics has continued from there. Indeed, the UN Charter has never been formally updated, and still lists the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as well as the Republic of China as permanent members of the security council, even though these two have not been on there since 1991 and 1973, respectively.

Regarding your hypothetical with the United Kingdom: If we accept a Soviet-style dissolution of the UK, the Soviet precedent now established means that any English successor government would have a very strong claim to UNSC membership over a Scottish or Welsh government, as England occupies within the UK a similar position of geographic/demographic/economic dominance as Russia did within the USSR. The presence of London that you mentioned helps, but Russia did not receive the UNSC seat simply because the Soviet capital city was located in Russia. There simply was no other politically realistic choice from among the former Soviet successor states. However, the Soviet precedent has also established that *consent* is very helpful, so if, say, the Scottish government objected against an English presence on the UNSC in place of the original British seat, it is conceivable that the outcome would be a different one from the one we saw with Russia and the Soviet Union. But such speculation is of course mostly futile.

Legal history: fun forcefully found in dreadfully dull details."
"Would you be able to expand on the point she is making about white men in particular? I'll be frank, I'm a little unsure of what the following paragraph is actually saying:

>Shrum argues that mirrors became objects through which white men asserted their claims to modernity, emphasizing mirrors as fulcrums of truth that enabled them to know and master themselves and their world. In claiming that mirrors revealed and substantiated their own enlightenment and rationality, white men sought to differentiate how they used mirrors from not only white women but also from Native Americans and African Americans, who had long claimed ownership of and the right to determine the meaning of mirrors for themselves. Mirrors thus played an important role in the construction of early American racial and gender hierarchies.

I'm not sure what is metaphor and what is literal. There are historical sources of white men discussing how they are better at using mirrors than those who aren't white men?"
When I clicked this I honestly figured I would only find 46 deleted comments.
"News were certainly restricted. But private memoirs, letters and diaries tend to display a similar degree of ""reservation"". People talk of politics, war supplies, food shortages, the Bolshevik Revolution, the last German offensive, the settlement of the ""Adriatic question"", Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau, Orlando and Sonnino, Nitti and Bissolati, Jaures and Jouhaux, Dada and Futurism. They do not talk of ""the flu"" except for the off-hand ""sorry I coudn't be there last week: been sick"". 

Those who do - and there might be some degree of source-bias here - are already somewhat ""outside"" of the ""war-discourse"": women more often than not, coming from the poorer strata of the population, and having experienced the worst consequences of the disease (the letter of one mother who told here relatives how she had been forced to fasten together a box with crate-wood to bury her infant child comes to mind). 

Even after the end of censorship - in July 1919 - the Italian public started discussing many sensitive war-related issues (defeatism, desertion trials, decimation, the army command conduct, political responsibilities, corruption and war profiteers, politicians who deserved to be hanged...) but nothing about a disease which had killed - according to the upper estimates adopted at the time - more people than the war and infected about 1/5 of the Italian population.


As to the people being unaware of the severity due to censorship, this doesn't appear to be the case. When funerary services are suspended and bodies piled up onto carts and mass-delivered to the grave during the night, censorship no longer works that way; and there is at least some truth in the idea that the government wished to prevent the spread of more nefarious rumors (after all, it was a German, Pfeiffer, who had discovered the bacillus responsible for the flu, and Germans were known for their devilish chemical weapons...)"
"I'm glad someone took the bait, ahem, I mean, asked the follow-up question.
I'll see if /u/Antiquarianism wants to jump in with a fuller rundown, but for the moment I've got one I definitely want to share as I have one more story which _might_ date back to
the era; yes, that's during the era, not after. It could easily be a story told based on people seeing the image much later,
but, well, [here's a link](https://africanrockart.britishmuseum.org/country/algeria/crying-cows/).

That's the ""Crying Cows"" from Algeria, which also has [art like this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Cave_painting_from_the_Tassili_n%27Ajjer_mountains.jpg).
Algeria is thick with art going back to even 12000 BP, but Crying Cows dates to 7000 or 8000 BP, squarely in the Green Sahara period. There's
a local story that goes with it, of a:

>...shepherd who engraved the crying cows after travelling night and day with his herd to a spring he thought would quench their thirst. Finding it dry, he captured in stone his cattle’s grief as he watched them die one by one."
"By the 14th and 15th centuries, when trebuchets were slowly being phased out in favour of cannons, there were some universities which either had mathematicians but did not require its students to learn maths (as was the case with Paris), or places like Oxford which had mandatory maths courses as well as more niche optional ones. Many early universities, like Boulogne and Paris, lumped maths in with medicine - it's not entirely known why. The regimen at Oxford included:

- 5 weeks of geometry
- 3 weeks of arithmetic
- 8 days each of *algorism* and *computus* (stuff like working with fractions and decimals, ratios etc. but at a complex level)
- 8 days on the characteristics of spheres 

I'm sure you can see why someone from Oxford might make an appealing candidate for design work that was mathematically complicated. We do have a few records of people with a scholarly mathematical background being asked for input on architectural and engineering work, but it's extremely rare. The overwhelming majority of engineers, and almost every single one before the 15th century, were apprentices who learned the maths on the job ."
"You've mentioned a wide range of astronomical tools for timekeeping.  What is the evidence for using biological tools for timekeeping?  Eg, scheduling livestock migrations or planting based on when other biological events happen: such-and-such flower blooms in the Spring, or when this particular tree begins to change color in Autumn, etc."
"[This older thread deals with Aztec and Spanish hygiene.](https://de.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1vqjyc/was_tenochtitlan_circa_1450_if_it_maters_cleaner/)
It's not so detailed, but between the different answers gives some good reading recommendations, and an impression of the high importance of hygiene to the Aztecs. E.g. with daily baths, and with Tenochtitlan having been built on a lake which facilitated cleanliness - so comparatively more important than hygiene would have been for the Spanish at the time. 

I'd add to those posts that the Aztecs also used a variety of deodorants, including flowers and oils, whereas incense was used in different ritual contexts. While incense was given as one of many gifts to Cortés, native authors writing after the conquest period do not describe the Spanish as deities who would have been worthy of ""divine honor"" (as Miguel Flores Pastrana, Stephanie Wood and others have shown). Another version of this story sometimes mentioned, where Aztecs would use flowers instead of incense in order to not smell the Spaniards, seems a bit more likely to me because of this.  

*Unfortunately I'm traveling without source access so can't add to this atm* - hopefully others can add to it since there's some more to unpack with Harari's quote re: incense, native sources and Aztec hygiene.

Edit: added a sentence for context "
This is the kind of content I sub to AskHistorians for.
">	I trudged through a number of lists and came up with prominent 80s sitcoms with married couples: […] None of these seem to be premised around parents that loathe each other.

This probably doesn’t change your overall point, but I’m wondering if this overlooks shows that don’t *focus* on family dynamics, but occasionally *feature* or at least reference them. I’ve been thinking about asking a similar question as OP, based in large part on watching *Cheers* the last several months, which ran through most of the 80s. Norm Peterson’s wife, Vera, is never really seen on the show, so all we know about her comes from Norm talking about her, and it’s almost always a negative joke at her expense or how he hates being married (and the audience usually seems to endorse the complaint). I’m noticing a similar trend in the spinoff *Frasier* (I’m still early in season one, though… plz no spoilers) where Niles seems to casually have an unhappy marriage with his (unseen, at least so far) wife, again played for laughs and not treated as a serious problem except occasionally when he’s flirting with Daphne—but that show did start in the 90s. 

That’s the only show from the 80s I’ve watched more than a couple episodes of, so I’m not sure if that’s an outlier, but I reckon *something* in those jokes was resonating with audiences, because it often felt like the intent and reaction of the joke was to mock Vera, more than anything."
"> It just had to be an Austrian eh. 

I know, I know...

Also kidding, in order to avert crisis,  Switzerland started keeping tabs on the various political exiles by creating the eidgenössische Generalanwalt (a sort of federal attorney) who directed police to keep tabs on revolutionary activity, foreigners, Roma, and other peoples generally considered dangerous. In 1917 this was expanded with its own section of police and keeping further dossiers about Swiss socialists and other politicians. This practice was continued throughout the Cold War and resulted in 1989 in the so-called Fichenskandal when it became known that Swiss police had 900.000 dossiers (so-called Fiche) on a variety of people, including Swiss citizens.

Basically, they still hosted people like Lenin but did spy on them on behalf of their own police and other powers."
"The Gatling did have one massive problem and that was with **Hanging** ammunition.
 
When black powder ammunition has been stored for too long or exposed to moisture, you can get what's known as a **Hangfire**. This is where, after the firing pin strikes the primer, the round doesn't fire immediately, but smoulders before finally going off. The time between pulling the trigger and the round going off is called the **Hang**. Hangfires were common, especially were ammo was stored poorly or handled roughly (like on British campaigns in Africa) with most hangs being only a tiny fraction of a second. However, occasionally some can be much longer with some rounds never going off at all.
 
For a single shot rifle like a Trapdoor Springfield or Martini Henry, hangfires are not a problem, you just aim at the target, pull the trigger and wait till the round fires. If it doesn't, you give it a few seconds for safety, eject the dud round and load a new one.
 
For the Gatling Gun, hangfires were a massive issue. With a Gatling Gun, how long each round spends in the chamber is dependent on it's rate of fire which is controlled by how fast you spin the handle. Spin the handle fast, the gun fires fast but each round only spends a very short time in the chamber. The problem is, if the round is a hang fire, and it's not given enough time in the chamber to fire before it's ejected, it will go off inside the action of the Gatling Gun. As the round explodes inside the action, the two parts will fly away with equal energy, the lighter case will have much higher velocity,  deforming and jamming the action. The heavier projectile will have much less velocity (same energy) and will either fly off into the action too or part way up the barrel. Whatever happens, a hangfire going off inside the action but outside the chamber almost always resulted in a jammed gun that was out for the duration off the battle.
 
To counter hangfires, British Gatling Gunners were trained to fire at two speeds. The first was a very slow rate of fire of only a couple of hundred rounds a minute. This gave each round the maximum amount of time in the chamber before ejection and limited the chance of a catastrophic jam. The second rate was for desperate circumstances when the line was going to be over-run but even then was not that fast. British Gatling Gunners were drilled endlessly so they would be able to maintain these two exact rates of fire in battle when the bullets where flying and their mates dying around them. But even then, the British found that the gunners couldn't help themselves as the wall of African spears came close, and a faster rate of fire led to a much higher chance of a jam, and a jammed Gatling in these battles often lead to annihilation.
 
To quote Sir Henry Newbolt 'The Gatling's jammed and the colonel dead, And the regiment blind with dust and smoke. The river of death has brimmed his banks'
 
The answer of course was to have the machinegun use the recoil of the round firing to eject it and load a new one. It didn't matter how long the round hung in the camber of a Maxim gun as nothing would happen until it fired which caused it to cycle. But today, with hangfires no longer being a problem, the Gatling Gun is back."
Excellent and insightful answer - thank you!
"I feel that these answer a similar question, but do not satisfy my particular question.

They focus on translation such as of 'Pyotr Veliky' into 'Peter The Great', as if that is the same form of translation. Whereas I am focused on a translation that would result in 'Pyotr Veliky' becoming 'The Great Rock'.

That is like someone named Rose visiting Korea, and their name being translated to Jangmi, instead of a simply more palatable form of 'Rose' for the Korean alphabet and accent. My point is we don't take Tatanka Iyotake and transliterate him, as we did with Peter The Great or William The Conquerer, but we completely took apart the meaning of the word and display it as such."
"Most commercial, residential, and public buildings in NYC are heated in the winter with some kind of heating oil. It's delivered in trucks periodically, and the delivery is normally received by the building's super or maintenance manager. When a truck connects its tank to the building's reservoir, a meter starts running on the truck's hose that shows how much volume the customer is buying (amount of oil x rate x price = the bill). The meter has a ball bearing on top of it which is pushed aside when the oil starts running.

The scam is simple: take an industrial sized magnet and scoot it along the pipe until the ball bearing seals off the flow of oil. That way, the meter still runs and charges the customer, but no oil is flowing. Then, late at night, the driver meets with a mobbed up business partner and sells the accumulated extra oil at below market-rate prices.

[Here's one of several NYT pieces about it](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/nyregion/11-indictments-detail-widespread-fraud-in-heating-oil-industry-of-new-york-city.html)

Edit: I should mention that this scam has been used against apartment buildings, churches, hospitals, and even NYPD precinct headquarters."
"This has had a profound effect in terms of studying nationalities within the Soviet Union.

Before the archives were made available, there was no way to accurately analyse the actions of the Soviets in terms of the nationalities within the USSR. And considering there were over 100 distinct nationalities (the number changed throughout the lifespan of the Soviet Union as groups were merged or formed, depending on the politics of the time), this was important.

For years the dominant theory was that the Soviets were ""breakers of nations"" (to use Robert Conquest's phrase from his 1992 book, *Stalin: Breaker of Nations*). They would go into a region and consolidate power around the ethnic Russians, forcing down the local ethnic groups and destroying whatever national identity they had. This also had the benefit of working in tandem with Marxist ideology, which abhorred nationalism: it was seen as a bourgeois means to create divisions within the working classes so they would fight each other rather than the capitalists. The seminal work on this by far is Richard Pipes' *The Formation of the Soviet Union: Communism and Nationalism, 1917–1923*, first published in 1954 (and subsequently updated in 1964 and I think another time). He was devoted to this thesis, and his book follows that idea, that the Bolsheviks came to power via putting Russians in power.

It took the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the subsequent opening the archives to bring about a proper shift in how scholars interpreted Soviet nationality policy. While some had noted that there was more to the USSR than just the Russians, a view presented by Alexander J. Moytl as early as 1989 in his “‘Sovietology in One Country’ or Comparative Nationality Studies?,”  it would not be until a few years later that more in depth scholarship emerged. In this regard there are two publications that set a new course on how to analyse the subject. Ronald Grigor Suny’s 1993 book The Revenge of the Past: Nationalism, Revolution, and the Collapse of the Soviet Union was one of the first treatments on the subject, and it would have an impact on the understanding of the subject as one of the first to argue that nationalism was promoted, not stifled, within the Soviet Union.  Yuri Slezkine’s ""The USSR as a Communal Apartment or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism,"" published in 1994, has also had a massive impact on the way scholars interpret Soviet nationality policy.  Jeremy Smith’s *The Bolsheviks and the National Question, 1917–1923*, from 1999, further expanded on this idea.
  
Since 2000 two major works have been published, that while differing in their interpretation, have set the standard for a modern understanding of the Soviet Union’s early policy towards nationalism and ethnic identity. These would be *The Affirmative Action Empire: Nation and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923 – 1939* by Terry Martin (2001) and Francine Hirsch’s *Empire of Nations: Ethnographic Knowledge and the Making of the Soviet Union* (2005). Martin argues that the early Soviet policies, korenizatsiia, were designed to promote the minority ethnic groups in the USSR, a Soviet version of ""affirmative action"" as he said. He then states that this policy was reversed when it became apparent, to the leadership at least, that it was not having the desired effect, and thus the Stalinist repressions occurred. Hirsch’s book is slightly different, in that she approaches the way the Soviet authorities categorised the various nationalities in the state and how that information was both formulated and then utilised for policy-making. Martin's book in particular is a major conerstone in regards to Soviet nationality policy today, and you can't find any book or article on the topic that doesn't include it in the bibliography.

This has thus led to a change in understanding of how things worked within the Soviet Union, especially the early years pre-Stalinism (c. 1936). Rather than repress nationalities, the Soviet's encouraged them in their nationalism: paradoxically it was seen as an important step, as the theory was they had to move from their ""primitive"" way of life to become nationally aware, *in order to* move past that stage and into proper socialism. This was not something that could be properly understood until the archives were opened and scholars were able to see the discussions of the various Party and government agencies responsible, and why they acted as they did."
"Yes, Alexander is reported to have destroyed or nearly destroyed cities that refused to surrender or revolted, slaughtering people and selling them into slavery, e.g. Tyre and Thebes. The destruction of Persepolis is the best known, but it's misleading since Persepolis was more like an enormous imperial estate or palace complex than a proper city.

This wasn't an uncommon thing in ancient times mind you. For instance, Cyrus is said to have destroyed the city of Opis and ""slaughtered the people"" after defeating the main Babylonian army, though the language used is a bit ambiguous in the original Babylonian. Xerxes sacked Athens, etc."

"Latins had the rights to marriage and commerce that would be recognized under Roman law -- they could own property and execute contracts that would be recognized as valid. Without the ius commercii (right to commerce), the only recourse that non-Romans had to Roman law in the late Republic to protect property rights was by petition to the praetor peregrinus, a Roman magistrate who handled legal cases involving foreigners (peregrini), but Latin citizens could present contracts or claim property rights on their own. Other rights might apply depending on the specifics of the grant of Latinitas. There is considerable debate on the precise legal nature of different forms of Roman citizenship (for example -- [did early holders of partial Roman citizenship pay tributum to support Rome's military expenses?](https://books.google.at/books?id=fyGzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb)), such details probably shifted over time and place, and many of the specifics are unfortunately no longer available to us.

Latin citizens generally voted in their own communities but not in Rome, which elected the magistrates who controlled the Roman world and thus exercised considerable influence over the Latins. It was generally possible for Latins to acquire Roman citizenship (the ius civitatis mutandae) and perhaps (there is [debate on the precise mechanism of this](https://www.persee.fr/doc/ccgg_1016-9008_2001_num_12_1_1544)) to migrate to Rome for the purpose of doing so."
"What a wonderful answer! I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Thank you!
I am very interested in this topic having recently finished reading Dante's annotated inferno."
"I'm not OP, but I am one of the other people on this subreddit who chimes in about 
 the Inca from time to time. I hope I can answer your follow-up questions.

First, it's worth saying the Inca bureaucracy was both top down and bottom up. There was a man in charge of every household, every ten households, every hundred, every thousand, every ten thousand, and then above that were four men, each responsible for one quarter of Tahuantinsuyu,  the Four Quarters of the World. A catch-all term in all of this is curaca, which for our purposes can be equated with the local in charge. If you were in a sleepy hamlet of ten families or a small city of maybe a thousand people, there would be someone slotted into the decimal system hierarchy who was responsible for you and your tax service. If you want to travel, you need his express permission to do so, and you would be issued a pass of either knotted string or a notched stick that would allow authorities on the road to know your business and who authorized you to be there.

You almost certainly would NOT be allowed on the road to get something you needed from another town. The Inca were big on self-sufficiency. There is nothing over the hill that you shouldn't be able to grow or make for yourself here. Meanwhile, they don't want their taxpayers wandering away from where they fulfill their state labour quota. Now some things like salt, metal working, dried chilies, cotton from the lowlands or wool from the highlands, that really couldn't be sourced locally would be transported around the empire by llama and porter caravans. Those goods would be stored in the local tambos (I prefer the spelling tampu, but tambo is more prevalent), and your curaca has the authority to draw from those storehouses as needed on the understanding he had to keep good records of what he did and why, as high-ranking auditors both travelling the empire and back at Cuzco would double-check his work and compare it against the stores available.

So what could a commoner do on the Royal Road? Travel to and from distant tax services, make a pilgrimage to the holy site of his gods, move to a new land as a colonist, and return from military service if a distant war lasted longer than his tax service and his local curaca in his role of sinchi, war chief, decided to stay in the field with new reinforcements, allowing his first levies to return to their farms and families.

Rules of the road? Tambos are spaced a day's walk apart, so travel from one to the other each day, staying at state expense each night with the tampu-keeper recording who you are, what your business is, and which way on the road you are going. Again, all of this can be audited later. Taxpayers really were not allowed to wander around. Also? If two parties of equal rank meet going in opposite directions on the road, the party coming from Cuzco is presumed to be on the more important business. The other party should stand aside and let them pass.

Edit: A thousand people would be a city, not a town, in the Inca Empire."
"Thank you for the in-depth answer, even if the answer is basically “we don’t know”. I honestly figured that was most likely the case but it is nice to have a detailed explanation as to why we don’t know, which is interesting in its own right."
"**One thing I really want to point out is the current situation in Afghanistan parallels the Soviet withdrawal**

On the 27th of April 1978 a coup d’état happened in Afghanistan that would go down in history as the ”Saur Revolution”; Saur being the Persian word for the month for April. This coup d’état was the second of the decade for Afghanistan. In 1973, the King of Afghanistan was overthrown by Mohammed Daoud Khan the former Prime Minister of Afghanistan and the King’s cousin. Mohammed Daoud Khan’s government established a single-party republic that was politically left-leaning. The reasons for the 1973 coup are many but some reasons to cite are ethnic issues and failures of the monarchy to achieve reforms. However, Mohammed Daoud Khan’s time in office was short-lived when his government was overthrown by the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) which professed a Marxist ideology. This new party began to established ties with Moscow and in doing so began to alienated some its native population. Soon the rural population of the majority Sunni Islam country; feeling threaten by the “atheistic Marxists” in power, launched a rebellion against PDPA rule. On 15 March 1979 an Afghan army division stationed in the western city of Herat mutinied against the PDPA, massacring Soviet advisers and their families living in the city, ending with a death toll of 5,000 after PDPA loyalists put the revolt down. Soon after this the PDPA asked the USSR; its Marxist ally, for help to defend its political hold on the country. The reasons for the Soviet’s going to war are many, but as Artemy Kalinovsky summarized in *Decision-Making and the Soviet War in Afghanistan: From Intervention to Withdrawal* that Soviet policymaking during the decade came from a narrow circle within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) Politburo.  Kalinovsky states that this narrow circle believed that a failure of socialism in Afghanistan would damage the Soviet Union’s position and authority as leader of the Communist movement and supporter of “national liberation” movements. He also states that due to positive reports on ground in Afghanistan; the Politburo believed it could transform Afghanistan, stabilize the government, and achieve international recognition of the communist government in Kabul. These listed factors made the Soviet Union reluctantly mobilise its massive military assets into the mountainous country of Afghanistan to defend its ideological ally. The Soviets; like the United States in Vietnam and 21st century Afghanistan, first sent more military advisors to simply train the loyalist soldiers. However, this proved unfruitful as many soldiers simply deserted or mutinied like in Herat. So on the 24th of December 1979 the Soviet Armed Forces launched an intervention of the 40th Army group into Afghanistan numbering 75,000 total. The Soviets expected this conflict to last only a few months. What was supposed to be a few months turned into a 10 year bloody conflict. The Soviet Union’s strategy during the war was to not focus on the rural areas of the country, but to consolidate its forces in urban centres were PDPA power was strongest and secure the transportation networks of the country with the primary focus on using air and armoured vehicle assets to achieve operations and to primarily focus on operations to instill fear into the rural civilian population. The rationale for this largely indirect strategy was the Mujahideen. 

The Mujahideen is where the USA comes into the picture of the current situation in Afghanistan. But first who were the Mujahideen? The Mujahideen were resistance fighters who mainly came from the eastern part of Afghanistan and Pakistan with the majority being of the Pashtun ethnicity. Many were jihadist believeing this war was a holy war in the defense of the Dar al-Islam (House of Islam) against Marxism and Atheism. The Mujahideen were initial only actively supported by Pakistan, who greatly fear that by having a Soviet-allied neighbor to the west and the already Soviet supported India to its east would undermine its national sovereignty. With such little intial international support; the Mujahideen had to rely heavily on guerrilla warfare tactics in the mountainous passes of Afghanistan; focusing their attacks on passing Soviet conveys. This caused the war to be in a precarious balance with Mujahideen winning mostly in their hit and run skirmishes, and Soviets gaining military advances with its armoured vechiles like the T-62 main battle tank or Mil Mi-24 gunship helicopter popularly known to westerners as the Hind-D. The use of advanced Soviet weaponary in the conflict was partial how the US decided to get more deeply involved in the war. In the first weeks of the war, the United States had only given very limited military support to the Mujahideen and condemned the Soviet conflict through rhetoric with such statements as *The Carter Doctrine* of January 1980 in which President Jimmy Cater stated “Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force”. The limited military aid mentioned was a plan drafted by the Central Intelligence Agency known as “Operation Cyclone”. The United States would spend hundred of millions of US taxpayer dollars to train and arm the Islamic fighters in Afghanistan; having some flown to Virginia to be trained in sabotage and espionage. However as mentioned beforehand this support during the first half of the war only went so far; as the Soviets still had air superiority over the Afghan fighters. Also the US did not supply the Afghans with any US engineered weaponry, but only non-US weapons like Kalashnikov rifles and RPG-7’s supplied by China. These weapons had to be distributed by Pakistani intelligence agents as to cover US involvement as greatly as possible. In 1986 however, the United States decided to start supplying more advance American weaponry to the Mujahedeen primarily the FIM-92 Stinger. This push for more advance weaponry was spear fronted by lobbyist from the conservative lobby *Free the Eagle* and members of the defense department most notably Michael Pillsbury. 

As stated earlier the only channel the United States had to supply the Mujahideen fighters was through Pakistan. President Zia was reluctant to introduce US made weapons into the conflict fearing that the Soviets would retaliate. Charlie Wilson who after years defending Zia back home in the States put his fears to rest.
On February 15, 1989 after years of military setbacks and domestic troubles caused by such programs as Glasnost and Perestroika the last Soviet troops were pulling out of Kabul. The jihad fought by the Mujahideen was won. In 1991; the year the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was disbanded, the United States viewed the Afghan-Soviet war as one of the greatest victories in the nation’s convert-operation’s history. It had succeeded in humiliating the Soviet Union, sowing seeds to aide in her destruction, defended America’s hegemony over the Middle East, and did so with mostly untrained guerilla fighters. However in 1991 few could have seen how much of a mistake it was spending so many millions of dollars in the foreign conflict. For the new enemy that rose for ashes of the “Soviet Empire” could arguable be considered much more dangerous than the Soviets ever were. After the Soviet-Afghan War ended; Afghanistan was in chaos. In 1992 the communist government of Afghanistan finally collapsed. In the absence of any powerful central government, Afghanistan was carved up into petty fiefdoms controlled by former Mujahideen fighters, who thanks to the United States and Pakistan had plenty of firearms and ammunition to control their new fiefdoms. These fiefs ruled their territories with their own laws and taxes. David B. Edwards; a Social Science professor at Williams College in Massachusetts who specializes in near east studies, was in Afghanistan at the time described how you couldn’t drive 10-20 miles without being stopped to pay a “tax” to the local warlord. He also described how these fiefs would kidnap boys and girls to be slaves. So in this chaos caused by withdrawal of the Soviet 40th Army, a new faction of former mujahideen arose disenfranchised by this chaos in their motherland. This group started to fight back against these fiefs to try and restore “peace” in Afghanistan. This group of young men gain support among their countrymen due to their quest for a stable and peaceful homeland. This group was the Taliban which means student in Arabic. In 1995, the Taliban finally seized power and started to implement extreme fundamentalist Islamic polices. This was partial inspired by the large Wahhabi influence that entered the country during the Soviet war through the large amount of foreign aid and Mujahdieen volunteers coming from Saudi Arabia and Gulf states. This puritanical Islam quickly became unpopular with the population. These fundelmentalist polices banned virtually all women’s rights that had been gained under communist rule, forced ethnicities with non-Islamic names to change their names, forced grooming habits, and banned certain books etc.

After 9/11 the US finally had to “clean house” in Afghanistan. But in doing so made many of the same mistakes the Soviet Union had made. Such as relying on local Afghan troops to be able to handle most direct operations by themselves. Ultimately by pulling out of Afghanistan the US made the error of creating a power imbalance. Same as what happened after the Soviets withdrew."
"I just want to clarify a few details on the Byzantine crowns.

It's important to always specify that the Ravenna mosaics were created in Italy, a place where Justinian and Theodora had never been, so their representation there is an ideal (as is usually the case in representations of medieval royalty) and not necessarily reflective of exact reality. The diadems that both wear (yes, as another poster pointed out they are diadems with *prependoulia,* the dangling pearls/jewels suspended from the crown) are frequently seen on Byzantine coinage. This pre-dates Justinian's rule, for example on this coin of [Licinia Eudoxia](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/byzantine-emperors-on-coins/fourth-fifth-centuries-emperors/solidus-of-licinia-eudoxia-439/@@images/image/preview) minted in 439. Byzantine standards of court dress almost universally derive from Roman predecessors, so it's safe to say that the crown is directly linked to its classical prototype, the diadem.

The Byzantines actually had crowns of different forms for men and women. This starts early, but becomes crystallized by the eleventh-century Macedonian dynasty. See for example the difference between the crown worn by [Constantine IX Monomachos](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/byzantine-emperors-on-coins/the-macedonians-and-their-immediate-successors-867-1081/nomisma-histamenon-of-constantine-ix-1042-1055/@@images/image/preview) (1042-1055) and his wife [Zoe and her sister Theodora](https://www.doaks.org/resources/online-exhibits/byzantine-emperors-on-coins/the-macedonians-and-their-immediate-successors-867-1081/nomisma-histamenon-of-zoe-and-theodora-1042/@@images/image/preview). One thing to note, the ""spiked crown"" that the OP is asking about, is a woman's crown in the Byzantine tradition. This is seen even more clearly in the twelfth-century mosaic of [John II Komnenos and Irene-Piroska in Hagia Sophia.](https://live.staticflickr.com/6103/6349305816_d2b63f76e2_b.jpg)

Why did the feminized crown seemingly circulate to Europe first? The answer seems to be marriage. As u/Anoxos has pointed out, the so-called Holy Crown of Hungary is actually composed of two pieces, the bottom *corona graeca* (""Greek crown"") and the top *corona latina* (Latin crown). As Cecily Hilsdale has expertly argued, the *corona graeca* is almost certainly a woman's crown and likely part of the bridal trousseau of an unnamed woman of the Byzantine Synadenoi family who married the Hungarian king Géza I in the 1070s. Years ago I made a mock-up of the Holy Crown minus the *corona latina*. It's nearly a match to the form of Irene-Piroska's, though Irene's is taller. I've been looking for the mock-up to link here but I suspect the image is on an external drive currently trapped in my locked-down office. You'll just have to take my word.

There are many apocryphal legends that the crown was gifted to Géza in recognition of his ascension to the throne, but the Byzantines found the gifting of crowns to be culturally abhorrent (Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos explicitly forbids it in his manual on ruling, *De Administrando Imperio*). The Byzantines also had a hesitancy surrounding marrying their women to cultural outsiders, and when they did send women to marry foreign rulers, they almost always sent them with elaborate Byzantine insignia to help them retain their ""Byzantine-ness"" and hopefully communicate the extent of Byzantine authority to their future husbands. You can see other extant examples of imperial women's crowns in the [Preslav Treasure](https://i2.wp.com/scribeaccroupi.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_1670.jpg?resize=702%2C363) (likely belonging to Maria-Irene Lekapene, who married Peter I of Bulgaria ca. 927) and on the cover of the [Pericopes of Henry II](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/3e/f6/793ef6f5aa871defbc2be8a49198ba5e.jpg) (possibly belonging to Theophano, who married Otto II in 983).

One of Hilsdale's key points about the Holy Crown is that it was deliberately re-gendered through the addition of the *corona latina*, and then used as the coronation crown for the Kingdom of Hungary for centuries. The enamels of the *corona latina* are western, not Byzantine, and date to about a century after those on the *corona graeca*. In most cases, the women's crowns were repurposed for the authority denied them by the Byzantine Emperor's refusal to send ""male"" crowns to foreign rulers. It's a very fascinating co-option of symbols and materials of authority. It mattered that crowns came from Byzantium, because Byzantine crowns had an unbroken lineage tracing back to Roman symbols of power.

&#x200B;

\*\*Bonus cool fact, the Holy Crown of Hungary was kept in Fort Knox by the US government after 1945 for its protection, and returned to Hungary by the Carter administration in 1978. A full analysis of the crown's construction that led to conclusions about its being a woman's crown was completed upon its return\*\*

"Question: ""Did people cut spices with something to add weight, like they do with drugs today?""

Spices in the Middle Ages are fascinating because they are simultaneously a show of wealth, culinary necessity, a traded global-commodity, and medicinal. For modern comparison, it's like an admixture of designer watches, coffee, oil, and  pharmaceuticals. So, in the same way we have fake Breitlings, freeze dried coffee, questions around ethical food sourcing and imports, and licensed and illicit drug sales, so too did the global spice trade have an attending host of economic and social factors. Almost inevitably, profit tempts shortcuts and counterfeits. The spice trade was not immune.

The medieval apothecary and merchants in the spice trade would have dealt in goods that extended from medicines, spices, candies, confections, and more things like perfumes, dyes, paper goods, and other stuff. Not terribly different from an early 20th century American ""drug store"" with prescription meds and a soda fountain.

 Chaucer, Boccaccio, and Langland all provide literary reference to spices and medicines. Of particular interest are some references in *Piers Plowman*. We know the guilds tried to add a level of regulation but other ""less authorized"" merchants dealt in spices. The character Glutton is on the way to repent of his sins when he encounters a woman at a bazaar who tempts him with spices in the ale to partake rather than attend church. Additionally, there was often tension between physicians and the blurry line of pharmacist/spice merchant. Physicians tried to wrest control of prescribing rights in many cases. The pharmaceutical guide *Circa Instans* discusses how certain spices keep and spoil. 

But regardless of any efforts by medical workers, guilds, or scientific treatises, ""cutting"" or adulterating the spices occurred. This occurred in the form of not only outright counterfeiting or ""cutting"" but also in preserving or even misrepresenting grade. Another example from *Piers Plowman* is a character named ""Liar,"" who chooses to become a spice merchant. He frequently deals in ""gums"" that are artificially given scent and misrepresented. Scented gums and mints were popular, as seen by their use by Absalom in Chaucer's ""Miller's Tale"" and in other references. 

Fraudulent practices involved the ""weighting"" the spices to make more money, including moistening them. Perfumes were added to certain spices (adding wine and vinegar). Cloves were powdered with higher quality powder extract from ""grade A"" cloves.  Saffron in particular was targeted. Apparently, eggs, must, and lard were added for the flavor and consistency profile, and olive oil was used for the weight. Saffron was a popular target because it's high price for a small amount (the flower has a small yield). Nuremberg and Cologne have fifteenth century documentation of punitive measures for the illegitimate sell of saffron, including confiscation and even the death penalty being levied.

There is a particular mid-fourteenth century case of a merchant named Johanne Andree that was charged with saffron fraud in Montpellier. After a lengthy case that lasted for years, he was found guilty. He admitted to falsifying the weight but vehemently denied that he adulterated the spice. Inspectors noted that honey, oats, powder, or liquor were added. The jury/inspectors were other apothecaries and merchants who all weighed-in and concluded that it had been tampered with. 

The vast majority of my response came from revisiting a great book by Paul Freedman, the Yale historian, called *Out of the East*. The literary references were recollection. I'll source a few more articles and books to look into on the topic if folks are really interested.

Yes exactly.
I've read that the official pretext for the police raid on Stonewall was to stop the Mafia from blackmailing their customers in addition to the more well known goal of arresting drag queens/trans women for impersonation. Was there any truth to the police charges of Mafia blackmailing? Did the Mafia profit via blackmailing their customers?
"Of course PETA doesn't lobby for them. They do, however, join lawsuits, [some of which have successfully overturned target laws](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article243547507.html), providing a practical, popular win for PETA.

But remember, PETA, at its core, is an outrage engine. Every new Ag Gag law sends the animal rights community into a tizzy, which gives PETA the chance to fundraise and make a coherent, reasonably popular point that Ag Gag laws only exist to protect big business from getting caught doing the things they know they shouldn't. The irony is, things like Ag-Gag laws distract from PETA's more off the wall activities, and make PETA seem more normal. It lets people think ""Yeah, PETA was weird over there, but they're right on this issue and will be effective."" - which is a similar strategy used by the NRA.

You fundraise off the law being proposed.

You fundraise off the law being filed.

You fundraise off the law passing.

You fundraise off the legal challenge.

Then you fundraise whether you win or lose the legal challenge.

And if you have sufficient fundraising ability, you can almost always outraise what you really need for lobbying and legal challenges. PETA has a LOT of rich supporters to tap, as well as an excellent email and mail database to tap.

Note: There's really no way to discuss this part without coming into the last 20 years, as ag-gag laws were really new by 2001. And this is really more of a practical than historical explanation."
I wonder why the Chinese and Koreans embraced these spices but not so much the Japanese. Because we traded with the Portuguese too.

So two follow ups, do we know what happens to Laussat once his governorship was over? Was he recalled to France?

And then as for the French citizens that remained, were they given citizenship or some kind of special visa status by the US?"
"I wrote my doctoral dissertation on the Eisenhower administration's policy/policy-making in the Third World (viewed through the lens of Richard Nixon, but that's another issue).

I also have a tendency when answering questions here to write a gross amount of text, so I'm going to focus solely on Guatemala.  One main reason is that the answer here is more clear cut, as the coup to overthrow Mossadeq was a very messy affair (by which I mean far more complex and clunky than the popular image).

The first thing I want to establish is that while United Fruit certainly pushed for the Eisenhower administration to act against Árbenz, the key people were not primarily or even significantly motivated by United Fruit's position.  The same people that authors like Stephen Kinzer (The Brothers, 2013) argue were pushing for the coup so as to benefit United Fruit or ""American business"", namely John Foster and Allen Dulles, actually complained about United Fruit and hoped its power in Latin America could be curtailed.  I.e., John Foster Dulles strongly disliked that there was an ""understanding"" that U.S. administrations acted for the benefit of the Fruit Company in Latin America.  Indeed, even Allen Dulles agreed that the United Fruit Company had caused the administration so many headaches it needed to be made subordinate to Latin American states (so long as those states were friendly), and considered the post-coup plans the CIA had to serve the dual purpose of bringing regional stability and bolstering the cause of weakening the Fruit Company.  Allen Dulles argued that eventually Latin American states would become stable and strong enough that anti-trust suits would become unnecessary as the Fruit Company would have its power smashed by those Latin American states.

I understand it's a rather bold claim I'm making - that the coup to overthrow Árbenz was not primarily done for economic reasons (long-story-short, the coup took place because Eisenhower and Dulles would not allow big C communist footholds in Latin America and through both his own actions and the administration's treatment of him Árbenz was acting more and more like he was or would like to be in league with the U.S.S.R.), but I'll provide sources for that and am willing to argue it more fully if someone with an economic/marxist/revisionist bent wants to dive down that hole.  Keep in mind that I'm not arguing the administration had a sophisticated understanding of Latin American politics (it didn't), nor am I arguing that economics did not play any role (they obviously did).

The basic answer to your question dove-tails with some of my sources.

**Answer:  Yes, a well-informed and well-read American would have likely guessed or concluded the coup occurred due to the influence of United Fruit.**  Many of the notes Richard Nixon took in preparation for his various (sometimes disastrous) missions abroad were based on newspapers.As concerns Latin American affairs, Nixon was in a kind of impossible competition with President Eisenhower's brother, Milton - who was somehow considered an expert on the region seemingly based on the fact that he'd travelled the region and been feted by the upper class - in trying to have more influence and better press coverage for his missions abroad.

Still, Nixon and his staff gathered and analysed press coverage of various events, including the lead up to the overthrow of Árbenz and the aftermath.  While they only had sparse direct access to more local papers (the CIA and State Departments had more, but tended to summarise these in wires to Nixon's staff if requested), what they did have access to showed that Árbenz's overthrow was portrayed in communist or socialist papers as a direct result of American imperialism and for the benefit of United Fruit.  The basic point I'm making is that a well-read and attentive person in 1950s America could likely have connected the dots and concluded Árbenz's overthrow was in some way related to his actions against United Fruit.  What's more, administration officials were aware of this appearance.

At the 202nd meeting of the NSC under Eisenhower, President Eisenhower urged the Attorney General and Justice Department to proceed with a variety of proposed anti-trust suits (some against oil companies in the Middle East), including against the United Fruit Company for its actions in Latin America and Guatemala specifically.  John Foster Dulles also supported the anti-trust suit for the very reason that it would detract from the notion common amongst Latin American nations and others that the ""sole objective of the United States \[sic\] foreign policy was to protect the fruit company.""  To summarise, the Eisenhower administration knew it appeared that United Fruit could basically call in the U.S. government to take care of any problems it encountered in Latin America - this was seen as very bad by the Eisenhower administration for a variety of reasons but namely because the U.S.S.R. could leverage that appearance to create instability and because it led to mistrust between Latin American leaders and American officials.  The key point during this meeting was that Eisenhower and others wanted the anti-trust suit to be brought after the coup, so it did not appear that the administration was removing Árbenz despite him being perfectly correct about United Fruit's abuse of its power.

This probably reads like a mishmash of poorly thought-out policies and often conflicting goals.  That's because it was, and even officials were aware of it **at the time**.  At the 204th meeting of the NSC, Eisenhower's advisers, including Dulles and Nixon, pointed out that the administration regularly failed to provide aid beyond military aid or anti-communist support; which would not address let alone resolve issues in states like Guatemala or Indochina.  However, coups were cheaper than wars, and when you're not considering long-term consequences or simply reacting to the spectre of Communism, they make a lot of sense.

"Apologies, we have had to remove this response. As noted in the OP, the /u/DarrylSnozzberry is already familiar with the source you are using here, as they mention it themselves, so your summary is not answering their question, as they are specifically looking for more engagement with the argument of Pow, rather than a summary of what he wrote. As noted in the abstract this is hardly an uncontested theory, rather one of several competing ones:

>A number of explanations have been offered for the withdrawal by modern scholars. This thesis argues that these theories are unconvincing and contradicted by the existing primary source evidence. As an alternative explanation, it posits that European fortifications produced a strategic problem that the Mongols were unable to surmount in the 1240s with their available manpower and siege engine technology.

"This brings up some more questions for me I'd be curious if you had any thoughts on.

There was another discussion on reddit recently about the possibility of connecting all these serial killers to the fact that many of their fathers were veterans of the second world war, indeed their entire generation was scarred in this way. I can't find the link, but I thought it was askhistorians. 

My thought would be, if there was that strong of a connection in the US, the US was a very small part of the two world wars, we would expect far more serial killers to emerge in Germany or Russia, unless there were some seriously different ways in which those societies dealt with that history.  That said, I have heard of many Russian serial killers (though more recent ones, not ones connected to this history).

Is there anything to these theories? And if so, why have we not seen a massive uptick in serial killers in other countries affected by war?  or have we?"

If you're wondering what's in the 135 (!) removed comments at the time of writing, the huge majority of it is variations on 'Where all the comments at' or 'Nixon was really paranoid, of course he'd do that kind of thing' or 'I'm not a historian but I remember my teacher saying...'.

All of these comments get removed on /r/AskHistorians because the huge majority of our subscribers really do want accurate, comprehensive, in-depth historical answers based on good historical practice and high-quality sources - the kind of thing that an actual historian might write. It's amazing how many downvotes and reports an obvious shitpost can attract on a popular thread on /r/AskHistorians within minutes, thanks to our readers (if you see it, report it!) 

Please see [our subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) for more information on how to write an answer up to our standards. On /r/AskHistorians, we want people answering questions to be able to explain not just what the basic facts are, [but why we know that these basic facts are right, and to put those basic facts into context](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer). This is why we encourage [the use of primary and secondary sources in answering questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_sources), rather than tertiary sources like Wikipedia, podcasts and textbooks.

In other words, on /r/AskHistorians, we'd rather have no answer than bad attempts at answers.

"Sure. The nomen indicated a Roman's gens (usually translated clan or tribe), a (usually quite large) group with nominal kinship ties. The cognomen indicated a relatively small lineage group within the gens - in this case, the Caesar branch of the Julian clan. Caesar's father did indeed have the same name."
"Former paleontologist here.

I tend to agree with you regarding Adrienne's *Protoceratops* - Gryphon hypothsis, but I think that there's some important other details here. Adrienne goes into great detail about how the Greeks and Romans had large fossil bones (almost all mammal fossils) enshrined in temples and worshiped as the remains of mythological heroes, like Heracles. 

Additionally, in China ""dragon bones"" have been used in traditional medicine for hundreds if not thousands of years. These are again almost always mammal fossils.

I agree with you that it's unlikely that cultures around the world found dinosaur fossils, realized that they were the remains of giant reptiles and imagined up dragons. I think it's far more likely that different cultures around the world had a vast array of mythological creatures, and some of those different creatures have, in the modern era, all been lumped into the same category of ""dragons"" despite their vast differences.

However, the evidence in both of Adrienne's fossil books (both *The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times* which you mentioned and also *Fossil Legends of the First Americans*) points towards ancient cultural awareness of fossils, much more so than you seem to believe possible."

"That's the main focus of the Downs piece (rather than my use of it, which was for the primary source work he did researching the various threats of violence after the election), and probably the best quick summary of what he writes is this:

>The shorthand terms “Mexicanization” and “Mexicanized,” born during overlapping 1860s wars, spread rapidly after the disputed 1876 election, appear[ed] in many hundreds of newspaper articles, in private correspondence, and on the ﬂoor of Congress...Legal scholar John Codman Hurd, in his 1881 political handbook, deﬁned a “Mexicanization of institutions” in which “all party contests have the character of civil war”: “The same thing would occur in this country,” he wrote, “if a party, on the theory of a ‘war of ideas,’ should attempt to retain the control of the general Government against the popular vote...In particular, Mexicanization suggested the absence of a central authority strong enough to restrain violence in politics or control the country’s peripheries. The term also tied together a series of stability crises, which might be called a “two governments problem.” In Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, paramilitary organizations and federal troop interventions led to dual governors or legislatures that ran competing governments between 1870 and 1874... More broadly, for much of the 1870s, Americans doubted and debated the old sense of the nation’s providential history, once rooted in faith in republics or in Puritan belief in a divinely chartered city on a hill.

Obviously, it's a lot more complicated than that along with racist connotations, political infighting (support for Mexican Liberals was a partisan issue), and periodic amassing of US troops on the border from the end of the Civil War by Grant to the time where Wilson's campaign slogan was that he 'kept us out of war' - which has largely been forgotten as not a reference to Europe but to Mexico.  It's a very interesting article.

However, since this isn't my area, someone else might be able to chime in to give you more details."
"That is actually a really interesting question, which might be better asked as it's own thread. Without wanting to make a habit of falling back on this answer... it depends. Certainly, during the civil war many Spaniards could see that their conflict reflected Europe's ideological divisions in the late 1930s, and could readily understand Soviet, German and Italian intervention in those terms. During the Second World War itself, though, the answer gets a lot more complicated, and would reflect again the different ways that various groups of Spaniards understood the wider conflict. The Republican exiles, for instance, who joined the French resistance (or, later, the Free French or other Allied forces), could easily understand this as a continuation of their earlier struggle, and hoped that Allied victory would mean overthrowing Franco. Equally, the Spaniards who volunteered to fight for the Blue Division on the eastern front could frame this as a continuation of their crusade against Bolshevism. Yet even these two perspectives present contradictory interpretations of the Second World War, with the Western Allies representing an ambiguous entity that was either engaged in an anti-fascist (and by extension, anti-Francoist) war, or a bloc which an anti-communist regime could negotiate with."

"""Nuclear"" specifically refers to reactions that involve the nucleus; ""atomic"" is vaguer because it refers to the entire atom, which includes electrons. So if you are being pedantic you can say a chemical reaction as an ""atomic reaction"" because it involves electrons being exchanged. Whereas a ""nuclear reaction"" will only involve changes to the nucleus.

This was known in the 1940s and the scientists who developed the atomic bomb preferred the term ""nuclear"" for the above reasons (and because physicists are pedantic people by inclination). However it was felt by the representatives of the US government that any publicity they did about the bomb ought to use the term ""atomic"" because ""nuclear"" was a less-well-known word, whereas ""atomic"" was pretty common. And the concept of ""atomic bombs"" predated Hiroshima considerably as an item in fiction and popular science. So the first articles and books about the bomb all used the terms ""atomic bomb"" and ""atomic power"" and ""atomic energy,"" because these were already part of the popular English lexicon, despite their being somewhat inspecific.

We can use something like Google Ngrams to pinpoint the shift. Here are just [""atomic"" and ""nuclear""](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=atomic%2C+nuclear&corpus=26&year_end=2019&year_start=1800&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Catomic%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cnuclear%3B%2Cc0), and you can see that both were used, but ""atomic"" slightly edged out ""nuclear"" until a big switch around 1955. If we narrow it down to technological categories, [like so](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=%28atomic+bomb%2Batomic+power%2Batomic+bombs%2Batomic+weapons%29%2C%28nuclear+bombs%2Bnuclear+power%2Bnuclear+weapons%29&year_start=1920&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3), we can have a bit more confidence in the results (since we aren't going to get unrelated uses of either adjective), and once again 1955 seems to be the magic year.

What's going on in 1955? Several things, but the major trends I'd note are:

* The development of ""thermonuclear"" weapons. This by itself probably switched things around a bit, because the category of ""atomic bomb"" tended to be used only for fission weapons, with ""hydrogen bomb"" for thermonuclear weapons, but broadly speaking the entire class of weapons would be known as ""nuclear weapons"" starting in the late 1950s/early 1960s. (To clarify since someone else asked: thermonuclear means you have achieved the conditions necessary for nuclear fusion reactions to take place. It is usually only used for weapons that derive some large percentage of their energy output from fusion. All nuclear weapons _also_ derive energy from fission, and even thermonuclear weapons can have well over 50% of their energy from fission, just to complicate things.)

* The development and commercialization of nuclear power, which was a result of both the Atoms for Peace initiatives, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (which allowed for privatization of nuclear power research and the declassification of many formerly secret concepts), and so on. The ""rebranding"" of ""atomic power"" as ""nuclear power"" seems to have been about making it sound more modern, from what I can tell. 

Of course, 1955 just happens to be when they cross over, and as you can see it is not an _immediate_ shift in usage. But basically the Eisenhower era seems to be when there was a concerted effort to change the terminology, and it corresponds with the events I mentioned above fairly well. 

The shift seems to have been a conscious effort to reflect on the situation from the late 1950s onward in which ""atomic power"" and ""atomic bombs"" was associated with the somewhat crude, early generation of technology from the 1940s, but ""nuclear power"" and ""nuclear weapons"" would be used as the more specific, less-old-fashioned sounding term moving forward. Obviously it was not a hegemonic victory — we still talk of atomic bombs, though we tend not to be referring to modern technology when we do so."

"As in most premodern societies, you probably tried to find a job through friends and relatives. If you were a member of a trade, you might join one of Rome's hundreds of professional associations (not quite like medieval guilds, but broadly similar), which would help you find work. Painted advertisements in Pompeii suggest that walk-in applicants were sometimes solicited by individual businessmen. The seasonal unskilled laborers who probably made up the bulk of the Roman free workforce seem to have been hired by individual contracting firms, who likely used the same men (and their relatives) year after year."

"This is great, and wanted to add a few extra bits of info.

From the start of the Putin presidency, the relationship between the Russian president and oligarchs shifted considerably: where in the 1990s an ill Yeltsin in charge of a weak Russian government had to rely pretty heavily on the oligarchs (with the ""Seven Bankers"" informally holding a lot of power), with Putin the power dynamic shifted - the oligarchs get to keep their wealth as long as they support the Russian government and the Putin presidency. The big notable shifts here were Putin's relations with two of the ""Seven"", notably Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Boris Berezovsky, who despite supporting Putin's assumption of the Presidency very quickly broke with Putin and publicly criticized him. 

Khodorkovsky's Yukos became embroiled in a massive legal battle with the Russian government that saw its breakup and Khodorkovsky's arrest in 2003. Starting in 2000 Berezovsky likewise became involved in a number of legal battles with and investigations by the Russian government that ultimately saw him divest many of his shares in private companies (especially in media) and his exile (he committed suicide in 2013, although some question the circumstances). Likewise one of the seven - Vladimir Gusinsky, was forced to sell his shares in the independent television channel NTV to Gazprom (which was the privatized Soviet Ministry of Natural Gas and which had close connections to the Russian Presidency and to Putin specifically - Yeltsin's former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was the chairman, and Putin had him replaced with future Russian Prime Minister and President Dmitri Medvedev).

Gusinsky otherwise kept his holdings (and fell into line), and likewise the remaining seven: Mikhail Fridman, Vladimir Potanin, Petr Aven and Alexander Smolensky supported the Putin Presidency. Putin also promoted new oligarchs who were openly allies, such as Oleg Deripaska and Roman Abramovich. 

But Putin also likewise has developed a circle of supporters who aren't ""oligarchs"" really in the sense of being private businessmen who support the government. A lot of Putin's major political supporters are  *siloviki* (security service officials) who have held senior government positions and/or run state-owned companies, ie the line between government and business is much blurrier, and these people tend to hold government power that turns into massive wealth, rather than the other way around like in the 1990s. Most of the recently-sanctioned ""oligarchs"" are such people, such as Sergei Tokarev, who is a former KGB officer who served with Putin in East Germany and is head of the state-owned oil company Transneft. The more traditional ""private"" oligarchs have actually been more openly critical of the current war, such as Deripaska and Fridman (who is originally from Lviv by the way).

Another thing worth mentioning about the 1990s oligarchs is that they held massive conglomerates, ie most of them held some sort of industry or extractive resource industries, banks, and media outlets. Banks in 1990s Russia by the way are probably better thought of in terms of holding companies, ie they were vehicles for stashing funds and not really based on retail banking or even as investment vehicles for tons of shareholders. So in a contemporary US example it's maybe a little like how Jeff Bezos owns Amazon and the Washington Post, but if he also held a 90% share in Bank of America.

Finally, one last point: Ukraine has oligarchs too! I won't go into the variables on them all, and as far as I am aware they haven't received the same level of attention as the Russian oligarchs, but they exist and have been very prominent in Ukrainian politics and the economy since 1991. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is probably the most well-known name, as before becoming President he was a billionaire who owned much of the confectionary industry (hence him being known in Western media as the ""Chocolate King"") but also the automotive industry and agricultural processing. Some of the other big names are Rinat Akhmetov, Viktor Pinchuk and Ihor Kolomoysky - this is not an exhaustive list though. Many of these Ukrainian oligarchs similarly own media outlets and major conglomerates, and a big part of Ukraine's inability to successfully fight corruption and find macroeconomic stability in the past 30 years was because of these oligarchs' influence.

Interestingly, the Ukrainian oligarchs never quite organized in the same way the 1990s Russian oligarchs did, and so ironically part of why Ukraine has had a much more pluralistic political system is because of these oligarchs. For example Poroshenko is very much a Ukrainian nationalist, while Akhmetov (from Donetsk) tended to support Yanukovich, the Party of Regions, and a more pro-Russian outlook.

ETA - for books that deal with Putin's struggle with the oligarchs, and with the new system that developed under him, I would recommend:

Steven Lee Myers - *The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin* This is also a pretty decent summary of Russian political and economic history from the 1990s to 2012 or so, albeit it's focused on Putin's biography.

Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan - *The New Nobility: The Restoration of Russia's Security State and the Enduring Legacy of the KGB* They are two of the best independent Russian journalists still around. 

Also for Ukraine, as I said there isn't nearly as much on the topic of its oligarchs, but a good work would be:

Slawomir Matuszak. *The Oligarchic Democracy: The Influence of Business Groups on Ukrainian Politics*"
"The answer is: very small apartments. Unfortunately, there are few excavated insulae in Rome itself; the best-preserved examples come from Rome's port at Ostia (a much smaller and very different city) and the apartments built into some of houses in Pompeii. But on the basis of these admittedly scattered examples, we assume that the bulk of the Roman population was forced to endure tenement-style living conditions, with dozens of families in many buildings. In the preserved examples, the size of apartments in insulae varies considerably, with relatively large and well-appointed rooms in the second story, and much smaller units above. References in Juvenal and Martial suggest that flimsy wooden penthouses, with single rooms for itinerant workers and the very poor, tottered atop many roofs."
"The ICSE was notoriously difficult to pass - by design. Depending on when/who was administering it, only something like the top 10-25% of applicants were expected to pass as of their first-go.

It wasn't even given annually, either. It was usually (or at least supposed to be) conducted every 3 years or so, with the local and regional preliminaries conducted in the two years prior... but that schedule wasn't always completely adhered to either (especially in a chaotic era like the Southern Song). Also, it was very usual for a failed applicant to not try again for more than a cycle, as they redoubled their studies in order to better their odds of succeeding the next go-round"
"The provisions of Caesar's will - guarded, like other elite wills, by the Vestal Virgins - were not made public until his death. He probably left so much money (and those fabulous gardens) to the plebs for the same reason he adopted Octavian: because he thought that it would cement his legacy. We don't know if he was thinking in dynastic terms, but he certainly intended the Roman people to remember him as their champion - and he knew that Octavian, as his principal heir, would be the political beneficiary of this legacy."

"The easy and flippant answer to this question is that nobody in the 1490s would have thought the islands described by Columbus were a ""new world"" at all, and they obviously weren't called the ""Americas"" right away. They were believed to have been islands near India and China. It wasn't until 1504 (at the absolute earliest) that the landmasses were recognized as a ""New World"" and 1507 for anyone to refer to them as The Americas. By then, there had been so many expeditions, papal bulls, political and economic squabbles about their nature and legal condition that they were very likely just squeezed into the fairly familiar patterns of trade and dominion as any other place in the world.

Columbus had, of course, sold his first voyage on the idea that he knew of a quicker route to the far east - India and China - than any of the routes long established by the 1490s. There were two main routes in the early 1490s: the landborne silk road and its derivative routes; and the Mediterranean trade, with ports in the Levant and Egypt being the primary trade hubs. Pacific trade was linked to the latter through a short overland route from the Red Sea to Egypt. These routes had made Mediterranean middlemen like Genoa and Venice vastly wealthy and powerful, and both controlled colonies in and around the Mediterranean and Black Seas that linked to land routes and other areas of exploitation. 

Trade at this time was far from disconnected, and it was a major part of international policy, and the connections built between traders and intellectuals in Europe and Asia had a huge impact on the intellectual culture of Europe and the Humanism that was in its early stages in the 1490s. Efforts to find faster, more reliable routes to the riches of Asia were a hot topic, especially because avoiding the Mediterranean meant circumventing the Genoans, Venetians, and Ottomans, who all had a hand in the other trade routes then in use. A direct route to India controlled by a single power would make the entity in control fabulously wealthy. This was obviously important to the very powerful, the kings and their courts and the bankers that helped to sustain them, but also to middling traders and others with an eye for personal advantage in blazing a new and untested trail for its possibilities of profit. Modest traders or moneylenders in continental cities, as well as the students and lecturers and philosophers of continental universities, would all have an interest in new routes, new lands, new peoples, not only for personal profit but also for the more triumphant motives kids tend to be taught in school: exploration and discovery for the sake of the thing itself. These are not necessarily opposing ideas, and the mutual interest in philosophy and profit are impossible to disentangle.

So, Columbus. His first voyage was meant to find a simple westward route to Asia, and he ended up making landfall in the Bahamas, and then tracing a wending route around many of the Caribbean Islands, including Cuba and Hispaniola. By his own admission, in journals and in [popularized letters](http://www.ems.kcl.ac.uk/content/etext/e022.html) written to the court of Spain and published widely in Europe, Columbus was convinced that these islands were quite close to India and China. He of course coined the term ""Indians"" based on that assumption, but also noted that

> I have found no monsters, nor heard of any except on an island here which is the second one as you approach the Indies and which is inhabited by people who are held in all the islands to be very ferocious and who eat human flesh. These people have many canoes in which they sail around all the *islands of India* robbing and stealing whatever they want

He also believed that he had found rhubarb, a plant that until then had been a European import from China, further evidence that he was quite close to the Oriental spice markets that were his goal. On his way, of course, he traded gifts with native people, taking trinkets and jewelry - some of gold - and other goods, and kidnapping dozens of people as well, whom he took back to Europe on his return voyage in January.

He wrote several letters before even making landfall detailing all of his discoveries, both proving that the islands he did find would be profitable to exploit and also that they were indeed a gateway to the Orient as he had suspected all along. The rush to exploit these is complicated, but it's notable that the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, which demarcated the new discoveries along a pole-to-pole line with Spain taking lands west and Portugal lands east, implicitly supported the idea that India was quite close (and reserved for Spanish exploitation).

But around the same time as Columbus found the ""Indies"" the Portuguese were finding usable routes southward along the African coast, and in 1497 Vasco da Gama sailed around the southern coast of Africa and made it to India and returned, meaning that within five years of each other, both a western and eastern route was said to have made it to the Orient. These new routes were understood as new ways to get at desired goods, even if some of the particular discoveries - especially gold - were shuffled into patterns of political control quite quickly.

Amerigo Vespucci's journeys were widely published in the first years of the 16th century, and it was their popularity that led to the change from Columbus ""Indies"" being just a gateway to India to evidence of an entirely new landmass. Prior to this, the intellectual culture of Europe had divided the world into three landmasses: Europe, Asia, and Africa. This new division was partly a consequence of further and larger expeditions by Spain and Portugal to the West Indies and South America and along the African route to India: expeditions returning from the west came with very little in terms of goods or peoples or descriptions of those that came back from the eastern route, and more and more the suspicion was that Columbus had erred in his assertions that he was anywhere near India. Following along quite closely was the publication of [Martin Waldseemüller's map of the world](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg/1920px-Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg), which was the first to depict the new landmass as one wholly separate from the three traditional continents.

It's hard to speculate on what a typical person might read and hear and believe about the discoveries, but it's hard to argue with the fact that both efforts wrought extreme changes in trade and politics in European powers, as many scrambled to dominate the new possibilities in trade and exploitation. Whole industries were formed, national economies were realigned, and those interested in the science and philosophy of the natural world had vastly more opportunities for theory crafting and experimentation."

"As the singer-songwriter [Tom Waits said in an interview on *America2Night* in May 1978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xFqBWyNySk), when asked if he liked to drink: ""I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy."" By 1978, when Waits said these words, the horror of the frontal lobotomy was obvious, but it took doctors some time to realise how damaging the frontal lobotomy was. So it would have likely taken Joe Kennedy some time to realise that the procedure he had put Rosemary through was as damaging as it actually was.

In the 1940s, neuroscience was very much in its infancy compared to today, and the nature of the brain and the location of particular faculties of the brain was still often up for debate. A famous much-studied case of memory loss, H.M., became that way because a neurosurgeon in 1953 excised a part of the brain that was involved in making new memories, in the belief it would help cure H.M.'s epilepsy (which it indeed seems to have partially helped). It was only after careful study of cases like H.M. that neuroscientists began to understand more about how the brain worked (along with the rise of, especially fMRI research in the last 20-30 years); the neurosurgeon had no idea his incisions would have the effect of causing anterograde amnesia. But thanks to intensive study of H.M., we do now. The medical belief at the time was that intelligence worked via the integration of brain fibers from multiple cortical areas. Thus, if a part of the brain was damaged, the removal of brain areas that were damaged might actually *improve* mental function rather than severely slow it down, because it was no longer getting in the way of the rest of the brain doing its work.

So, in the 1940s, it seemed perfectly reasonable to many doctors that the frontal lobotomy might be profitably excised from a range of problematic patients - nobody knew what it was for, and patients afterwards seemed much less upset. Indeed, Antonio Egas Moriz, who pioneered the frontal lobotomy, won a Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1949 for his efforts (clearly denoting that doctors had found it a godsend).

Obviously, however, this belief was wrong. In 1941, when Rosemary Kennedy underwent the procedure, it was still a relatively new procedure in America. In 1942, however, Freeman and Watts published a textbook, *Psychosurgery*, which contributed to the popularity of the lobotomy; the same year, the *Journal of the American Medical Association* published an editorial asserting that lobotomy was preferable in situations were remission was remote. In the popular magazine *Coronet* in 1942 was an article titled 'Psychsurgery Cured Me', with a tag line about how it was an ""inspiring story of a nervous wreck, miraculously restored to normal life and happiness by a surgeon's knife"". In 1941, in the *Saturday Evening Post*, an article about the procedure suggested that ""from problems to their families and nuisances to themselves, [many] have been transformed into useful members of society. A world that once seemed the abode of misery, cruelty and hate is now radiant with sunshine and kindness to them."" So, all things in all, Joe Kennedy was simply following a promising new medical procedure that doctors were advising; it would not have been initially clear in 1942 that Rosemary's condition after the surgery was a problem.

Some doctors *had* argued against the lobotomy from the start as being too radical and/or a violation of the Hippocratic Oath, but they clearly didn't have enough heft to have it banned. The first particularly prominent public criticism of the lobotomy came in published articles in *Time* and *Life* magazine about the procedures in 1946, based on criticism from (Freudian-influenced) psychiatrists who believed that the neurosurgeons didn't understand the mind. But psychiatrists speaking Freudian gobbledygook were easy enough to ignore. So between 1941 and 1947, at least 1725 lobotomies were performed, it being seen as a proper and useful medical procedure. Thus the Nobel Prize for Egas Moniz in 1949.

It was instead in the early 1950s - ironically, as the lobotomy became much more popular thanks to the hoopla around the Nobel Prize - when it became clear that the lobotomy was particularly troublesome. The National Institute of Mental Health in the USA held several conferences around 1949-1951 which suggested that lobotomies were being carried out much too carelessly, and that criteria for outcomes were not specific enough (e.g., it was hard to tell whether there was improvement as a result of lobotomies because nobody was really looking properly). This disquiet eventually resulted in a landmark 1958 study by AA Robin, which carefully measured things, and convincingly found that lobotomies did not improve outcome. But also, before 1958, neuroscientific knowledge had progressed to the point where it was realised that the typical prefrontal lobotomy as practiced by most psychosurgeons was also excising the 'visceral brain' (including the hypothalamus), and not just the prefrontal lobes (and that Freeman and Watts were nowhere near sufficiently careful enough in their excisions, to the extent that they weren't accounting for differences in brain size).

Public opinion against the frontal lobotomy turned decisively in 1949, when a scientific meeting where harsh words were said about the frontal lobotomy was reported upon in *Newsweek* and the *New York Times* In 1950-1951, articles in the *Scientific American* and the *Saturday Evening Post* struck an ambivalent tone about the procedures. In 1953, a *New York Times* article titled ""Lobotomy Banned in Soviet As Cruel"", concluded that 'the procedure is contrary to the principles of humanity', and that 'through lobotomy, an insane person is changed into an idiot'. 

Despite this criticism (and perhaps because of the Nobel Prize), many neurosurgeons continued to perform lobotomies in the early 1950s; it was only with the introduction of chlorpromazine to treat schizophrenia in 1954 that lobotomies started to recede in prominence. But Freeman was still advocating the procedure in public as late as 1958 and still performing them as late as 1967.

So while Joe Kennedy may or may not have been horrified by what had happened to Rosemary Kennedy after the frontal lobotomy, frontal lobotomies were still a common surgery a decade after her operation, and many doctors would still have been advising concerned parents that a frontal option was a better option than the alternative.

It should still be pointed out that doctors still remove important parts of the frontal cortex in specific situations, to try and alleviate issues for patients. For example, in severe cases of epilepsy, parts of the brain that seem to precipitate the seizures are sometimes removed, and this can include parts of the prefrontal lobe in some cases; in my other life as a music psychologist rather than a Reddit historian, I reviewed at a bunch of research that had been done on people who have had (parts of) their temporal lobes excised (edit: as /u/sunagainstgold points out, these are lobectomies, not lobotomies, and for the unfamiliar, the temporal lobe is a different part of the brain to the prefrontal lobe), because that surgery had a severe effect on their ability to understand music (note: yes, that's fascinating, but no, you'll have to ask about that in another subreddit).

"I have a couple follow-up questions, being a resident of Montana:

I may be mistaken, but aren't many of these aspects shared in Montana? We have oil, and certainly had a massive mining boom with the copper industry (Butte, in particular). We also had a Transcontinental Railway passing through many of the larger mining communities, as well as the Homestead Act offering free parcels of land to settlers. 

I know the fur trade in the U.S. was more concentrated towards the coastal region, but I couldn't help but wonder what the significant deviation in the shared aspects, such as railroad access and lucrative industries such as oil or copper, between Montana and Canada were and how they affected the difference in population settlement/density.

"It would vary quite a bit. During the nineteenth century, it was possible for individual travelers to purchase mummies and ship them back to Europe without any interference from customs authorities. So, the most common sort of mummy unwrapping party would be a standard Victorian dinner party held by a friend of yours who has recently return from his travels abroad. Instead of showing photos, he would regale you with tales of his journey. As the featured event of the evening, he would bring out the mummy he had purchased, place it on a central table (could even be the billiard table in his games room) and remove the bandages any way he could. During the process, he would attempt to spook you with stories of ancient curses or impress you with his knowledge. At the end, the mummified dead body would be on display. The overall effect could be either one of a learned lecture or of telling spooky stories around a campfire.

The second type was a form of public spectacle. You would be invited to an exhibition featuring artifacts returned from Egypt (i.e. looted) and, after having traveled through the exhibit and dined, a sarcophagus would be brought out and opened with great ceremony. The mummy would be slowly unwrapped by someone with considerable expertise. The jewelry and protective amulets found within the wrappings would be shown to all and passed around. Some exhibitors even had a rotating stand which they could place the mummy on, so they could unwrap the mummy with great flourishes and show all sides as the body was slowly unveiled. After the body was unwrapped, you would be invited to come closer and gaze into the face of an ancient prince/priest/whatever. Giovanni Belzoni, a former circus strongman who was a prolific looter/Egyptologist, is perhaps the most famous of the showman-type unwrapping party throwers. (See ""Popular Exhibitions, Science and Showmanship, 1840-1910"" by Jill A. Sullivan, pp. 206ff)

The third type was the most exclusive and was part of a meeting of a learned society such as the Royal Asiatic Society or the Mechanics Institution and involve the ""great and the good"" of society (aristocrats, bishops, doctors, et c.). Such an unwrapping would be considered essentially an act of scientific study by scholars and accompanied by a lecture. You would be gathered around the mummy, which could be in its original sarcophagus or only in its bandages. The speed of the unwrapping could vary quite a bit, depending on whether those gathered were interested in the nature of the wrapping itself or in the body and the mummification processes involved. Those with the talent would be called upon to sketch the unwrapping as it proceeded with the idea of presenting the sketches as a record of the procedure or as the plates that would form part of a scholarly publication. The person doing the unwrapping would be a doctor or surgeon. Once the body was unwrapped, it would be examined minutely by the participants to determine what could be learned anatomically and about the mummification process (although some participants would likely be more voyeuristic than scientific). The body and its wrappings was usually donated to a museum after the party. Thomas Pettigrew became quite famous during Victorian times for this type of mummy unwrapping party, and wrote about such parties in the introduction to his book ""A History of Egyptian Mummies, and an Account of the Worship and Embalming of the Sacred Animals by the Egyptians; With Remarks on the Funeral Ceremonies of Different Nations, and Observations on the Mummies of the Canary Islands, of the Ancient Peruvians, Burman Priests &c"" published in 1834.

"This is both an important question, and, as many other respondents have noted, also a thorny one.  While I appreciate the citation of Heller as a strong indication of modern interpretations of the history of the phrase “well-regulated militia” as seen through legal eyes, both the controlling and dissenting opinions have found dissent.  Since much of the origin of that dissent falls outside of the historical realm (and long discussion of it would violate our 20 year rule), I’d rather leave that for now and look to some historian’s interpretations, and see if that helps illuminate your question.  

(Apparently I was had typed this up this morning that comment may have been removed for that reason, so sorry if I am responding to a phantom post now)

Just as a caveat, though: Clearly this is a question that has sharp divides, and the context of the way the question is framed today might itself be seen as ahistorical.

As noted above, there is a well-established concern that a militia stood in contrast to a Standing Army, which was seen as the “tool of a tyrant.”  But one of the ways to answer this question about the militia specifically is to examine the historical context of what constituted a militia (and here I am focusing on the period before the Revolution) versus what did not at the time, since colonials did react to armed citizens taking up “defense” differently in different contexts.

In general, for a militia to be “well-regulated” it would have to have been mustered out by colonial authority, specifically the colonial Governor.  Other groups that owned individual weapons and “mustered out” on their own – even if was regional and massively popular – were seen not as proper militias but as illegal actors or vigilantes.  On the eve of the American Revolution in South Carolina, there was a set of vigilante groups in the western backcountry that eschewed the courts and decided to muster themselves out and attack outlaw gangs.  This “Regulator Conflict” of 1767 was not seen as a proper use of militia but instead as a criminal activity, although people in the Western backcountry saw it as simply a necessity due to lack of governmental protection afforded to people by the governments along the coast.  (I should note that western backcountry uprisings and “taking law into their own hands” is a subject worthy of an entirely other thread, one can go back to Bacon’s Rebellion as an example.) The eerie parallel is that the regulator conflicts presaged some of the complaints American Revolutionaries would have after the implementation of smuggling offenses being tried in the military Vice-Admiralty Courts – there were too few courts, too far away, although in some ways the complaints were polar opposites – the backcountry decried the lack of convictions of criminals, whereas the Vice Admiralty Courts were seen as tools of oppression, placing colonials who (in the colonials minds) were doing minor civilian infractions being sent to military Tribunals.

So not every group of citizens arming themselves and engaging in “defense” was seen as well-organized.  Also, some historians have argued there is evidence in the early Republic that the second amendment was not seen as an individual right.  I am specifically thinking of an essay in the collection edited by Saul Cornell, Whose Right to Bear Arms Did the Second Amendment Protect? – and I apologize as I do not have the book on hand and a quick google search didn’t help me find the list of essays, but I’ll come back later and append if there is interest – but one of the early essays in the book cited the example of George Washington’s experience with the Whiskey Rebellion – not only, as mentioned in a previous response, drummed out the militia to deal with the uprising, but he also ordered disarmament of the Rebels.  Therefore, the author concluded, the second amendment was not was not intended to reach beyond the militia mustered by the government.  However, the point of that text was also to show other historians who had differing interpretations as well.  It’s a good resource to examine some of the historiography of the debate.  One of the co-editors, Cornell, is famous for making an argument that the two legal methods of viewing the second amendment (individual or collective) are both not quite right, and there is a third view entirely.  Since I have not read his book on the matter – only an abstract and reviews – I cannot comment on its veracity, but as he is a rather esteemed scholar on this debate you may find it of interest as to how the framing of the debate today may be in and of itself flawed when we ask these questions.

However, one needs caution.  I want to point out that some historical books need to be avoided.  I myself was influenced at one time by a book that was highly lauded but ended up being upended.  One of our great modern scandals involving the Bancroft Prize happened when in Emory professor Michael Bellesiles published Arming America, which tried to argue that the American value of gun ownership was more a locus of Pre-Civil War America and not a phenomena rooted in colonial, Revolutionary, or Early National America.  As a new Assistant Professor, I personally tailored some of my lectures around what was seen then as groundbreaking new scholarship.  As you might guess, it ended up that the book was an embarrassment – indeed, a lot of the evidence was simply fabricated – and it led to the Bancroft Prize being rescinded.  (I think this is the only time that has happened.)

One other area worthy of investigation is to recognize that the idea of what constitutes a militia evolves as well over time in America.  Since this goes beyond my period of expertise, and I am not specifically a military historian, I will let my colleagues tackle this if they wish, but I would point to the fact that Congress has defined the militia differently over time, and as pointed out in another response, the rise of the National Guard codified the militia in a way that was clearly different from colonial understandings.  You might wish to look at the The Efficiency in Militia Act of 1903 passed by congress to get one such example.

One last note:  Because of the politicization of the gun issue, the diminishing role of the militia in United States defense and the rise of the Professional (standing) Army has often been treated in a bubble.  But I would argue that you can see parallels in other American institutions as well, where previously services that were volunteer or privatized and sometimes scattershot begin to be seen as disorganized, unresponsive, or ill-equipped to handle the challenges of an expanding population and urbanization over time (and particularly by the late 19th and early 20th centuries) and that expanded roles for government organization and professionalization are called for:  The evolution of city watch and Sheriffs to the Robert Peel model of policing that is the foundation for much of our structure of modern police forces; there is a similar evolution from volunteer firefighters into modern professional Firefighters.  Since Police, Military, and Fire response all entail safety and all have had somewhat similar evolutions into professionalization and government institutionalization, looking at the way who is tasked to do these behaviors – and who is prohibited – may provide insight into how control over these institutions have evolved without stepping on the second amendment political landmine.

"I'm not touching current events with a 39 & 1/2 foot pole, neither directly nor by comparisons. As some other posts point out, the most financially strapped presidents tended to be 19th century, with a few 20th century examples. However some early presidents dealt with sizable debt (and moreso in today's terms cash flow). Washington had to borrow money to be able to travel to his own inaguration. Monroe owed thousands when he left office and ultimately moved in with his daughter (but did pay it mostly off previous to that). Madison neglected Montpelier and lost quite a bit towards the end. Even JQ Adams had to sell property to clear the debts of his father. The winner of early American indebtedness and wealth spent presidents, however, is Mr Thomas Jefferson. It's estimated he was worth 212M$ at peak, about half of Washington and twice Madison, and died a little above even, assets to debts. But to see why we really need to look at a larger picture, so let's talk some Jefferson.

For the most part, he carried a ""typical"" Virginia farmers debt until 1773 when his father in law, John Wayles, died and quadrupled what TJ was on the hook for. Debt was very common in the 1770s and particularly for tobacco farmers. Debates over repayment of English held debt actually were part of the 1783 treaty and factored in the 1794 Jay Treaty, with final resolution coming in 1802. In the same month (May) back in 1773, his best friend from childhood and brother in law, Dabny Carr, also died, leaving Jefferson to care for his sister and her children as well. From then on, his home in Charlottesvile was crowded even when he was away - which he was away a lot. He spent a big chunk of the 1770s in Williamsburg and Philly, then became governor of Virginia. He retired after that, but soon Martha would die, shattering his everything. He took an appointment and spent five more years away, this time in France, spending massive piles of money all the while. 

He stopped recording a ledger of finances in the 70s, but continued recording purchases as if to somehow remain in control of his balance sheet. His farm never performed how he planned and he was rarely there to oversee day to day operations, further limiting his returns on crops and goods. Returning from France, he continued to spend. Upon arriving in town to serve under Washington, he had a case of wine delivered for the new president, and a second for himself. He then bought a toothbrush, and a new painting. His book collection was worth a small fortune by this point, and he was always willing to sign bonds for his friends. His eldest daughter married a man of poor reputation, by some accounts a wife beater and by all accounts an alcoholic. For most of her adult life, he would care for her.

It got worse after he became VP and even moreso as President. 40 years had been spent in public service, and he was broke. Soon the needle went from green(ish) to red and he was truly indebted. Post presidency, he never slowed down. His house was crowded with family and visitors daily, yet all were fed and housed which took a demanding toll on the crop yield, one report saying the mountaintop farm barely grew enough to feed the mountaintop guests. Still, he didn't slow down entertaining or spending. Ironically, he eliminated 30M$ in American debt - about a third of what we owed - while his personal assets continued to spiral. In 1809 he finally finished comstruction on Monticello; the mountain top was levelled in the late 1760s and construction started in 1769, some 40 years earlier. It had been built, then rebuilt. And it had cost a fortune.

The Library of Congress had been burned by the British, so he sold his personal library to America for a fraction of what he had paid; over 6,000 books were bought for a little under 24,000$ - still, it would not clear his debt (and in true style he immediately began purchasing more books - he couldnt live without them, ya know). For the numbers, that's about 4$/book, which 1£ in 1800 equaled about 4.40$, so he recieved about a pound/book - when the average price was at least several pounds each. He was by now an absolute master of creative financing.

A few years later, in 1817, about a decade after leaving office, a friend asked him to sign a bond for 20,000$, so he did. The farmer defaulted and soon Jefferson was paying over 1200$/month just on that one loan. The farmer also happened to be the father of his grandson's wife, who was mortified when she learned of it. Jefferson never said anything to her about it, and upon seeing her for the first time since the occurance did not give his typical greeting, instead embracing her with open arms and a great big hug. While money was important, it wasn't *so* important that you'd put it above family. Not to Jefferson, anyway.

1819 caused more trouble and soon he was really massively in debt. He devised a plan - Monticello would be sold in a lottery. It was valued at about 70,000$ (1.5M today), and everything was taking shape. Then a private group of citizens in NY offered to raise the money for him, so the lottery went on pause. They raised about 16,000$ - a small portion of what he owed. By the time they relaunched the lottery campaign, the excitement had partly slipped away. One of his last acts was paying customs duties for a shipment of wine he would never live to drink. With the 50th anniversary of the Dec of Ind came Jefferson's death, on July 4th, 1826. People suddenly didn't care about bailing out his kids as much as they did him, so while he died thinking the lottery would work, it did not. Shortly after an auction was held to absolve his debts, selling his lands, mountaintop home, furniture, kitchen wares, books, paintings, and about 130 people. The family kept his entire private suite of furniture, along with some other personal mementos - the rest was carried off his mountain one by one in the arms of new owners. It would raise enough that his grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph - the son of the alcoholic - could clear his debts. At death, they were the highest they had ever been in his life: 107,000$ in debt. In today's money, it would be about ~~1.5M$~~ 2M$. About 50 years after his death the final payment on his last account was made. In 1826, just before his death, he wrote;

>(T)he wonder … is that I should have been so long as 60. years in arriving at the ultimate & unavoidable result.

He meant selling his home. The place he put his heart into. The place he so loved he went for solo horse rides around it in his 80s. The place he had wandered the woods looking for peace after Martha's death. And the place he and Dabny came as boys and made a pact. The first to die would be burried by the other under the oak which they sat under to read; it is now the cemetery at Monticello, and he knew it must besold.

The public didn't really care. Even with his personal disaster, he was a fiscally sound president. He had heralded a new era for many Americans (and nearly caused new England to secede because of it), and as long as he was a good president and didn't default, he could spend his eyes out. Some were fearful he would be re-elected again and again, becoming a life president, and they threw everything they could find at him. While that didn't really happen, he did serve two terms, followed by his ideological brother, Madison, serving two of his own. Then came another Jeffersonian, Monroe, with his two terms, J.Q. Adams snuck in for a term in 1824 but was quickly followed by two terms of Jackson, who we could call a quasi-jeffersonian. It isn't a hard picture to paint that, despite being in debt from his mid 20s until his death in his 80s, he was popular enough usher in the *Virginia Dynasty* of presidents.

While certainly not the only president in debt or  borrowing to sustain a lifestyle, he makes the list of notable occurances. A really important part of this is just how different their world was. For instance, all of this credit was issued to white men with property, always, and it wasn't as a direct mortgage, either. Apply this fact to today: back then, mortgaging your property meant losing your ability to vote.

-Sayuri Loza, 2019

___

In 2013 the mayor of La Paz declared the ""Cholita Pacena"" to be an official [""Intangible Cultural Heritage""](https://ich.unesco.org/en/what-is-intangible-heritage-00003) of the city, and I've spent 7 years trying to figure what exactly that means.

Most Intangible Cultural Heritage is things like [music or food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists). Several Bolivian festivals are on the UNESCO list: [Oruro's Carnaval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaval_de_Oruro) and [Alasitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alasitas) in La Paz. None of the items are people.

Before we get into that... who is the *chola*? 

The term comes from colonial Spain's obsession with heritage and bloodlines. While the *casta* system of strict racial heirarchies was not as prominent in South America as it was in Mexico, ""chola,"" which originally meant the child of one indigenous parent and one *mestizo* parent, did see frequent use in the Andes. It would come to refer specifically to rural women who came into cities to sell at markets and to work domestic jobs- women who lived in Aymara towns (the most populous highland indigenous group) but spoke Spanish and did business. Naturally, chola apparel became a cosmopolitan mix of styles. The bowler hat/derby hat/*bombin* is not traditionally Bolivian so much as it is traditionally *chola*. 

But why, of all things, a *bowler hat*?

Popular answers to this question center on the construction of a railroad from La Paz to Peru by a British company. This scenario puts British people in Bolivia just before they seem to have become popular, and explains why the trend is limited to La Paz (though it can be found in many parts of the country nowadays). Some say a shipment of hats for men was too small, so the women wore them instead. Some say they simply sent too many. Some say a clever British businessman, who could not sell his hats to men who already owned them, convinvced some women that the hats encouraged fertility. Variations on this appeared at least as far back as the '60s; I haven't been able to find any earlier references.

How reasonable is this narrative?

Between 1870 and 1930, companies in North America and Europe spent millions to develop the infrastucture of Latin American countries. This was entirely for their own benefit, as their industrializing economies needed the copper, iron, and tin found in the region. Before the 1880s, the tin and silver from Bolivian mines had to be transported by mule or llama. The process was slow and, more importantly, terribly expensive. One contemporary source suggests that 10,000 Bolivian silver ""mines"" had been abadonned simply because of the cost of transport.

Local companies that attempted to modernize their own infrastructures typically lacked the capital to do so. Both Chilean and Bolivian firms planned railqays to link highland mines to coastal ports, but were hindered by the steep cost of material and equipment. And while the War of the Pacific between these two countries ended in 1884, it wasn't until 1904 that a treaty resolved the current territorial boundaries. That treaty robbed Bolivia of its port at Antofagasta, a decision that [continues to be contested](https://images7.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED118/56089cf932672.jpeg). The railroad connecting Antofogasta to Oruro, and thus the rest of Bolivia, was only completed once British investors took notice.

Often, foreign companies would continue to own and operate railroads and utilities once they were built, much as they did (and still do) with the mining operations they connected. The British-owned Antofogasta and Bolivia Railway Co. completed their work in 1892, but exerted influence over most every new railway built in the country for the next several decades. When the US-owned The Bolivia Railway Co. drafted plans to extended the network into Western Bolivia, the British company lobbied for a government intervention that granted them a majority stock share.

It's very likely, then, that British involvement in Bolivian railways at the turn of the century caused the diffusion of the bowler hat into the La Paz region. This theory is stated in passing in many publications, though never with any footnotes or citations. The *bombin* is conspicuously overlooked in both English and Spanish literature; instead, it focuses mostly on the *pollera*, the large, colorful, layered skirts that give their name both to the *mestizo* women who wear them (*mujeres de pollera*) and to the the complete outfit. To wear *pollera* is to wear the hat, the jewelry, the shawl, and all the rest.

That leads us to the more interesting question: why are there so many legends about the origins of the Paceña chola's hat?

___

The first answer is that the trend seems a lot more unusual in retrospect than it would have seemed at the time. 

There's no good date for when the bowler first became the hat of choice. Christine Beaule, Nell Haynes, Kate Maclean, Andrew Canessa, and Mary Weismantel have written with incredible insight on the politics and signfiicance of *chola* fashion, but spend little to no time on the history of hats. The Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folkore put on an incredible exhibit of historical photographs of cholas in 2015, which I had the privelege to visit and has an extensive [digital catalog](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uijeuny78pZNr51p_3pVZEj4p6KuGD0C/view?usp=sharing)- yet hats get barely any attention. A brief 1987 study by Lissette Canavesi de Sahonero, one of the first to formally document chola fashion, quotes a La Paz resident who knew an Italian, Don Domingo Soligno, who set up shop in the city in 1920 and brought the noted Borsalino brand to a new market. It's unclear when that was though- it's simply described as ""later"" or ""after.""

What we can say is that the trend was well-established by the 1920s. A 1924 travelgoue by one C.K. Michener describes the hats of *mestizo* cholas:

> If she is of high caste, she wears a wide-brimmed bowler of glazed white straw, and if lower in the *chola* scale a smaller affair of felt. Perched, in either case, at a slight and seemingly unconscious angle.

These round straw hats are certainly a local invention, and not a ""proper"" derby hat. A similar thing is described in the paintings of Bolivian-American Antonio Sotomaoyr, in which women wear:

> stiff, glossy Panama bowlers that look like fanciful debry hats

Much earlier, in 1905, the geographer Arthur Hill observed that:

> Cholo women, that is the half-breed Spanish and Indian, are in marked contrast to the pure Indian women, since they wear finely-plaited straw hats jauntily placed on the side of their heads

As with other sources from the start of the century, Hill explicitly associates a specific hat with *mestizo* women. Whether or not these hats were round bowlers is not stated; however, the ""jaunty"" placement is something foreign observers continue to remark today.

That women would wear hats at all was also not unusual. A [1912 commerce report](https://books.google.com/books?id=ktpXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=%22commerce+of+bolivia+for+1912%22&source=bl&ots=QDz9pOCtd8&sig=ACfU3U0a6yoG-kY4jF8NQTd4ZDLYwineHQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiPicWYptbrAhXVVc0KHX73BPEQ6AEwAHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22commerce%20of%20bolivia%20for%201912%22&f=false) says 50,000 Bolivianos worth of women's hats were imported. This is just a sixth of the value of imported men's hats- but boy did they import a lot of hats. Of the 50 categories of manufactured goods listed, men's hats is the 11th highest. The value of imported women's hats is greater than that of cosmestics, of agricultural equipment, and of many other goods.

The earliest photographs of cholas show both the [white, straw](https://i.imgur.com/5eeW3yW.png) version and the now-standard [smaller, felt](https://i.imgur.com/9snidO1.png) version. Both of these images can be found in the MUSEF catalog linked above and likely date to the first decade of the 20th-century.

Sketces from Charles Wiener's *Perou et Bolivie*, based on his 1875 travels though the Andes, show women wearing a [diversity of brimmed hats](https://i.imgur.com/dFX0fT6.png) that aren't quite bowlers, but aren't that different. [This 1870 photograph](https://i.imgur.com/7TAIFI2.png) is unfortunately difficult to make out, but the woman's hat definitely has a narrow, curved brim. Melchor Maria Mercado completed an album of sketches and watercolors in 1859, which shows women in [short, brimmed hats](https://i.imgur.com/G3qI0IL.png) and what appears to be a [top hat](https://i.imgur.com/EP89eVe.png). Such a hat can be seen worn by women in the bottom right of [this sketch](https://i.imgur.com/CW2UKDn.png) from 1830; the author Edmond Temple describes as similar to a [Welsh hat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Can3442.jpg/220px-Can3442.jpg) with a short brim."
"There's been a huge push in culinary circles to rediscover and reinvent classic British cuisine, that has met with some success. It's been largely infused with imported and immigrated cuisines, resulting in an interesting landscape of food in the modern UK.

We're over the worst of it now, but I still have many memories of mushy vegetables and dry pork chops being a Sunday staple."
"European Gothic Christian churches are also ironically (considering their connotations today) not dark at all! Using new engineering like flying buttresses, pointed arches, and ribbed vaulting meant that their walls could have significantly more windows and hence natural illumination, and this was an intentional feature. I'll explain how flying buttresses work, but the general idea of all three is similar: by being more judicious in the shapes of material, you can focus strength where it is more beneficial and remove it from where it is not.

At the most basic example, a building has walls and a roof, and the walls support themselves as well as the roof. This means that masonry walls are often somewhat pyramid-shaped, with walls much wider at their base than near the roof. This still is true to an extent (though we often instead now use masonry as a veneer rather than for support, so it would be less likely there), and even up to the creation of skyscrapers about a hundred years ago it's quite visible where for example the brick ground floor walls of a building will be many feet thick and taper significantly thinner upwards. This leaves very little or almost no space at all for windows, or if you did have them, they would be very deep and so let in very little light. At the higher levels where the wall is thinner, windows would be more likely.

The next improvement is to use buttresses. A buttress can be as simple as building something akin to a column right next to a wall. This gives the wall a lot more strength, especially against being pushed on its face. It also means that if you need a certain amount of vertical strength, like to support the roof, you could makes the wall thinner by moving some of its mass to these buttresses. You could use the same amount of masonry but now have a thinner wall in most spots while thicker in some spots. Now it's easier to make windows, but the walls do still need to be thick enough to support themselves. This isn't a new discovery, with examples of this going back thousands of years.

The Gothic brought about flying buttresses. To make a buttress fly you pull it away from the wall it supports and then reconnect it only at certain points, like an arch spanning from the buttress to the wall. This makes the walls thinner, because more of the structural load can be passed on to these external buttresses. Also by making the building lighter (in mass) you need less additional mass to support the lessened mass, so you get increasing benefits. It's now as if the building has an external skeleton carrying much of its weight, so it can be more free to express itself artistically. Windows are one prominent example of this, and their light was symbolic of the divine and important to have in the church as much as possible. The glass also served as a storytelling medium (as did painting and sculpture) where the windows could depict a biblical scene or have some meaning in addition to their beauty. Considering many people could not read the Bible, these served as illustrations of the text.

Ribbed vaulting and pointed arches have similar development ideas, but they're a little less straightforward to illustrate. Pointed arches transmit the loads more directly in the direction they are intended (mostly down, less sideways) than straight or circular arches. Basically pointed arches are more efficient at putting the weight where we want it to go by virtue of their shape alone. Ribbed vaulting judiciously reinforces the structure in specific portions that could benefit from it, without needing to reinforce the entire structure everywhere."
"Since you didn't specify a specific part of the medieval world, I can answer with one specific example of post-combat-looting from a topic I know a bit about; the Catalan Almogavers (mercenaries), and the Catalan expedition to the East.

&nbsp;

(Note: All of the information in this answer is based directly from a primary source on the matter; the chronicles of Ramon Muntaner, who was actually one of the leaders of the company. At the end of my post I have a citation for the translation I quote from)

&nbsp;

First, as a bit of background; the Catalan Almogavers were essentially mercenary companies of shock infantry made up of soldiers from the Crown of Aragon (most of the men in this group were Aragonese or Catalan). There were many groups of Almogavers, but the group I'll discuss here is often called **the great/grand Catalan company**. 

After the war of the Sicilian Vespers, the company, led by Roger de Flor took up service under the Byzantines to combat different Turkish groups in Anatolia. After finding great success, the Byzantines betrayed the group and had some of the group's leaders (including Roger de Flor) assassinated. 

This led to a series of intense battles between Byzantine forces and the greatly outnumbered Catalan Company.

&nbsp;

Luckily for us, one of the men in the Catalan company was Ramon Muntaner, who beyond being one of the group's leaders, was also the main man in charge of the treasury and book-keeping of the company. Even more luckily for the purpose of being able to write this answer, he is also considered to be one of the Crown of Aragon's most important chroniclers and chronicled much of the company's exploits.

In describing his role around the time of the biggest battles between the company and the Byzantines:

""I was also Chancellor and Treasurer of the army, and the army scribes were always by my side, so nobody but I knew how many there were in the army at any particular time. And I kept written records of how much each man received for a fully-armoured or lightly-armoured horse and for foot-soldiers likewise, in such manner that the spoils from the raids had to be divided up according to my book; from which raids, whether at sea or on land, I [meaning the treasury of the company] retained the fifth share."" (pg. 99)

Robert D. Hughes, the translator of the text I'm citing, adds in a footnote that what this meant is that the other four fifths of the loot was kept by those who had earned it.

&nbsp;

So then, how much loot did the Catalan Company earn? From what Muntaner describes, *a lot*. 

&nbsp;

Take for example the first major battle between the Catalan Company and the Imperial army. Muntaner does not give an exact number for the amount of men the company had in this battle, but from an entry a bit before the battle he had described a number of 1,462 (with 206 being horsemen). The first host of Imperial troops is described to have consisted of ""at least ten thousand horsemen and a good thirty thousand foot-soldiers"" (pg. 74). Muntaner describes the company as essentially driving them back repeatedly, until the Imperial army routed, at which point the Company chased them down in a slaughter for 24 miles (pg. 85).

Muntaner claims that from this battle, they killed ""a good six thousand horsemen and more than twenty thousand foot-soldiers.""

&nbsp;

As a non-expert in general medieval warfare myself, I don't know how embellished these numbers might be, but in any case, Muntaner makes it clear that the amount of loot gained from this battle was massive in comparison to the relatively meager amount of men they had with their company:

""What can I tell you? The gains that we made from that battle were so immense that they were beyond reckoning, for it too us a week to gather up the spoils. We needed only to remove gold and silver, since all the horsemen's belts and the swords and the saddles and the bridle-bits and all their armour were garnished with gold. And all of the there had been carrying money, the foot-soldiers likewise, and so the spoils were endless."" (pg. 85)

He goes on to describe that they also ""took a good three thousand horses that had survived... Thus we had so many horses that there were three for each one of us. "" (pg. 85) 

&nbsp;

Regardless of whether or not you believe the amounts of casualties listed by Muntaner, clearly the Company was well-endowed with wealth after this battle, and more like it followed. A brief description of the following major battle (also a win for the Company) reads: ""And we gathered up the spoils, taking away with us a good ten thousand carts - each of which was pulled by four buffaloes - and so much livestock that they covered the entire countryside. We had acquired countless spoils, much more than in the first battle."" (pg. 88)

Now while Muntaner doesn't give exact numbers in terms of how much loot exactly the average soldier gained in these battles, it's clear that the amount of loot flowing into the party was an immense amount; Muntaner points out that in horses alone, the amount they gained made it so that they had almost 3 horses for every fighting man (not that all men would necessarily be mounted in combat, but it still gives an idea of the wealth that the company gained).

&nbsp;

All that to say, that at least in the case of this particular mercenary company, the soldiers did get very rich from the loot. As far as your more specific questions concerning levied peasants, I have no knowledge, but I hopefully you find these excerpts from Muntaner's chronicle at least a bit interesting or insightful. I am not a historian myself but this is one of the few areas where I've read several sources, and your question brought this to mind.

Source: The Catalan Expedition to the East: from the Chronicle of Ramon Muntaner, translated by Robert D. Hughes, with an introduction by J. N. Hillgarth. Barcino/Tamesis, 2006.

Edit 1: Formatting for readability.

Edit 2: As people have pointed out, this doesn't really answer every part of the question. This is only one specific example, and even this example is lacking concrete records and exact numbers for how wealthy these soldiers would've been from their conquests. My hope is that it at least gives an idea of what a looting policy could look like for an army of medieval mercenaries, even if the numbers involved are almost certainly exaggerated by Muntaner. Beyond that, while I'm sure there are better examples, I thought that without any other answers I'd at least try share something tangentially/partially related that I do happen to know a bit about."
"> According to this article in the Journal of Ethnic foods, this is a popular theory but not true. This article cites a Nature article (hidden behind paywall) that concludes gochu , the quintessential pepper to Korean cuisine was likely brought to Korea by birds millions of years ago.

The Nature paper claims nothing of the sort. It simply gives experimental results showing that small mammals avoid eating chillies, i.e., that at least one function of capsaicin is to ensure that the fruits are eaten by birds, and thus dispersed by birds, rather than by mammals.

The article you link to is an example of nationalism trumping scientific/historical accuracy. The historical evidence is clear enough, and well supported by archaeology: the old ""hot"" spices were pepper (Piper nigrum) and Korean pepper (basically Japanese sansho and Sichuan pepper, Zanthoxylum piperitum and relatives), and ginger if you call that a ""hot"" spice. Later, Yi Sugwang, *Chibong yusol*, 1614, mentions them as a newly-introduced plant. The oldest Korean-language cookbook, *Eumsikdimibang*, dates from then (1610) (there are older Korean cookbooks, written in classical Chinese - this is the oldest surviving cookbook written in Korean), makes no use of chillies in its dishes. Later, they become important in Korean cuisine.

And it seems, in larger and larger amounts - the amount of chilli powder in kimchi has increased by a factor of 14 over the last century, accompanied by a significant reduction in ""hotness"" of the chillies. Just one of the many parts of the recent evolution of Korean cuisine.

From mostly the same authors, revisionist chilli history very badly argued on the basis of genetic evidence: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jef.2017.08.010"
"Quick follow-up: I couldn't help but notice the ship named Pickle... that seems like an almost joke name. Wikipedia references that the ship was previously named Sting, which seems more typical for a warship. 

Any insight into how it ended up with that name?"
"Off topic in regards to the history part, apologies if this is not the place: I always thought that the space navy theme grew out of the idea that humans were seen as colonizing space, much the same way Europeans colonized the world using ships. Also as the Earth's surface is mostly water and space is mostly, well, space the parallels were too hard to ignore. It took months and even years to go from the Old World to the New World and the same would have applied to space, magnified by the mind-boggling distances of course."
"Well, the word ""Abrahamic"" isn't as clear as you may think. Religious Studies professor Aaron Hughes wrote a book on the problems with the phrase Abrahamic religions, arguing:

> “Abrahamic religions” are [often]
assumed to consist of a set of essential characteristics that can be juxtaposed with other religions, be they “Eastern,” “pagan,” “new,” or “mixed”...[The usages of this term]  are used to illumine some deep, essential, or necessary trait that somehow makes them
unique from all other (“non-Abrahamic”) religions.

So if there's some essential core to what makes something an ""Abrahamic religion,"" we're probably not going to find it. The myth of Abraham would be a contender, but as Hughes points out, Abraham is not used here due to his supreme importance in the three religions you list (Moses is arguably more important to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). It's used to signal a ""familial"" heritage with Abraham (i.e. we Jews/Christians/Muslims are brothers with you because of our father Abraham). But Hughes (and other religious studies scholars) have pointed out that this is ahistorical and problematic in academic contexts. And the actual person of Abraham and his religion is not really helpful for answering your question, because scholars have questioned the historicity of the Abraham narrative in Genesis, and Judaism/Christianity/Islam are so different from what that would be.

So another way of taking your question is to interpret ""Abrahamic"" as being any religion that takes influence from either Judaism, or a religion that takes influence from Judaism (i.e. Christianity, Islam). If we're interpreting it this way, then the answer is yes. And some of them still exist! There are people who practice Rastafari, Druze, and the Bahai Faith. If you want to learn more about them, I definitely recommend looking up their current practices.

I could list more that fit this definition, but even still, the bounds start to break down. We run into problems like ""What is enough influence from Judaism/Christianity/Islam to fit?"" or even ""What is a religion?"" The latter refers to the slippery bounds of the concept of ""religion"" (William Cantwell Smith wrote a good book on this), but also the fact that it's not always easy to say where one religion ends and another begins.

For example, Greco-Roman religion and magical texts invoked foreign deities, and/or interpreted them as foreign equivalents of domestic deities. We have examples of pagans doing this with the Jewish Yahweh. Does that...make Greco-Roman religion Abrahamic? Again, one may retreat to finding some ""essential core"" to define Abrahamic religions so we can exclude Greco-Roman paganism, but many scholars would say this is a futile impulse. [Also, the point isn't that Greco-Roman religion *is* Abrahamic, but that ""Abrahamic"" may have to exist on a fuzzy spectrum that can't be sharply defined.]

But even if we can say ""No, obviously Greco-Roman religion can't be Abrahamic. If there's one thing that isn't Abrahamic, it has to be that."" There are still religions that you could still argue are ""Abrahamic,"" even though the label doesn't really fit. So, there are religions that take our definition of having foundationally been influenced by Judaism/Christianity/Islam. For example, Sikhism takes much influence from Islam, such as quoting Islamic poets in its main holy text, and even referencing Adam in its holy text. However, I've never seen anyone call Sikhism an ""Abrahamic religion."" And whether Muslims or Sikhs call it one can have more to do with the non-academic interfaith motivation of ""Abrahamic religions"" that I mentioned above.  American civil religion (cf Robert Bellah) has taken tremendous influence from Christianity. But is that an ""Abrahamic religion""? And here again, the bounds of where one religion ends and another begins becomes a difficult question. We can see more problems with discussing history and culture with a word like ""religion,"" which implies a certain amount of exclusivity and cohesion (the same applies to the Greco-Roman example).

However, there are religions that you could say fit our criteria, and could be seriously argued to be Abrahamic, in spite of rarely (if ever) being called Abrahamic. For some examples, Manichaeism takes a lot of influence from Christianity (Christ is one of the main figures in the religion). Yet, it's often seen as not being Abrahamic due to it also taking influence from Zoroastrianism and Buddhism.  Yezidis practice a religion that is very much influenced by Islam, yet they are also often excluded from being ""Abrahamic."" And finally, Santeria is a religion that undoubtedly takes much from Roman Catholicism, yet it is usually categorized as an ""African"" or ""African diasporic"" religion.

-------------

So in summation, yes. While both the bounds of ""religion"" and the categorization of ""Abrahamic"" are a lot more vague than some might think, there are more ""Abrahamic religions."" Some are pretty uncontroversial (e.g. Bahai), while some would be more controversial (e.g. Sikhism). If what you want is a jumping-off point to learn more about the influences that Judaism/Christianity/Islam have had on other religions, then some good things to look up would be: Iranian religions, Gnostic religions, African diasporic religions, the early history of Judaism, the history of Judaism in the Greco-Roman world, and ""religious syncretism"" in general (even though that is also a problematic term)."

Still, there does seem to be evidence that Europeans--even though they may have seen the decimation of the Native Americans as inevitable and/or foreordained--felt *bad* about it.   And even wanted to do something about it. 

Of course, there was the Aboriginal Protection Society, founded in England in 1837.  It's remarkable.. one of the first human rights organizations.   (It was an offshoot of the abolitionist/anti-slavery societies).   It's main agenda was to protect aboriginals (natives/primitives/noble savages, whatever the formulation) from European exploitation and abuse, whether in Australia or Canada.   While it could be quite smugly self-superior (and often racist) in its thinking... what European *wasn't* these things in the 1840s?  It was founded primarily by Quakers (who the world owes a lot to, by the way.) 

But a more interesting (and less well-known) dynamic is between **Germans** (even before there was a ""Germany"") and Native Americans. 

The really interesting work here is Glenn Penny's *Kindred by Choice*... which has an argument right in the title.  Many Germans, looking abroad, saw and found and even *felt* a certain kinship with Native Americans.  This continues to this day, with huge German Native-American reenactments still popular (with costumes, living in teepees, beadwork, learning languages like Lakota, performing customs, etc.)   

But Penny shows that this began long before the 20th century, going back even to the late 18th century. Germans (perhaps inspired by their own self-image reflected in Tacitus' *Germania*?) felt a real identification with decentralized, noble, doomed (?) people who were up against the larger forces of ""civilization.""   Penny charts the ins-and-outs of this German feeling of kindship with Native Americans over hundreds of years.  

--> Very importantly, Penny argues that Germans were among the first Europeans to widely recognize and discuss the genocide of the Native Americans *as* a genocide. (Though of course that exact word was not used, having been coined only in the mid-20th century).  

It was such the case that when a town of German settlers in Minnesota was massacred by eastern Sioux (in the Dakota Uprising of 1862), many Germans back in the various German principalities sympathized NOT with their fellow ""Germans"" who were massacred, but with the ""Indians"" who carried out the massacre.  (!!)  The Indians were portrayed in German newspapers as having been forced into this by ruthless white pressure.    This is extraordinary.

And where other historians have seen great irony or even malicious duplicity in Germans' deep pain and horror at the eradication of the Native American culture... given Germany's genocide of Jews and others 1939-45 and even the less well-known genocide of Herero and Nama in Southwest Africa 1904-07..... Penny does not share these views.  He holds that history is not foreordained:  that Germans could point an accusatory finger at American genocide in 1860s (again, not termed that)...  but gleefully commit it themselves decades later, in the 1940s (and 1900s), without there being a fundamental contradiction or even necessarily a connection. 

Personally, I think Penny pushes his argument too far, and perhaps romanticizes the *Germans'* romanticization a bit too much... I mean, some of the German view of Native Americans strikes me as almost fetishization.  It strikes me as... well... weird.  Still, Penny challenges us to think about long-standing ways of writing about things as actual positive affinities, not just empty rhetoric that covers settler expansion.  Penny's is a good book.  

In short, Mary Shelley wrote at a really pivotal time for a number of historical developments.  A lot of her themes--whether science run amok, the educability of 'monsters', the responsibility of creators for their creations, the importance of nature, the true origin of evil deeds--were really at the forefront of thinking of the time.  But she was also a popularizer of them.  

So, too, with her engendering sympathy for the plight of Native Americans.  She was both at the forefront of showing sympathy--even emotional pain--at the recognition of the atrocities committed against Native Americans.  But she was also distilling long-standing themes that went back two thousand years, and popularizing them for contemporary readers.  

Ultimately, did many Europeans share this sympathetic outlook... even to the point of criticizing United States and even European policies and perceptions?

yes. 

and no. 

But yes.  

sort of. 

Hope this helps."
"I think it is also worth pointing out that, unlike the usual perception of Eastern European fascination with Adidas  track suits (and, possibly, a perception that the OP has), Adidas track suits were not universally worn by everyone in Eastern Europe. They are/were a marker of a specific stratum of society -- mobs in the 90s and ""gopniks"" in the 90s and 00s. No ""regular"" person would be religiously wearing an Adidas tracksuit outside sporting (or related) activities. Or no ""regular"" person would ever think of an Adidas tracksuit as a status symbol, for that matter. In fact, Adidas became a pretty stigmatised brand because of this association."

In the Middle East, the power of anti-Israeli governments was waning. The Gulf War of 1991 had dealt a serious blow against Iraq, one of Israel's staunchest opponents. \[Unfortunately, I couldn't find a good enough source to speak on the effects of the Gulf War for resolution 46/86 in more detail.\] After the UN stepped up its anti-Zionist stance in the late 70s, especially with the 1978 First World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination in Geneva that condemned what it saw as the ""existing and increasing relations between the Zionist State of Israel and the racist regime of South Africa\[,\]"" it backed away in the 80s and 90s due to a changing geopolitical climate. Speaking of South Africa: by 1991, the UN had taken a position hostile to apartheid, adopting several resolutions in the 1980s calling for an end to racial discrimination in South African society. Ending apartheid was no longer the insurmountable task it seemed in the 1970s. The vicious practice formally ended in 1994, just three years after the UN struck anti-Zionism from its record. The African states that lobbied so fervently for resolution 3379 had gained some ground with the UN and the international community in the fight against apartheid, and the Soviet Union couldn't provide the leverage that African states used in 1975. It was a different time. The levers states could pull in the 70s had stopped working.

Tensions between Israel, Palestine, and the Middle East at large have not gone away. If anything, they have recently intensified. But like so many international events during the Cold War, the UN's condemnation of Zionism was not solely driven by local and regional politics, history, and struggles. The world's superpowers cast a long shadow over the Levant, and parties interested in conflicts elsewhere saw an opportunity to grow their stature in Geneva and make progress on the issues that mattered to them. ""Global opinion"" did not really exist. Large groups of nations can sometimes align, but they rarely do so for a single, unified purpose. Resolution 3379 faced stern opposition from the very start. Israel and its allies saw it as anti-Semitic and a demonstration of Soviet influence from day one; supporters, however, saw it as a necessary step to advance the UN's goal of eliminating all forms of racial discrimination on the basis of ethnicity. But as apartheid approached its end and the Soviet bear went into hibernation, supporting resolution 3379 stopped making sense for many of the states that voted for it in '75. Even Egypt, Kuwait, and Oman -- states that had vocally opposed and even waged war against Israel in the 70s and 80s -- decided not to show up. Their absence said about as much as any vote could. 

Soviet foreign minister Boris Pankin said it best: the anti-Zionist resolution was a ""relic of the ice age."" The world had changed so much in such little time.

Sources linked in text. If a historian reads my comment and breaks out into hives, please feel free to reply and correct me."
"Let's start with beef, since the patty is the easiest part here, and also the most important part of the burger. The romans absolutely had beef. There are dozens of references to beef throughout greek and roman literature. In the odyssey, Odysseus kills some sacred cattle, and cooks the meat. I'm sure that in a big city like rome, it would be easy to come across some beef. Grinding beef by hand might be hard, but I'm sure our McRoman can pull it off, considering his need for a delicious burger. You can do that with a decent knife, but it'll be an absolute pain. 

Next, we need cheese. Pliny, in his *Natural History* (XI, 96-97) talks about cheese. In chapter 97, he lists off a bunch of kinds of cheese, but what sounds good to me is his comment that ""Goats also produce a cheese which has been of late held in the highest esteem, its flavour being heightened by smoking it."" Smoked goat cheese would be nice on a burger, if a little off from traditional McDonalds. 

Our greens are next. Onion is also mentioned in Pliny's text. IN book XIX, chapter 32, Pliny talks about onions. He mentions a few varieties of onions. The onions of Crete are known for ""the sweetness of their flavour."" Sweet onion is my preferred burger onion, so let's hope our McRoman can find that. However, he can certainly find some kind of onion. We're doing good!

Now for Lettuce. Once again, we're in luck! The romans ate lots of lettuce, and once again, Pliny has us covered. Chapter 38 of the same book is all about lettuce. He describes a bunch of lettuces, including one so large it could be used for a small garden gate! The footnotes in the translation seem to indicate this might be Sessile, or romaine lettuce, so we'll go with that. However, any lettuce will do here, so let's not worry too much about that. We got lettuce! 

Pliny disappoints here with pickles. Despite devoting Chapters 2 - 5 of Book 20 to cucumbers as a medicine, and chapter 23 of book XIX to cucumbers as something to grow in your garden, Pliny doesn't actually mention that you can pickle cucumbers anywhere I saw. Columella' *de re rustica* (on agriculture), however, does. He states that you mix up ""hard brine,"" which is heavily saturated saltwater, and vinegar (which was made from wine and spices), and then you add cucumbers and all kinds of other stuff. Your pickles will be giving your burger a real funky taste. 

Mustard seed is also mentioned in Pliny. Apicus mentions mustard as well, and wants everyone to use it all the time. I didn't feel like crawling through more translations for all this, so I just went out and found someone else's adaptation of Apicus's mustard recipe. I linked it down below. The recipe is going to make a stone ground, strong flavored mustard. It's got some whole seeds, and is probably closest to modern brown mustard. This is strong artisanal stuff, so again with the funky taste and strong burger. 

Bread is going to be expensive at the least. Modern flour is of great quality, historically speaking. Only the finest flour would have been fine and white. Off in Book XVIII, Chapter 26, Pliny talks about bread and risen bread. He says that ""At the present day, however, the leaven is prepared from the meal that is used for making the bread. For this purpose, some of the meal is kneaded before adding the salt, and is then boiled to the consistency of porridge, and left till it begins to turn sour."" That's sourdough - they have a starter culture, and then they would use it. It's not fed and kept like a modern sourdough culture, but it is decent starter yeast. The flavor from it will be inconsistent, and you'll probably have some grit from the grinding, but if your McRoman shills out all the cash he can, he'll get decent sourdough bread. This will not be a neutral flavored bun, and it's not going to look great. But you could buy some sort of small loaf at a bakery, so at least we have a bun. 

Sesame seeds are also not the hardest. It's an old crop, and a quick search pulled up a JSTOR result on how the ""seed was well known to ancient greek and roman authors."" I'm sure our Ronald McRoman could walk on down to the market and buy a little thing of sesame seeds if needed. So he just needs to pay the baker to put a bunch of sesame seeds on the nicest small loaf he has before he bakes it. Easy peasy!

The romans would have had frying pans and griddles. The Royal Ontario museum of archeology has an article they published in the American Journal of Archaeology, which I found reproduced on The University of Chicago's website. It includes a number of illustrations of Frying pans and Griddles. They look not bad for frying. 

In summary: Yes. we're going to burger town. But it's going to be gourmet, and not what we're used to. The biggest issue will be the beef, which is going to be a pain to butcher into ground beef. But it won't be that off from what you might get in a fancy hipster restaurant. I dunno how much this might all cost, sorry.

"Let me take you back to 1995.

Russia was out of money.

This was not an unusual thing -- as the Soviet Union fell apart things
got so bad with the space program [there were (untrue) rumors they
were going to sell the Mir](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hn8xnf/the_mir_space_station_was_in_orbit_from_1986_to/fxgzdr6/),
and later in the 90s (after money from a US space partnership ran out) they hawked space pens for QVC and got conned
by a ""British businessman"" with a non-existent company.

But in 1995, Russia was _really_ out of money. The IMF and World Bank were tapped out for loans. That's where ""loans for shares""
happened, and by no coincidence at all, exactly the year where ""Russian oligarch"" starts appearing together as a phrase. Before
that, the word's association was more loose, and if you meant anything by default in the 1980s, it was probably the government
of Haiti.

It wasn't necessarily that oligarchs didn't exist before that point in Russia, but they weren't quite recognized as such yet. Going back to the
failed coup of 1991 and solidification of Yeltsin as leader of Russia, the journalist Yevgenia Albats later said in an interview:

>I was running around Moscow on the last night of the coup, August 21. The city was dark. There were a lot of people on the streets. And I remember this very strong feeling that I lived through the best days of my life. Absolutely. It was such a great sense of victory, probably the first time in my journalistic life that I felt so tied to the people of the streets, and this amazing feeling--we did it.

Behind the scenes, those in power soon after

>... were involved in dividing offices that formerly belonged to the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and deciding who was going to get the crystal plates and china.

The seeds for this were set even earlier, during Communism. The attempts to make central planning rational were falling apart. The mathematician Naishul
at Gosplan tells of complex mathematical models in the 1970s where after the work was done and an answer was given on such-and-such a decision,
those in charge simply modified the answers to what they wanted. Factory managers lobbied and pulled for resources, and as the Soviet Union
came closer and closer to collapse, the managers tugged harder and acquired more power, where the trading and dealing essentially took over.

When Gorbechev in the late 80s reached for openness, the future oligarchs started their journey. Just picking one at
random, Mikhail Fridman started a cooperative selling photography chemicals, and using the money from
that enterprise, eventually was a founder of Alfa-Bank (with Petr Aven) in January 1991, before the coup.

The company lasted past the coup and Fridman gained in power until he became known as Semibankirschina, one
of the ""seven bankers"" in Yeltsin's inner circle:

>...they control the access to budget money and basically all investment opportunities inside the 
country. They own the gigantic information resource of the major TV channels. They form the President's 
opinion. Those who didn't want to walk along them were either strangled or left the circle.

The ""loans-for-shares"" of 1995 was proposed by one of the bankers (Potanin of UNEXIM Bank) which was essentially
a hyper-privatization scheme. The government still owned a great many assets in various companies,
and there was a series of auctions that were essentially a direct fraud, with very undervalued
assets being traded for the instant cash Yeltsin needed. (To be fair, again: this was desperate
circumstance, and some people had gone without salaries for months by this point.)

There was a last gasp of an attempt at reform in 1998 -- when the economy was still dipping, and so
were Yeltsin's poll numbers -- that was far too late. Yeltsin tried to hand off economic development
from one of the oligarchs (Chernomyrdin) to the reform-minded politician Sergei V. Kiriyenko, but, as noted by Gregory Freidin in the article ""Yeltsin Yields to the Oligarchs"":

>...the moment of truth came when the oligarchs found out about Kiriyenko's plans to pull the plug on several major banks. The Central Bank was supposed to take them over and auction them off to the highest bidder (probably some financial institution in 
the West, given the cash-strapped Russian economy). Threatened with the loss of their property, the oligarchs last weekend put the screws on Yeltsin. He caved and passed the reins back to Chernomyrdin, the principal draft horse of the energy and financial interests.

Yeltsin winning the election in 1998 required airdropping in so much money that the government and the oligarchs were intertwined. Yeltsin's single-digit poll numbers were
such a liability and caused so much pressure that he finally resigned at the end of 1999, ahead of the next election, [handing over power to Putin](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/world/yeltsin-resigns-overview-yeltsin-resigns-naming-putin-acting-president-run-march.html).

>Mr. Putin, 47, is the latest and most popular of a string of prime ministers Mr. Yeltsin had appointed in hopes of finding a malleable and viable successor. Since his appointment in August, Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. official, has become Russia's most popular politician because of his tough-minded conduct of the war in Chechnya.

...

Postscript: The word does get applied to other countries, it is just the circumstances of Russia were so extreme it became almost sacrosanct. Jeffrey Winters argues in his 2011 book _Oligarchy_ that Singapore and the United States both count as ""Civil Oligarchies"", but that's starting to get into political science, and we're in the wrong venue for that.

So I would really like to see clearer quotes attributing the term curb-chain to the strap on the hat, in a non-equestrian context.  As it is this seems like misattribution of unclear terminology."
"How many men were killed from digging itself?

From a British Army point of view, it'd be very difficult to attain that figure, given how inextricable the *daily and ongoing* task of digging, improving and repairing trench systems was with the actual tactical task of holding an assigned section of line. Note that I'm completely omitting *tunneling* from this, as a) it's not an area I can provide an answer on, and b) you seemed to be asking more about combat at ground level rather than combat 10 metres underground.

When holding the line and improving the line are viewed to be one and the same thing, the daily reports and returns on casualties from front line units back to Brigade and Divisional staffs inevitably reported enemy action in general terms, then simply listed casualties arising from the day's activities as  part of the fact.

To highlight the point between the non-distinction between the difficulties of digging and also holding the line generally (be it ""on the line"", ""in reserve"" or ""resting""), Richard Holmes quotes a Second Lieutenant Edwin Underhill of his experiences near Ploegsteert Wood near Ypres in 1915 (Underhill would later be promoted and die at Thiepval whilst serving with 8th Battalion Loyal North Lancs during the Battle of the Somme) -

>... I took 150 men to do drainage work under the REs on the communication trenches on the left of where we were before we came out. It was an endless, hopeless task. The walls had caved in in places, and as soon as the muck was cleared out it caved in again, and it all had to be done again.... All the time we were working this morning, shells were bursting every now and then. And they were unpleasantly close too.

Basically put, if you were being shelled, and you were buried whilst digging, casualties were invariably attributed to the enemy shell that either directly (or indirectly by weaking the structure and the soil around it) buried the men doing the digging.

How often were men buried due to trenches being blown in or losing their structural integrity due to incoming artillery?

Often enough that such events litter official and unofficial unit histories of British and Dominion units. The unofficial history of the 11th Battalion AIF, ""Legs Eleven"" by Captain Walter C Belford, refers to either the burying of personnel or the disinterring of corpses by artillery no less than 8 times when describing the experience of the Battalion at one battle alone.

Captain Belford highlights your exact point about just how deadly a volume of earth can be when describing the Battalion's experience at being shelled for the entire day on 24 July 1916.

>This shelling was constant and well directed, with many of these shells landed on the newly dug trenches, making large craters and often burying many of the troops. Some of the boys managed to struggle out, others were rescued by their mates; but many who had dug themselves only too well in were completely buried by the great upheavals of earth.

Putting aside the second type of main trench that the BEF used at the start of the war (the largely above-ground revetments that are less relevant to your question), it's also difficult to ascertain casualty figures for trenches built under the ground level because of the method used to build trenches in most tactical scenarios.

Whilst this isn't by any means the only way a ""line"" was established, two pretty common ways of establishing a trench line were firstly advancing to a point and digging in, with the second being prosecuting an advance and taking over a set of positions or portion of the enemy's line before going through the difficult and brutal process of integrating it into your line and segregating it from the rest of the enemy's line.

In the first method, once a unit was given an order to ""Dig in"", groups of soldiers in 2's and 3's would proceed to dig ""posts"", essentially foxholes to provide immediate cover. Once these were dug, the soldiers would proceed to dig laterally to basically join up posts into a continuous line, which would then be integrated into the existing line via the construction of saps (perpendicular trench lines) and communication trenches. Whilst the unit that is digging in is doing so, other sister units that are ""in reserve"" or assigned as carrying parties that are ""in combat"" (but were not tasked with the direct assault) are bringing up construction materials - revetments, corrugated iron, wooden boards, frames, pickets and barbed wire - anything and everything that would make the new trenchline structurally sound and defensible enough to occupy in the short term as the tactical situation required. If the situation dictated that a given section of the line would be needed on an ongoing basis, there'd be time to reinforce it as part of the regular cycle of units moving in between support, reserve and front line trenches (new or old) as they cycled through a respective tour of the line.

The second method generally involved the capture of enemy posts (or even parts of trench system that were already established), and clearing the enemy of the immediate area around the captured positions (and ensuring that any counter-attacks were beaten off). Once that was done, the exact same process to convert and integrate the new position as the first method can be undertaken (construction and improvement of interconnecting saps and communications trenches) to integrate the new line.

The reality was that integrating a new stretch of line was a pretty significant undertaking (aerial photos of some portions of the western front look more like a chessboard than a two sets of vaguely parallel trench systems), as was maintaining existing trenches which would be intermittently subject to enemy artillery and mortar fire to varying degrees of frequency and impact depending on how active the sector was at the time. It was for this reason that units in ""Rest"" or ""Reserve"" were often doing anything but resting, and were often engaged in backbreaking labour.

In either of those scenarios, the act of digging actually becomes somewhat synonymous with combat or enemy action - under those circumstances it becomes pretty understandable why the distinction of a casualty due ""purely to digging a trench"" doesn't really get much traction, especially when the need to structurally reinforce trenches that needed to be establish beyond a line of outposts (and indeed these looser tactical arrangements were also often used, especially when holding lines ""in-depth"") was already very well understood by planners and commanders from the first months of the war.

In summary

1. How were trenches dug without collapsing on the men digging them?

Basically it became necessary for assault forces to include carrying parties, engineers, and ""troops in reserve"" that would essentially work to deliver the necessary structural reinforcement to the lines as the lines were established or consolidated.

2) Were the casualties from these engineering endeavours significant?

Yes, but unfortunately due to the tactical environment that these construction and maintenance efforts were undertaken in, it's nearly impossible to determine what the casualties were for men who died *just* by the act of digging, mainly because of the often continuous nature of the combat occurring around them whilst they dug. Certainly I've never seen British or Dominion sources make the distinction.

3) What about the Tunneling Companies Mr NotAWittyFucker? They did a lot of Digging!

They sure did, Billy. Seriously, that's a subject worthy of it's own post, and one I'm regrettably not as familiar with or have resources to provide an authoritative answer. I'll let someone else answer that one if you're interested."

Do we know how common/organized that kind of human sacrifice actually was? As in, sacrificing Romans on the spot, right after a battle? I know human sacrifice wasn’t all that uncommon at the time but I get the impression a Roman writer might have been interested in making their enemies as brutally over-the-top and villainous as possible so it’s hard to tell."
"So, the ""500 years of Swiss neutrality"" has been disputed as a historical myth invented in the 19th century, a sort of ""invented tradition"".

In his 1983 essay volume edited together with Terence Ranger, Eric Hobsbawm describes that a lot of traditions we today associate with being old, handed down for generations etc. are invented, mostly in the service of nationalism in the 19th century and only claim to be much older than that. As they remark, ""modern nations and all their impedimenta generally claim to be the opposite of novel, namely rooted in remotest antiquity, and the opposite of constructed, namely human communities so 'natural' as to require no definition other than self-assertion."" and that also applies to many a symbol or practice associated with that new nation and national sentiment. From supposedly ancient Scottish clan tartans that were introduced in the 19th century to the martial arts of Japan, the nationalist movement lies at the base for a lot of these supposedly ancient traditions and symbols.

This also applies to the idea of Swiss neutrality since the 16th century since that narrative was created in the 19th century under specific historical circumstances to which I'll get in a minute.

To start off with the traditional narrative: It is generally held that the old Swiss Confederacy (Eidgenossenschaft) adopted neutrality after the battle of Marignano in Lombardy when Swiss mercenaries fought against France in the battle for rule over Northern Italy and suffered a terrible defeat where the Swiss mercenaries suffered between 8000 and 10000 casualties. The exact politics behind the battle are complicated and not exactly my expertise but what is important is that the troops of the Swiss confederacy fought against the French who desired control over Northern Italy. The battle had far reaching consequences: It ended all expansionist politics of the old Swiss Confederacy, showed that mercenaries were not the best way to fight wars anymore and forced the Confederacy to sign a peace treaty with France that put the Swiss Confederacy under the cultural and political influence of France. Within the Confederacy it ended a period of communal foreign policy that had been difficult to maintain even beforehand, mainly because of the religious split of the various cantons.

When Marignano is cited today the prevailing narrative behind it is that the defeat was so terrible that from it grew the policy of Swiss Neutrality that was maintained basically until up to today. But that narrative has actually little basis. The way it came about shows the intentions behind it:

Modern Swiss Neutrality has its origins in the Vienna Congress of 1815 when the European powers after having defeated Napoleon agreed that it was sensible to have a neutral Switzerland in their midst. France and Austria originally planned for Switzerland to become a satellite state while Prussia wanted to integrate it in the German Bund. Because there were so many plans and so many competing interests, these powers ultimately agreed for Switzerland to remain neutral and thus the modern legal concept of state neutrality was born.

As most of the people familiar with Switzerland know, it is a rather hands off state and was especially so during the 19th century. In the latter half of that century, it also became a safe haven for people forced to flee other European countries because of their political views (probably the most famous example being Lenin). Now when Bismarck in Germany passed his famous ""Socialist Laws"". which outlawed socialist, communist and social democratic political activity, many German socialists and communists fled to Switzerland in order to escape persecution.

Because Switzerland did not invest too much in police observing these socialists as well as other left-wingers from Russia and France, various European powers started to send spies in order to keep tabs on the various left-wing politicians and activists. One of these spies, a German named August Wohlgemuth was arrested in the Canton Aargau in 1889 and charged with espionage. This lead to an open political conflict with Bismarck. He demanded the release of Wohlgemuth and rallied his allies behind him. Germany, Russia, and Austria send diplomatic notes to Bern threatening to nullify the statue of Swiss neutrality from 1815 should Switzerland refuse to keep tabs on the political exiles in accordance with their demands. The gist was: Neutrality was a gift from the European powers and as such it could rescinded whenever they wished.

This did not go down well in Switzerland. Enter Paul Schweizer, state archivist of Zürich and historian. Publishing a nine part series in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) in 1889 – which would later become the core of his monumental monography on the subject of Swiss neutraltiy – he started out to oppose the idea that Swiss neutrality was something bestowed upon the Swiss by the European powers but rather something that had a massive deal of history behind it. Because he had virtually no legal argument at his hands, he advanced a historical one that was build upon the idea of imbuing Swiss neutrality with legitimacy independent of  the European powers because of its long and storied (and in many ways not really well-founded) history. As Andreas Suter argued, the idea that Switzerland in the early modern period was a neutral country was ""at its core a response to a monumental foreign policy crisis and a threat by the European powers"".

Following Schweizer's publication and his monograph, the idea of Marignano being the origin of Swiss neutrality that had since been strictly maintained took hold and until this day plays a central role in Swiss political discourse.

However, historiography has long contested the myth of Marignano and neutrality. Emil Usteri in his book *Marignano. Die Schicksalsjahre 1515/1516 im Blickfeld der historischen Quellen.* was the first one to call the narrative into question by re-examining the historical sources following the battle and finding no evidence of a decision to become neutral. In recent years Andreas Suter, Swiss historian at the German university of Bielefeld, has published a lot concerning this question providing further prove that the idea of 500 years of Swiss neutrality is an invented tradition of the late 19th century.

"Was Duke playing off Reagan's usage of ""Let's Make America Great Again""?"
"Yes, the current consensus is that the Hanging Gardens existed. Or, we know at least that the Assyrian kings did build extravagant gardens and could devise very elaborate, technologically advanced watering systems, as described by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Philo of Byzantium. But, the classical and cuneiform sources provide many different, sometimes conflicting, details about the existence of various royal gardens. I'm personally a bit dubious whether there ever existed the ONE Hanging Gardens of Babylon: the classical literary traditions might be a conflation of a number of different stories about royal gardens in the East. But, Stephanie Dalley, a now retired assyriologist from Oxford University who has written [a book](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Mystery_of_the_Hanging_Garden_of_Bab.html?id=6IUivLRnGC0C&redir_esc=y) and various articles about the Gardens, has come up with a nice theory for the location of the Gardens that does reconcile the classical tradition somewhat with the archaeological evidence - although her theory does (and probably will) remain unproven.

Dalley thinks the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were located at the Palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh. Her reason for thinking that the Gardens never actually existed at Babylon is that many generally reliable classical authors, who describe Babylon to some length and who should be interested in exactly this sort of marvels, such as Herodotus (I.181), Xenophon (in *Cyropaedia*), or Pliny the Elder (*Nat. Hist.* VI. 123) never mention any gardens - even though they do describe the magnificent walls of the city. And, even more seriously, archaeological finds or cuneiform sources in Babylon give no signs of the Gardens. Notably, king Nebuchadnezzar, to whom the wonder was attributed by classical authors, says nothing about any gardens in the abundant inscriptions that record his building-works in the city. The famous classical descriptions of the gardens, from which we know them, come from:   

1. Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC), an engineer who wrote technical treatises, described the watering system of the gardens to some length; but we do not know what is his source.   
2. Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC, 10.1-6) quoting Ctesias of Cnidus, a c. 400 BC historian of Persia and Assyria; Ctesius’ works are lost but he’s generally considered a somewhat unreliable source.    
3. The geographer Strabo (1st century AD, XVI 1.5), who according to his own words based his account of Persia in e.g. written eyewitness stories of the officers of Alexander the Great. It’s not clear who is his source for the Garden of Babylon.  
4. The Jewish author Josephus (1st century AD, *Contr. Apion.* I 19-20; *Antiquities of the Jews* X 11.1), saying that he has based his knowledge on Berossus, a Babylonian priest who apparently wrote history in Greek in 3rd century BC; Josephus’ account is thus often considered the most legit     
5. Quintus Curtius Rufus (1st century AD, *History of Alexander* V 1.35), who’s description of the garden is thought to rely on Clitarchus, a late 4th century BC historian who compiled his own *History of Alexander* from contemporary eye-witness sources.  

There is an extremely handy [website](http://www.plinia.net/wonders/gardens/hg22.html) that has collected together all the classical sources in English translation. So, the thing to note here is that none of these people writing about the Garden of ’Babylon’ had ever visited Babylon, not to mention Persia, expect perhaps Philo, of whose life we know nothing. And, they’re writing about the old history and geography of a distant region, the languages of which they could not themselves speak; it’s a game of Chinese whispers in Greek, Aramaic, Old Persian, and cuneiform… Classical authors regularly conflate or are mislead by their indigenous sources and get details about both the Persian past and present wrong. For example, Josephus attributed the Gardens to Nebuchadnezzar, but he was also the most famous ancient Mesopotamian king known in classical antiquity who just becomes a short-hand for ”famous Eastern king who did lots of stuff”: quite a number of things that he never historically did get attributed to him in classical tradition. The Greeks also understood the history of Mesopotamia within a faulty framework of three successive monarchies, Assyria, Media, and Persia, completely omitting the Neo-Babylonian kingdom (which Nebuchadnezzar ruled), so they often keep getting names and successive rules of Eastern monarchs wrong. The Greek and Jewish tradition weren’t very good at keeping track of names of Eastern cities: they specifically mix up Nineveh and Babylon, something that also happens in the Biblical texts (e.g. II Chronicles 33:11 says that Assyrians took Manasseh captive to Babylon, which was at the time a ruin; it ought to say Nineveh).

So, it’s not difficult to accept that the classical tradition just got the location of the Gardens wrong. Dalley then further goes onto identify Nineveh as the location of the Gardens and the king of Assyria Sennacherib (705 BC to 681 BC) as their builder. One of the main reasons for this is that Sennacherib describes at length in his records that he commissioned engineering works to bring mountain water to Nineveh, in order to provide water for drinking and for a garden that he had built. There’s also an architectural relief in Nineveh by Sennacherib’s grandson Assurbanibal, which shows a lavish garden: [picture of the sculpture](http://cdn.biblicalarchaeology.org/wp-content/uploads/nineveh-garden.jpg), and here’s a [drawing](http://www.bibelwissenschaft.de/fileadmin/buh_bibelmodul/media/wibi/image/sw_WILAT_Paradies_2.jpg)where it’s a bit easier to see what’s going on. 

Sennacherib's garden has for long been considered as a sort of ’proto-type’ of the Hanging Gardens, but Dalley thinks we should in fact consider them as *the* Hanging Gardens. We should note that the Greek description for ’hanging’ gardens does not imply the same as the English, i.e. plants with their roots higher than the actual leaves and top. A close reading of the sources could indeed support a garden like the one described in the sculpture relief: a naturalistic landscape rising up in tiers ""like a (Greek) theatre"" (Diodorus Siculus): forest trees are planted in it in terraced levels, and water is brought into the garden along an aqueduct which is incorporated into the terracing. There’s also a decorative pavilion or small palace in the relief, which might correspond to the ""royal lodges of every description"" which Diodorus mentioned. The only issue is that there’s no devices of raising water in huge quantities to the garden, just how ”streams of water emerging from elevated sources flow partly in a straight line down sloping channels” (Philo). But, the relief is broken in the middle, and it’s possible that the picture did show some water-raising device, too.

So, [here’s](http://imgur.com/a/MN5dc) artist Terry Ball’s picture of the ’Hanging Gardens of Babylon’ based on Dalley’s instructions and the Nineveh relief. 

Dalley further backs up her argument by noting that Sennacherib conquered and destroyed Babylon to shambles during his rule, rendering the city completely deserted for some seven years; so, technically he was the ’king of Babylon’. And, Dalley thinks there might be some evidence that during this time Nineveh as Sennacherib’s capital was considered as ’New Babylon’, further explaining the later confusion. This is possible, but all this is bit shaky proof for Nineveh as the definite location for the Gardens. The Nineveh theory is mainly based on that sculptural relief, and it’s easy to make the literary descriptions and the very scarce historical evidence we have to fit the picture when we want to make it happen, considering how much room for speculation there is. Her theory is lovely and certainly works, but we should note that there were other lavish gardens in Mesopotamia that might have just as well been the source of the classical tradition; the kings quite liked bragging about gardens and engineering works in public inscriptions. For example, the banquet stela of Assurnasirpal II from Nimrud described his engineering works that brought mountain water to his garden at Nimrud, and the huge party he held when the work was completed, entertaining more than 69,000 people with extravaganza. 

TL;DR: Some gardens definitely did exist in Mesopotamia; to what extent they were THE Gardens of Babylon, is open to interpretation.

"Fantastic answer, thanks! The bit about bodyguards being seen as an affectation for for monarchs is just the kind of detail I was hoping to hear, because from everything I've ever read, European and Asian monarchs had extensive bodyguards going well back into the the Renaissance (and likely further), so it's not like the idea that the ruler of a nation at war needed protection from assassination was a new idea!

Also, it's very interesting to me that Grant would have had 24 hour security, but Lincoln didn't. I wonder if that's indicative of a divide people had back then between the propriety of targeting a civilian versus a military leader?"

"Hey there!  I don't know that I qualify as an expert, but as an architect who loves and has studied Japanese architecture a good bit I'll try and provide some background for your question.  

>Was there a purpose or meaning behind this feature?

So two things here.  For purpose we must consider the practicality of such a feature and Japanese domestic life at the time.  For meaning we must consider aesthetic and spiritual matters in Japanese domestic life at the time.  

On the practicality side of things, consider that in the 1500's there was no indoor plumbing.  It seems like an obvious statement but when you need to get your water from either a nearby above ground water source or a well, having it immediately at hand in your home would be super convenient.  I have to admit here that it's been years since I've seen Seven Samurai and I don't recall the feature you're mentioning, so I'm kind of presuming off of what I know about traditional home design, but was the creek in the kitchen or the living space?  Generally homes were built up off the ground except for some spaces like the kitchen which would be on the ground with a dirt floor.  Having a creek pass through here would be simple and useful.  

Now, if the creek were in the living space it is less likely that it was a practical feature so much as an aesthetic one, and aesthetics were a *big deal* back then.  To understand traditional Japanese homes you first need to understand the term Wabi Sabi.  Wabi Sabi was an aesthetic philosophy that grew up after the introduction of Buddhism in Japan which celebrated the beauty of things like decay, loneliness, etc.  I know that sounds grim, it wasn't really viewed that way.  It had to do with a recognition of the impermanence of all things, a reverence for self-sacrifice in the name of spiritual awakening, and a respect for nature.  In Wabi Sabi, a mug that is irregular/warped and the color of natural clay would be prized above a perfectly round mug glazed in the latest fashions of China (and make no mistake, some of the drive for Wabi Sabi was a nationalistic response to cultural influence from China).  A Wabi Sabi philosopher might love and appreciate a particular half-decayed leaf they come upon in the right context, or the patina slowly overcoming a bronze bell, etc.  The loneliness aspect too was meant to embody the image of a monk living in a rough cabin in the woods away from society, finding peace and deliverance in nature; rather than a more sort of despondent loneliness.  Per Buddhism, it's about appreciation and acceptance of the world around you rather than trying to impose your will over it.  So back to an aesthetic indoor creek - this would serve as a constant reminder of Wabi Sabi, reflecting both the constant passage of time (you can never step in the same creek twice) and serving as an indoor reminder of the natural world.  

>Seems like it would be quite cold in the winters.

This has a related answer to the above when you further examine how Japanese homes were made and lived in.  Part of the acceptance of decay and nature wrapped into Wabi Sabi is an acceptance and appreciation for discomfort.  The traditional Japanese house is generally made of a wood frame with thin wood walls.  In richer examples, the wood would be expertly crafted and the walls would consist of a row of doors with paper screens, called Shoji, that could be opened or even completely removed to appreciate the outdoors and gardens surrounding the house.  In poorer areas as can be seen in the movie, the walls would be maybe rough wood plank, woven branches, or perhaps mud.  A non-Wabi Sabi reason for this is that wood-framed homes like that stand up better to earthquakes which were frequent.  The frame was better able to flex and sway with the quake to minimize the risk of collapse - and if it did collapse was cheaper to rebuild and would do a minimum of damage on the way down.  Stone/brick walls, or even mud ones, can't flex and would crumble in an earthquake.  But all of this is to say that Japanese homes are *already* quite cold in the winter.  Residents would get through this by dressing more warmly, using small coal braziers to warm the room you're in (or kotatsu, which are a table with a small coal brazier underneath and blankets surrounding it that you can lay in and which capture the heat), and just generally accepting being cold (wabi-sabi).  Also keep in mind that Japan is a very large country - southern Japan has a very mild climate compared to the northern regions.  I don't know where in Japan Seven Samurai happened off the top of my head, or if Kurosawa even gave it a ""place"" in the country.  

A few sources for further reading I would recommend if you really want to understand this topic more in-depth:

**Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings** is one of my favorites.  It was written by Ed Morse back in the 1800's when it was very popular for Westerners to travel Japan and write books about it.  His is notable for an *amazing* collection of sketches he did while there documenting everything he could about the houses he stayed in.  He was also one of the last of his type to do that sort of journey before Japan began to feel the heavy cultural impact of Westernization.  The whole thing can be read online [here](http://www.kellscraft.com/JapaneseHomes/JapaneseHomesContentPage.html) but paper copies aren't too expensive either.


**Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers** by Leonard Koren does a great job introducing the concepts of Wabi Sabi for a Western mind.  

**In Praise Of Shadows** by Jun'ichirō Tanizaki was a long essay written by a famous Japanese author around the time Kurosawa was making his films where he praised what he saw as Japanese aeshtetic and lamented the impact the Western world had on Japan.  Particularly he frames his essay around the contrast for the West's love of light and cleanliness with the Wabi Sabi love of shadow.  

**The Lessons of Japanese Architecture** by Jiro Harada is a very approachable breakdown of a lot of traditional Japanese architecutre

**Measure and Construction of the Japanese House** by Heino Engel is a more deep-dive into the practicalities of house design and construction.

As an aside, I love Kurosawa's movies so I was glad to see this question.  One of my favorite things about his work is his dedication to representing the old lifestyle as accurately as possible as a framework for his stories, even going so far as to rent out preserved ""museum towns"" that have been kept unchanged for centuries, and filming his entire movies in them.  It's so cool to see how the old buildings were used as part of a daily lifestyle rather than to just read about it."
"Jousting snails are witty and amusing--I do think the comparison to New York cartoons and drawings is an apt one. I'm not sure I would draw a jocks vs nerds (or rather, ""weird art kids"") link, though. These books were paid for and owned by the nobility, the knightly classes. People in medieval Europe enjoyed poking fun at themselves. (Yes, even clerics.) A knight jousting a snail could be a humorous reminder of the futility of the worldly role in the face of greater spiritual matters."

The editorial at the top of the page mentions ""\[a\] news report""^(1) indicating that King himself ""seemed 'stunned' by the verdict,"" and that ""his parents 'collapsed in tears'.""

This isn't public sentiment, as per your question, but this does provide some context as to King's own expectations of the outcome.

"The central and northern parts of the Iberian Peninsula took the Romans centuries to conquer. Once the entire peninsula had been subdued, however, Lusitania - the province that includes the modern nation of Portugal - was neither notably rebellious nor especially ungovernable. 

I was unable to locate the source of your quote. I saw it attributed to the Republican general Galba (notorious for his [slaughter of unarmed Lusitanians](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/appian-the-spanish-wars/appian-the-spanish-wars-12/#58) in the second century BCE) and to Caesar (notorious for being Caesar). But I never saw a specific source quoted, and failed to find it in what I assumed to be the logical places. According to [this article](https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5905456) (see pp. 391-2), the quote's roots are medieval, not ancient.

Although the phrase seems to be a later invention, it has some historical basis. After taking the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula from the Carthaginians, the Romans worked for nearly two centuries to conquer the rest. Most of the Iberian Peninsula was characterized by networks of small settlements and a basically pastoral economy. The Romans could destroy a Hellenistic kingdom by taking its capital and/or destroying the king's army. But in Iberia, they had fight a seemingly endless series of small actions, and victory meant only the acquisition of a chiefdom. The Romans were also repeatedly distracted from their conquests - above all by wars in the East - and tended to send armies and plan campaigns on a scale calculated to win a triumph for the governor, not permanent annexation. 

The political origins of the modern nation of Portugal are, of course, medieval. The region - and later province - that the Romans called Lusitania was neither culturally unified nor politically distinct. But the Romans did associate Lusitania with [Viriathus](https://www.ancient.eu/Viriathus/), the most formidable Iberian general they ever faced. The region was also closely linked with the rogue general [Sertorius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Quintus-Sertorius). Lusitania, finally, was less thickly settled than regions farther south and east, and may have seemed correspondingly more ""barbaric"" to Roman eyes. 

In the imperial era, as mentioned earlier, the province of Lusitania was not particularly given to rebellion. The rebellious part of Spain in the imperial era was the far north, where the only Spanish legions were stationed. Lusitania was, if anything, quietly prosperous. Though never a notably wealthy province, it was fully integrated into the imperial economy. Emerita Augusta (now Merida, Spain), was an impressive place; the modern city, in fact, still features the [longest extant Roman bridge](https://toldinstone.com/bridge-on-the-river-guadiana/).

As far as I can tell, in short, Portugal's reputation for being ungovernable owes more to modern nationalism than ancient intractability."

According to Paul Kennedy's Engineers of Victory, Japan's plan wasn't to conquer the United States. Japan needed the natural resources of SE Asia, but they were concerned about the possibility of US hindrance. Their intention was to capture and fortify a defensive perimeter of islands. [This map here](https://www.gifex.com/detail-en/2009-09-17-17/Greatest_Extent_of_Japanese_advance_Aug_1942.html) does a good job of showing Japan's expansion. By holding and fortifying these islands and crippling US naval operations at Pearl Harbor, Japan assumed the United States would be unable to mount a strong and timely offensive on the defensive island perimeter. They then planned to catch the United States up in a costly war, with the only US reward being a string of distant islands which would hopefully prove to be insufficient incentive to continue waging a trans-Pacific war. Japan then assumed an armistice could be signed, and they'd be left with SE Asia and most, if not all, of the islands.



So why didn't this work? Before the war, few people realized how vitally important aircraft carriers would be, or just how big their potential was. This is *not* to say that they were generally written off. Japan produced the *Akagi*, *Kaga*, *Soryu*, *Shokaku*, *Zuikaku*, and several others not named in the text, before the war began. The United States had five carriers in the Pacific, the *Lexington*, *Yorktown*, *Saratoga*, *Enterprise*, and *Hornet*. However, it was believed by many that the battleship still ruled the seas. Carriers were useful and Japan utilized them in attacking Pearl Harbor, but Japan still invested most of her naval resources in battleships, assuming that with airbases on fortified islands protected by the battleships, Pearl Harbor out of commission, and US naval bases now 3000 miles away on the West Coast, the United States couldn't mount much of a response.


People make so much of US industrial capacity in WWII that it can become tiresome, but it's for good reason. During the war, the US ordered 31 *Essex*-class aircraft carriers. They completed 24, only because the apparent pending conclusion to the war rendered the remaining 7 unnecessary. Japan produced 1 new carrier. They'd hoped to use their still prodigious fleet to force a war of attrition through the islands that would prompt the US to settle for peace, but their now-outdated fleet had no chance of holding up to the United States' cutting-edge carrier fleet.

"The relevant section from Plutarch's Life of Antony: 

""For her beauty, as we are told, was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her; but converse with her had an irresistible charm, and her presence, combined with the persuasiveness of her discourse and the character which was somehow diffused about her behaviour towards others, had something stimulating about it. There was sweetness also in the tones of her voice; and her tongue, like an instrument of many strings, she could readily turn to whatever language she pleased, so that in her interviews with Barbarians she very seldom had need of an interpreter, but made her replies to most of them herself."""
"I can help you with your corollary question from my own area of study, namely philosophy. An important source for the mid-20th century dystopian fiction, especially Orwellian fiction, is the 18th century concept of the panopticon, what you could call the birth of the concept of a surveillance society as we recognise it today. It was developed by the 18th and 19th century philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham. Bentham is known as one of the first philosophers to fully develop an ethical theory of utilitarianism. Explained in short, classic utilitarianism states that the most ethical choices are those that create the most happiness for the most people.

Now, the idea of the panopticon is to design institutions like prisons (its most famous application, but also schools, hospitals, factories, etc) in such a way that a central point in the building can keep watch over *everything* that goes on in the place. In other words; Big Brother is watching you.

Often, when we look at a prison or other building designed according to panopticon principles we get a feeling of an oppressive, authoritarian, centralised control where privacy is nonexistant. But this wasn't how Bentham viewed it. According to Bentham, this way of building would be better for both the people being watched and the watcher. it would create more goodness for more people than the older methods of incarceration, healthcare and employment, as it would force the public to follow the rules without the guards having to resort to physical violence as was often the norm back then. He saw it as more humane in that regard, as compared to the more brutal approach from the aristocratic regimes at the time, and it fit his utilitarian views.

In the mid-19th century, prisons in the UK actually started being built with panopticon principles in mind, and it became more popular as time went on, and with it surveillance principles became wider known. Writers like George Orwell did not see Bentham's ideas in the same positive light. And that's of little surprise considering the level of surveillance and censorship he was put under by the British government due to his leftist politics. So he took those ideas of a surveillance society and set them in the negative light many people often refer to today.

So in short, the idea of the 'Thought Police' and Big Brother is definitely older than Orwell and his contemporaries. But back when it was first developed in a way that is recognizable to us it was seen as almost utopian. Orwell however, as someone who was intensely surveilled, thought different and gave us the dystopian interpretation of those principles that we usually use today."

Hi there -- this seems to get at the meat of the matter. What sources in particular did you draw on for this answer? 
"Before I begin, full disclosure: I’m not a historian. Rather, I’m a political scientist who studies representation, including gender representation, albeit mostly in advanced democracies.  As such I’m able to speak to broad trends of the history of women’s representation, but I may miss some finer points about specific cases, and will am basing my answer off of political science rather than historical research. 


To begin, it’s important to make a distinction between the representation of women overall, and women as head of government/head of state. While the United States has never had a woman as president, unlike the examples you mention, it actually performs better in terms of the percentage of women in its federal legislature (although it is still very far from parity).  The factors that determine these two things are also fairly different, as women’s legislative representation his heavily influenced by factors such as the presence of quotas (which Pakistan and Bangladesh both have in the form of reserved seats)(Hughes 2011), levels of corruption (corruption generally inhibits women’s representation (Stockemer 2011; Swamy et al. 2001)), and parties’ political recruitment practices(Bjarnegård 2013; Norris and Lovenduski 1995). 

It’s also important to note that, contrary to popular belief, discrimination by voters is actually not well-established as a major barrier to women’s representation, at least in advanced western democracies (Sevi, Arel-Bundock, and Blais 2019; Darcy and Schramm 1977). By and large, women receive more-or-less the same number of votes as their male counterparts, although there is some debate as to if women need to be more qualified in order to get the chance to run (Fulton 2012; Black and Erickson 2003). As such, even accepting that the US is more gender egalitarian, this doesn’t necessarily address all of women’s barriers to entry in politics. 

All this said though, you are indeed hitting on a real phenomenon. “In the post World War II period only fifty women have been elected heads of state of their respective countries. Of these fifty women, eleven have come from South and Southeast Asia”(Wijekoon 2000). The reasons for this, unfortunately, are a bit murky, but there’s a few factors we can point to. First, it’s worth noting the role of family dynasty in all of this. For example, India’s Indira Gandhi and Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto both are the daughters of prime ministers. Wijekoon’s article places a fair deal of emphasis on this factor, arguing that the political culture of South/South-East Asia is very amenable to political dynasties.

Beyond this, the parliamentary systems used in these countries have been pointed to by many scholars as more favourable to electing female leaders, for a number of reasons (Jalalzai 2018). Among these are greater hesitancy women may have to enter a primary race in a presidential system (such as the US), and way that political parties can better mitigate gender discrimination in a parliamentary system. 

A final factor pointed to in the literature to explain women’s rise to power in South/South-East Asian countries, and indeed around the world, has been response to political crises. Many female leaders have come to power in the wake of an assassination, corruption scandal, or other political event that calls for dramatic and visible change. In these situations, female politicians can capitalise on many gender stereotypes (women as nurturing, as virtuous, as mothering, etc) and political parties can use a female leader to demonstrate their commitment to real change. This goes hand-in-hand with parliamentary systems, as it is much easier to replace a prime minister than it is to replace a US president, due to the latter’s very fixed election cycle. 

In conclusion, I hope this answer isn’t too dissatisfying. Explaining women’s representation is a very complex topic, particularly in attempting to explain why something *didn’t* happen (in the US case). Hopefully an actual historian will be able to come along and provide more detail on the particular female leaders of the countries you mention in your question.

"> Although Melcher admits that the state leaned decidedly Republican, it still featured more ""partisan competitiveness"" than most others during the era.

One thing that I think is worth noting here is that, because Republicans won 14 of the 18 presidential elections held between 1860 and 1928, Democrats were naturally quite concerned with picking off a state that usually voted Republican. As Shelley and Archer discuss, Democrats could win presidential elections during this period only by sweeping the (strongly Democratic) Solid South and expanding into the Republican-leaning states of the Midwest and/or the Northeast. By the same token, Republicans were naturally quite concerned with defending these states."

"In a paper presented to the American Philosophical Society, Henry Phillips noted that Webster's choice of Zee in his dictionaries was ""perhaps... some petty local peculiarity in the small country towns of New England (which) led him to believe that no other pronunciation could be a correct one.""  He also quoted another author, ""This in New England is always zee; in the South, it is zed, while Pennsylvania seems to halt between the two opinions.""  In a survey of dictionaries, he notes several published in the U.S. which used *zed*.  So, thinking of *zee* as American and *zed* as British creates confusion.  The answer to your question seems to involve answering: Why did *zee* come to replace *zed* in the U.S.?  Why was *zee* common in New England as opposed to *zed*, *izzard*, *zod*, etc.?

Phillips suggests why there might be a preference for *zee* over  *zed*, *izzard*, *zod*, etc.  He notes ""zee is clearly a schoolmaster's desire to get rid of the strange sounding zed, and to make z follow the analogy of (some) other letter.""  Analogical change is very common in languages.  So, given that we say *bee*, *cee*, and *dee*, *zee* could have been an error, a preference, or a preferred error because it sounds like what you call a letter.  That's a good enough theory.

"Late, but it should be noted the Allies knew about the Holocaust well before they found the camps. They perhaps didn't know about the utter extent of it all, but it was hardly a well kept secret--especially with the massive numbers of refugees that had escaped Germany and other elements like the Polish resistance having been *very* knowledgeable of what was happening and having been in contact with the Allies through the duration of the war.

"The Japanese conception of victory was closely modeled on the the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905 and the defeat of the Russians by the Japanese. 

The Japanese wanted a decisive battle with the that would result in the United States suing for peace. The name for this is 艦隊決戦  - Kantai Kessen or Decisive War Doctrine. Like much of the strategic naval thinking of the time this strategy was inspired by Alfred Thayer Mahan's Influence of Sea Power upon History.

The idea was the Japanese would draw the American fleet from it's bases in California and Hawaii to the east. Taking advantage of the extraordinary long supply lines and distance traveled, the Japanese would use their long range fleet submarines to pick off support vehicles. Finally, the Japanese would surprise the American fleet with a night battleship and torpedo attack, destroying the American fleet, and forcing the United States to sue for peace. You can see this plan most clearly in the Japanese plans for Midway. 

There was never any serious plan to invade the USA mainland - and the only considered plan to invade a non-peripheral USA territory was Hawaii - and it was only after Pearl Harbor when the Japanese began to realize exactly how big of a strategic mistake leaving Pearl Harbor in place was there any planning (and the plans were never realistic). 

None of these plans depended on Germany defeating the USA. The Army had vague plans of maybe eventually splitting India between Japan and Germany - the army had always been more closely associated with Germany - but the Navy never considered German actions in their plans. 

I've reviewed almost all of the broken Diplomatic messages that had anything to do with Germany and Japanese relations either before the war or after.  It's remarkable how little the Japanese and the Germany had any common strategic discussions or idea what to do with the USA. This had catastrophic implications for both the Germans and Japanese. It was the USSR discovering that the Japanese had no plans to actively invade Russia in 1941 that led to the Siberian forces being freed up to save Moscow in 1941.

"> It is new Rome in its courtly manners and shapely figure .... 

>Then Mexico is the heaven of this world, 

> For here grows the greatest beauty that the world has seen.

> -- Bernardo de Balbuena, Grandeza Mexicana (1604)

Thus compared the Mexican criollo his hometown Mexico with ancient Rome, showing off the city's riches and importance. But how different were both?

Well for starters both conquest campaigns took place on two different continents and over 1000 years apart. You're basically asking two questions here, on Rome comparisons and on Tenochtitlan. So I'll first talk a bit about why I think making this comparison is difficult if not impossible, then turn to the siege of Tenochtitlan and to the continuities with the pre-colonial city and culture - which did and do exist. 

There were many parallels between Spanish and Aztec societies, which were already noticed at that time: hierarchical society with rulers, noblemen and commoners, central position of an organized faith, etc. But if one looks more closely, there are also massive differences. This was also the case with the siege of Tenochtitlan - first of all the very different forms of warfare. And then especially the organization of the Nahua (Aztecs) in city-states or altepetl. The groups were loyal to their state, and less so to a larger ""empire"" of the Mexica. This is one reason why different groups and subgroups joined the Spanish; which was certainly the central reason for the fall of Mexica. 

There was the massive demographic catastrophe, killing in some regions up to 90% of the population through a combination of new diseases, war, forced labor and resettlements. There was, in short, modern European colonialisation at play, with ruler built partly on law and on violence. And important adaptation and resistance to it, too.

I am researching colonial Mexico and not ancient Rome - but even in this very brief overview, numerous differences from the fall of Rome are apparent. Above all, however, I would like to emphasize the ultimately very different society with which the Spaniards came into contact, with its own distinct cosmology and way of life. For this reason alone it seems difficult to compare the two examples directly without falling into generalisations or Eurocentrism (sorry Balbuena!).

I think that comparisons can be helpful in history, but especially when the objects are comparable. This comparison seems problematic here. What I can do is to address the second part of the question, which hopefully will allow everyone to make their own comparisons.

(Adapted from an earlier answer)


So we can note at least two reasons for Cortés' comparatively harsh actions against Tenochtitlan (and the Mexica): military and religious reasons. His native allies also used the fall of the Mexica as an opportunity for revenge. Lastly, not all of pre-Hispanic Tenochtitlan was destroyed with the Spanish victory, as its indigenous population rebuilt large parts of the city afterwards.

## Military reasons

The Spanish were at first very impressed with the huge city they found built on Lake Tezcoco (estimates are of roughly 250.000 inhabitants), with its large markets and canal system. This changed with the Noche Triste, when after a massacre carried out by one of Cortés' generals the Spanish were chased from the city in 1520. Barbara Mundy notes (in “Death of Aztec Tenochtitlan, the Life of Mexico City“)

> While Cortés initially wrote admiringly of the city in his letters to Charles V, his attitude and those of his fellow conquistadores would change dramatically when they attempted to capture the watery city. The surrounding lake functioned like a great moat protecting the island city, and the bridges spanning the breaks in the causeways, which allowed the flow of water from one part of the system to another, could be removed to further isolate the island capital. 

> [During the Noche Triste, the Spaniards] found that their enemies used the urband canals as transport routes for canoes filled with as many as 60 armed warriors each. Slogging around the canals slowed the conquistadores in their retreat, and when, exhausted, they fled on foot along the causeways, those raised roads served to organize them into a neat firing line for the Mexica sharpshooting archers gathered alongside in the lake in their canoes. Small wonder that they emerged from the war with little appreciation of the role that these causeways and dikes played in protecting the city from the scourges of floods. (p. 76)

This knowledge of the canals and dikes was then used by the Spaniards in their siege of the city about a year later. They methodically destroyed these structures that had helped the Mexica, used them to their advantage, and even cut the city fresh water supply. These were methods of warfare only bent on conquering the city that Cortés and his men had lost once before, without much thought about the long-term effects. These effects were harsh: For centuries after conquest, the city then known as Mexico City would be plagued by heavy floodings, lacking the protection of the dike system, the knowledge of which was lost by then. This led to many projects of draining lake Tezcoco, finished centuries later, which has led to massive other problems for the city. 

Here's [the earliest European map of Tenochtitlan](https://www.historytoday.com/sites/default/files/tenoch.jpg), sent with one of Cortés letters in 1524 so 3 years after the siege. It's probably based on native maps and gives a good idea of the bridges and moats I find.

But getting back to general military reasons: For Cortés at this point it was imperative to conquer Tenochtitlan, since his whole plan was built on overthrowing the Mexica, leaders of the Aztec Triple Alliance. The year between the Noche Triste and the siege of Tenochtitlan he had spent preparing by planning attack plans with canoes, and bringing together more native allies – including from Tlaxcala, Tezcoco and ~~Huejotrinco~~Huejotzinco. His strong reaction against Tenochtitlan was partly typical European siege warfare; and party due to the city's special position lying on a lake, and to his necessity of conquering it. They also fits in a pattern of Cortés using sometimes extreme violence as examplary punishment, so that other native groups would not oppose him (also evident in his later hanging of the last Mexica ruler Cuauhtemoc). Overall the success of his whole military campaign 1519-21 hinged the conquest of the capital.

And his native allies were not passive either after the city's fall. This important since there wre around 1.000 with estimated 200.000 native allies without whom the Psanish siege woould've been impossible.
One native chronicler, Fernando de Alva Ixtlixlochitl, describes that the Tlaxcalans actually were more brutal against the Mexica who remained in the city, who had been their traditional enemies. While  Alva Ixtlixlochitl had an anti-Tlaxcala bias, we can deduce that overall it was in many native allies interest to avenge themselves of their former overlords the Mexica – in part by looting their former capital.


## Religious reasons

After the city had fallen into Spanish hands, major buildings like the palace and the temple were destroyed. However, their fundaments remain intact until today (the temple can be visited), with e.g. the palace building the base of the later colonial palace. In the descriptions of conquistadors like Cortés and Díaz de Castillo they already note their disdain of the temple during their first visit – in contrast to their suprise and admiration of the canal system, and the large markets that were according to them bigger than any in Spain. 

Of course, the conversion of the native population to Christianity was officially the main reason for Spanish colonial expansion. So the destruction of temples fits with a larger pattern of destroying any important symbols of native beliefs: especially statues, art, manuscripts, and of course the large temples. This has to do also with the influence of religious orders in early colonial Mexico. Especially the Franciscans were called by Cortés there shortly after conquest, and showed fervour for destroying signs of native faith; but also of learning about it in order to replace it more effectively. 

Stepping back from Tenochtitlan, I'll add that the destruction of temples happened in many other cities in central Mexico after they fell under Spanish jurisdiction or were conquered. Even though many were not destroyed as systematically as Tenochtitlan was (in part due to its special position). What is more, destroying temple of other religions and building Christian cathedrals has a long tradition in Iberia. This is what happened during the “reconquista” in medieval Iberia, with the major cathedrals e.g. in Sevilla and Cordoba built over the remains (or partly inside) the former mosques. So that the Mexican conquistadors also built on medieval Iberian patterns here, as in many other areas. We have then in Tenochtitlan also a symbolic replacement of native buildings representing state power (palace) and religion (temple) with their Spanish equivalents."
Follow-up question: were there even barges in 16th century France?
"> I do not know much about the growth of the Illuminati conspiracy theories through the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century, but Eighteenth-Century British propaganda was extremely effective and lasted in our collective cultural memory.

I can expand on that a little. 

So, going in to the 19th century there was already a tradition of conspiratorial secret group literature and line of thought. This had roughly three major expressions:

* Anti-Masonry - Conspiracy theories about masonic groups or cabals, sometimes descended from or controlled by the Illuminati, were rife in anti-masonic political rhetoric and literature throughout the 19th century in the United States (and in other countries at other times, according to the political climate). This especially found expression in incidents like the Taxil Hoax in the 1890s.

* Usage of the Illuminati name and image by groups, both public and private - This was especially the case for certain occult groups descended or influenced by freemasonry. The Ordo Templi Orientis, for example, names the VIII° ""Perfect Pontiff of the Illuminati""; the Theosophical Society used the term ""Illuminati"" not in the strict sense of referring to the Bavarian lodge, but as an adept or one who had been enlightened, etc. These groups were borrowing on the reputation of the Bavarian Illuminati, the same connections the Anti-Masons would cry against them for.

* Fiction! - All of this conspiracy theory stuff made for great drama. This started out as an outgrowth of the Rosicrucian-type literature of the late 18th century into the field of the Gothic novel, starting with *The Horrid Mysteries; A Story from the German of the Marquis of Grosse* (1796), and was pastiched in *Nightmare Abbey* (1818):

>  He built many castles in the air, and peopled them with secret tribunals, and bands of illuminati, who were always the imaginary instruments of his projected regeneration of the human species. As he intended to institute a perfect republic, he invested himself with absolute sovereignty over these mystical dispensers of liberty. He slept with Horrid Mysteries under his pillow, and dreamed of venerable eleutherarchs and ghastly confederates holding midnight conventions in subterranean caves. He passed whole mornings in his study, immersed in gloomy reverie, stalking about the room in his nightcap, which he pulled over his eyes like a cowl, and folding his striped calico dressing-gown about him like the mantle of a conspirator.

None of these three influences entirely fell away, although they changed shape a couple of times. The general *idea* of the Illuminati and being ""illuminated"" or ""Enlightened"" entered the general parlance of both occult thought and conspiracy theory circles, and both of these ideas continued to influence popular fiction - which continued to influence occult thought and conspiracy theory circles in a vicious feedback loop! 

Mostly these were ideas and concepts more than specific references to the Bavarian Illuminati, which had become something of a footnote in the not-so-secret histories claimed and published by occult groups and conspiracy theorists. The most popular image of the Illuminati as the all-controlling head of a group of secret organizations that control the world is Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea's classic *The Illuminatus! Trilogy* (1975), which inspired a comic book adaptation, various games, and roleplaying game products like *GURPS Illuminati* (1992); and Umberto Eco's novel *Foucault's Pendulum* (1988).

It's important to realize that both Shea/Wilson and Eco's novels are not strictly based on the historical Illuminati in any sense; the *Illuminatus!* trilogy a riotous romp through various occult, conspiracy, fringe science, drug, and 60s pop culture riffs, while Eco is specifically making a point about the nature of conspiracy theories and how individuals and groups can start believing in their own rhetoric and extraordinary claims. Later books like Dan Brown's *Angels & Demons* (2000) tend to play it more straight, but even in that book the Illuminati turns out to be a hoax.

The importance of these books is on their introduction and popularization of what would normally be very fringe conspiracy theory/occult theory/historical footnote stuff to a more mainstream audience - and at that they succeed brilliantly, all the more so as popular culture started to cohere and make it ever easier to share weird ideas and information. In the 1930s, self-proclaimed Rosicrucians advertized in the pages of *Weird Tales*, in the 1990s you get the *X-Files* and ""black helicopter"" myths.

But there's a darker side to it. Actual conspiracy theorists who seriously believe - or at least seriously push - the idea that there's a quasi-Masonic group that either controls the government or is trying to have been part of the conversation since the Anti-Masonic parties in the 19th century. Folks like John Todd were making bizarre claims about the nefarious Illuminati in the US in the 1960s and 70s, and it received much more widespread broadcasting when cartoonist Jack Chick created the comic book *The Broken Cross* to push Todd's message, and some of his claims still make it into books. Anti-Illuminati propaganda often crosses over with anti-Semitism, ultra-nationalism, anti-Catholicism, and more bizarre fringe movements and groups."
"Their cities were; Antioch and Alexandria, in fact, were the two largest Greek-speaking cities anywhere (with the possible exception of Seleucia in the Parthian Empire). But at the time of the Arab Conquests, despite a millennium of Hellenization, both the Syrian and the Egyptian countryside remained largely non-Greek speaking. Although Christianization seems to have helped to bring about the extinction of many non-Greek languages in rural Anatolia, it actually strengthened Syriac and Coptic, which became important vehicles for Christian literature. Arabic replaced the Greek of the cities fairly quickly, but Syriac and Coptic survived as living languages much longer."
"This was in the context of World War I - firearm technology had largely supplanted the sword and personal body armor in previous conflicts, but this was essentially one of the last gasps of the hallmark arms & armor of the medieval era, and if you look at the propaganda material generated (like Machen's ""The Bowmen"") there is a largely romantic callback to the image of the medieval knight as an icon of martial spirit and nobility - contrasted with the bloodiness and impersonal nature of modern warfare, with its deaths at increasingly long ranges by foes that could hardly see each other, and against which there was little to no practical defense; warfare that included not just bombs, but poison gas, and eventually flamethrowers and tanks. World War I was, in a lot of ways, the death of any pretense to chivalry - the U.S. Civil War could still see allusions to Arthurian myth and legend - Robert E. Lee was famously called [""the realized King Arthur""](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/People/Robert_E_Lee/FREREL/4/18*.html), but there was little romanticism in the Great War - which in part led, during the 1920s and 30s, to the desire to cast back to a (romantically) morally simpler period with more direct conflicts. 

One of the ways these different conceptions of medievalism - the romanticization and the un-romanticization - came together was in the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) founded in 1966; this was a group that was largely inspired by the quasi-medieval aesthetic of fantasy authors like J. R. R. Tolkien and T. H. White, but wanted to actually experience something of it, which involved greater research and investment in practical skills and medieval history. You can read about more of the history of the SCA [here](http://www.sca.org/officers/chatelain/sca-intro.html), but their focus on the Middle Ages ""as they ought to have been"" shows how deeply the romanticized medieval aesthetic has penetrated in popular culture.

While fantasy never ""went away,"" with many notable works in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, it was the paperback publication of *The Lord of the Rings* in 1965, the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, and the paperback publication of Robert E. Howard in the late 60s which all contributed to a ""boom"" in fantasy novels and stories, as well as the creation of *Dungeons & Dragons* in 1974, that cemented the ""medieval"" aesthetic in contemporary fantasy - but this was not the Middle Ages as we know them from history, this was a fantasy medieval which often glossed over many of the realities of the period in favor of certain popular stereotypes, particularly with regards to film and television - you can see the influence of costumes and setting from Errol Flynn's *Robin Hood* (1938) on Disney's animated *Robin Hood* (1973), for example.

I want to add that while we still have a lot of quasi-medievalism from Tolkien, *Dungeons & Dragons*, and the many other fantasy works that sometimes get overlooked like Poul Anderson's *The Broken Sword* (1955) and Katherine Kurtz's Deryni novels (starting in 1970), there has also been a corresponding trend since the 1930s into much grittier - although not always more realistic - quasi-medieval fantasy. You can arguably see this start in the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard, but it is very evident in the Kane novels of Karl Edward Wagner, the Warhammer setting of Games Workshop (which quite literally gave us the phrase ""grimdark""), and the Game of Thrones setting of George R. R. Martin."

"Speaking to the railway aspect of your question, there were other transcontinental railroads competing with the one that went through Montana (the Northern Pacific). The Central Pacific / Union Pacific in particular was the first, and probably the most significant in terms of volume and value of freight, U.S. transcontinental railroad network. These lines passed south of Montana, through Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho.

Conversely, all of the major Canadian routes passed through Alberta, either through Edmonton or Calgary.

"It was very effective. There are several examples of its effectiveness, particularly in the many battles where European forces expanded or consolidated their empires.

In the 1870s and 1880s the British used the gatling gun against African tribes armed primarily with spears in the Anglo-Zulu and Anglo-Ashanti wars (specifically the 3rd Anglo-Ashanti war in this case) and against forces with firearms and canons in the Anglo-Egyptian war (1882). In the battle of Tel-el-kabir (Anglo-Egyptian war) for example, the British managed a 50:1 ratio in Egyptian dead vs. their dead (2000 to 39), partially due to the use of gatling guns. In the Battle of Ulundi (Anglo-Zulu war, 1879) the British were outnumbered nearly 3:1 but through the use of two gatling guns and canons firing cannister shot were able to win the battle with a huge mismatch in fatalities (fewer than 20 killed on the British side, nearly 500 dead on the Zulu side).

In a particularly noteworthy example there is the Battle of San Juan Hill during the Spanish-American War (1898). While assaulting Kettle Hill 3 gatling guns were employed to provide continuous suppressive fire against the Spanish, allowing American forces to advance up the hill in what would have otherwise been suicidal conditions. In a period of about 8 and a half minutes three guns expended about 18,000 rounds, indicating the gatlings were in near continuous use during that period of time. After the Americans had taken the hill and while the gatling guns were being repositioned to the top of San Juan ridge a hasty counter-attack by about 600 Spanish soldiers was cut down with fire from just a single gatling, killing nearly the entirety of the force in a matter of minutes.

There are many other contemporary examples. Suffice it to say that the gatling gun was quite effective under the right conditions and effectively destroyed the potential for massed frontal assaults (even with favorable numbers of soldiers). That doesn't mean it was an unstoppable devastating force in all cases, it had its limitations just as any weapon does, but it was quite devastating in the few specific cases where it could shine (open ground, large numbers of close packed enemy troops).

The impact it had on warfare was to make frontal charges much less effective. It and its successors (the Maxim gun and other fully automatic machine guns) drove warfare increasingly toward the WWI model: trenches and fortifications across a front-line that was in most cases suicide to attempt to cross, even en masse. And that eventually led to modern combined arms tactics, the employment of artillery, small arms, light machine guns, grenades, mortars, mobile armor (tanks, APCs, AFVs, etc.), and even aircraft in a carefully coordinated assault. And, incidentally, the demise of cavalry (though artillery is also a significant contributing factor there)."
"H.G. Wells and Jules Verne came about right at the time in which science was working miracles of technology and the future seemed boundless. They also both channeled those impulses into social speculation as well, moving beyond simply trying to guess future technologies. They had a disproportionate impact on the thinking of many educated and often well-placed peoples who were similarly impressed by the new technological modernity, who in turn influenced the development of technology."

I'm a home cook and contribute more frequently to /r/askculinary, but I can mention that having read Bill Buford's *Heat*, in which he spends a sizable portion of the book discussing the history of recipe publication in Italy dating back to the 15th and 16th Century (the period when the spice trade was emerging between Italy and the Far East), the most sought after spices in Europe were nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. The plant from which clove is derived is native only to a single island in Indonesia, so clove was extremely rare and sought after for many hundreds of years. If you managed to eat some, you were probably wealthy and educated, and therefore you might have written about it, which is how we know about the societal impact of these spices today. The addition of clove and nutmeg to semolina pasta (essentially ground wheat, egg, salt, and water), ricotta cheese, and butter (essentially cow's milk) is what gives us ravioli: one of the earliest recorded ""recipe-worthy"" Italian dishes.

I suspect, though, based on your question, that you're asking about the history of ""spicy"" foods, not ""spiced"" foods-- that is-- capsaicin-inflected foods with flavors derived from chiles and peppers. Here I can only point you towards the Columbian exchange, which is occurring roughly concurrently, but from the opposite end of the world. Spanish and Portuguese explorers are returning from expeditions to the Americas and bringing crops back to Europe, including potatoes, tomatoes, maize, peppers, and squash. These too would have a sizable impact on cuisine in Southern Europe, especially in Italy and Spain. Maize gives us polenta, for instance, which emerges as a rival grain staple to semolina wheat in certain parts of Italy.

As for how crops from the Americas (including peppers and chiles) made their way to Asia, the answer is almost certainly via European spice traders in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, some originating from Venice or other parts of what is now Northern Italy, others from Portuguese expeditions to China, others from Dutch expeditions to Indonesia. But there are also many plants native to Asia that produced such remarkably aromatic and exotic flavors (to European palates) that ""spices"" sealed their reputation as exotic luxury goods brought in from far corners of the non-European world, which at that time included both Asia *and* the Americas.

If I'm interpreting your question right, you also want to know a timeframe on how those crops-- brought from the Americas to Asia-- found their way into Asian preparations. For that I can say that many plants that provided flavors exotic to European palates in the 16th century (in addition to cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove these might also include ginger, coriander, and certain varieties of citrus) were already there. However, the history of capsaicin heat in those cuisines *specifically* is not something I'm prepared to comment on.

The last bit worth addressing, and maybe this isn't so much historical as it is sociological, is that current preparations of ""Thai""/""Indian""/""Chinese"" cuisines-- especially in present-day Europe and the Americas-- are not authentic dishes prepared as they were in the pre-colonial era, but are products of local tastes, food preferences, and ingredient availability. General Tso's chicken is a perfect example of such a dish: it uses sugar (not Chinese), chile  powder (either chile arbol or cayenne pepper, neither Chinese), and deep-fried chicken leg meat (not a Chinese cooking method) to create a dish that was massively popular when and where it was invented: in a Chinese-owned restaurant in New York City in the late 1970s. The only thing those ingredients have in common is that they're cheap to buy in bulk. "

"Yes, I will admit here that I simplified for the narrative's sake, and that the dichotomy was more of a spectrum, but I feel I needed to frame it that way to properly answer the question. "
"It should be mentioned that Jonathan Israel does not consider Robespierre and the Jacobins to be members of the Radical Enlightenment (in his book *Revolutionary Ideas*) but rather reactionary populists inspired by Rousseau (who isn't considered a Radical Enlightenment adherent either), who managed to coup the revolution and eliminate most of the Radical Enlightenment leadership (commonly known as the Brissotins or Girondists).

Of course your summary was about how these terms were viewed in counter enlightenment literature at the time, and it is very true that Robespierre and the Jacobins were mixed up with the Radical Enlightenment for propaganda purposes, just as the Illuminati was deliberately mixed up with the French Revolution by people such as Barruel and Robison."
"More can always be said, but [this older answer which focuses on 1876 election](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7flfd4/the_us_presidential_election_of_1876_had_the/dqcyh7h/) may be of interest, which I'll repost here with some slight updates. It doesn't look at 1896 specifically, but is contrasting the late 1800s with the early 1900s, and the impact of Jim Crow and other voter suppression, so is quite relevant.

-------

To start things off, it is important to keep in mind that turnout was consistently high in the late 1800s. If you look at [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/rjFrb) you can see that while 1876 was the highpoint, it wasn't exactly an anomaly, and voter turnout was consistently high in the elections preceding it. It sticks out because, although the drop wasn't *immediately* afterwards, it certainly preceded the continuing decline in voter turnout that would begin precipitously around 1900.

So why did voting decline in that period? Well, one of the most simple reasons (but not only, of course) to look at is Jim Crow. While under Reconstruction, black men (women being generally deprived of the vote) could, for the most part, go to the polls and exercise their right to vote, this began to change after Reconstruction was ended (not to say it didn't happen before, just not as effectively), and the Redeemer governments worked through various means to disenfranchise vast swathes of voters in the American South. The effect of this can't be underrated. While in the 1876 election the South saw turnout roughly comparable to the rest of the country, at 75 percent, vote suppression methods such as literacy tests not to mention outright fraud, saw the turnout decline to 46 percent at the turn of the century. By the 1924 election, *19 percent* of those theoretically eligible to vote were actually showing up at the polls. And to be sure, while the primary target was black voters, many poorer, illiterate whites were disenfranchised too, despite ""loopholes"" to grandfather many of them in. In Louisiana, for instance, while 90 percent of black voters were barred from the polls, 60 percent of whites were as well. While Jim Crow should absolutely be understood as primarily a racial regime, it was quite oligarchical as well, with power being concentrated in the hands mostly of upper-class whites, who wanted to share it with no one.

This allows us to circle back somewhat though to look at 1876, and why it would be slightly above the average of the time though. During the Reconstruction era there were *real efforts* to mobilize poor voters of both races by the Radical Republicans. The example I'm most familiar with was that led by Mahone in Virginia whose Readjuster movement controlled the state for a brief time in the late 1870s-early '80s, propelled by populist support from a coalition of black voters and poor whites. I won't spend to much time on him as I've written about him before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6fent8/did_longstreet_and_other_confederates_really_seek/dihn6ym/?context=3) but the short of it is that in the post-war era, but before Jim Crow laws took hold, we can see a lot of political agitation that struck at the white Democratic establishment in the South that was attempting to reclaim power, and that *for a time* they enjoyed some successes. The 1876 election in particular we can look at as a watershed, with both sides of the argument over Reconstruction seeing heavy stakes. And of course Tilden won the popular vote, but lost anyways, as part of a deal that did end Reconstruction anyways. That cessation meant the evaporation of the Federal protections that allowed those insurgent political movements to compete on a roughly level playing field. Changes weren't immediate, and varied state by state - in Virginia for instance the Readjusters remained in power until 1883, when race riots days before the election were used by the Democrats to stoke voter fears - but it nevertheless meant that the suppression of the black vote and the poor white vote was able to start, a process which wasn't immediate, and took time to take full effect.

So having looked a little at the election of 1876, and how it is a little higher than normal, but not too out of line for the period, this leads to another question... Why was 1872 a *very* noticeable anomaly at 71.3%, bounded in 1868 by a turnout of 78.1%, and of course 1876 at 81.8%?

Let's start in 1868. That year, Grant ran against Horatio Seymour, a northern Democrat from New York, and won with a fairly respectable vote lead. He was especially buoyed by a strong performance in the South, winning many of the former Confederate states. How though? Well, an astute observer might notice that despite a much higher turnout *percentage*, the actual numbers of voters was lower, which would be somewhat counter-intuitive. But, while I have been unable to find any sources which explain *specifically* how that number is calculated, if it is counting eligible voters against turnout, it seems likely that it is accepting the disenfranchisement of many *white* former rebels in the Southern states as legal and proper, and not counting them in the rolls of eligible voters. Certainly, it was the lack of their votes which, unable to balance out the newly enfranchised black vote in the South, helped to support his campaign down there. 

This stands in comparison to the 1872 election, where those former rebels had since been reenfranchised, and thus counted in the rolls of eligible voters. But many voters nevertheless chose to stay home, why? Well, check out who was running! Grant was seeking reelection, but his opponent was Horace Greeley - a Republican, not a Democrat! He was riding the Liberal Republican ticket, a splinter party from the Republicans, dissatisfied with Grant and much of what he had done in his first term. They lacked an entirely cohesive platform but generally stood, at the least, for playing nice with the South, and ending or softening the various Federal policies directed there. Greeley had been one of the most forceful voices in the Republican party for sectional reconciliation, and would win its nomination, but it wasn't straight forward, and caused a good deal of acrimony. At the Party Convention which nominated him, he had gone into is not as the favorite, beating out Charles Francis Adams after six ballots. There was enough bitter disagreements after his victory speech and declaration of platform that Adams supporters mostly just went back to the Grant camp, even if begrudgingly, unwilling to support the ""turncoat and traitor"", representative of the lack of cohesion in the movement from the start.

As for the Democrats... they simply didn't run a candidate. As newspaper editor Theodore Tilton wrote in aptly summing up the sentiment followed:

>Since the Democratic party pledges itself to abide by the constitutional amendments [...] and since it wants universal amnesty [...] why not therefore let the better class of Democrats unite with the anti-Grant Republicans?

But the party was dominated by the Northern Democrats, and perhaps the platform was one they could support, but not necessarily one that made voters in the deep south happy, or at least enough so to nominally vote for a non-Democrat. In the end, it was a fairly tepid election, between two candidates who didn't quite endear themselves well. Grant waltzed to reelection with a 11.80 percent margin on the back of an electorate that perhaps wasn't all in for him, but couldn't get behind Greeley's ""motley"" mix of appeals. What it did represent though was the growing dissatisfaction within *some* parts of the Republican party, who tired of Reconstruction which they were becoming convinced was a failure. It was, of course, a conflict that would underpin the next election, as already noted, but with an actual context between Republicans and Democrats, rather than divisions within the Republican Party alone.

"Thanks for bringing this up. It's actually quite relevant as his work on Jan Hus seems to have been one of Mussolini's most earnest attempts at a serious scholarly work, albeit still in the context of a vulgarization partly motivated by contemporary polemics. It also enjoyed a relative popularity and was somewhat positively regarded.

I actually stumbled a couple of weeks ago on a piece published in Mussolini's *Popolo d'Italia* in late July 1919 which looks like a repurposed outline for a public speech (Mussolini was supposed to hold a series of lectures in the recently ""redeemed lands"" of Venezia Giulia during July 1919 but had to drop out and was replaced by, I think, Longoni). And, there you have it, an interpolation on how the ""Bohemians"" had even managed to create a religion of their own, in comparison to those ""nationally amorphous"" Yugoslavs. The idea that religion represented an important moment in the formation of a national identity seems to have been a quite consistent view in Mussolini's mind. 

As to the ties between nationalism and religious autonomy, one should keep in mind that this was regarded as one of Mussolini's professional strong suits at the time. During his early months as polemist in Geneva, he had crossed words in public debates with a moderatly famous religious speaker, earning a reputation (in the context of local public debates) as both an effective anti-clerical speaker (which is the origin of his reputation as a ""priest eater"", which is a common moniker for a vocal anti-clerical) and as an ""expert"" on religious matters. Something which may have played a role in his designation, a few years later, for a redactionist and then chief editor and section leader in Trent, where anti-clericalism, irredentism and socialism were deeply entangled matters due to the traditional perception of clergy being aligned with the interests of the Austro-Hungarian elites. 

There he appears to have met very little success in improving the state of the Socialist section, but he recorded the peak of his literary fortunes with the publication of his historical novel - a veritable *feulleiton* to be fair - of obvious anti-clerical imprint, *L'Amante del Cardinale* (""The Cardinal's Lover"").


I also have a question, since you have been so kind to offer. Would you say that the ""nationalist"" interpretation of Hus was commonplace enough to be picked up by someone moderately invested in the contemporary matters of Yugoslav-Czech relations already during 1918-19? There was a certain interest in Italy and a certain degree of sympathy for Czechoslovakia during the late stages of the war, also due to the active presence of a Czech legion which had been sponsored by important figures of the interventionist front, for instance the (unrelated) Arnaldo Agnelli."
"Well the early Islamic period was characterised by a small Muslim, Arab population from Hejaz in Western Arabia, governing over a sprawling territory of non Muslim, non Arab 'subjects'. Arab tribes were settled throughout the Caliphate but it was usually pretty small scale and usually occurred in new population centers built specifically for Arab settlers, so it wasn't a particularly disruptive process, with some exceptions in Khorasan. At first, Islam was considered a religion specifically given to Arabs and, while it was not prohibited to non-Arabs, prospective converts had to be sponsored by a specific tribe and even take their surname - even after this you were still basically a second class citizen, known as a *mawali*. The vast jizya tax the state collected from non Muslims often made rulers reluctant to press for the expansion of Islam to foreigners, which kept the empire very cosmopolitan in character.

Arabisation was a very complex phenomenon that we still don't really fully understand, but essentially at some point that huge, diverse mass of non-Muslim, non-Arab people who had inhabited the lands of the fertile crescent and North Africa started to become what we would now call Arabs. It went at a very different pace in different places and its hard to generalise, but it isn't until the post golden age era, after the 10th century, that we start to see the process really pick up. There are several pretty big migrations of Arabs from Arabia into places like the Maghreb which were generally considered to be very disruptive in the traditional historiography (afaik the picture now is much less clear, but it's certainly true that large tribes like the Banu Hilal did migrate to the Maghreb at this time). This is also when we start to see Muslim majorities in Persia and the Fertile Crescent, probably sometime about the 11th century, so it's likely the process of Arabisation and Islamisation went hand-in-hand.

This isn't to say that Arabisation approached anything close to its modern day form in this period, the formation of the Arab identity is a very weird and complex beast that goes far beyond the scope of this question, but we can at least say that the 10th and 11th centuries represented fairly big shifts in middle Eastern demography."
"I pulled up an image of the [congressional record](https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=001/llac001.db&recNum=227) where this speech occurs and it is supposed to be ""Article 1st""."
"The second quote does not originate with Washington, but apparently comes from an opinion piece by someone named [C. S. Wheatley in 1926](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/26/firearm/).

The third quote is a paraphrase from Federalist #29, taken out of context. The original:
>Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped...

Hamilton here was saying that in the absence of a standing army, it was impractical to provide citizens with actual military training, so they would need provide their own weapons if they were to form a militia."
"I wrote my dissertation on Roman representations of Cleopatra in Literature and there are a few issues with this statement. First of all, Roman authors tend to not actually refer to Cleopatra as beautiful. Plutarch even says she is not as beautiful as Mark Antony's Wife Octavia (Plurarch, Life of Antony section 54?). What Roman authors do tend to say about Cleopatra as that she is power hungry, sexually promiscuous, and foreign to Rome. Propertius, Elegies 3.11 describes Cleopatra as a 'woman who fornicated even with her slaves. Virgil only describes her as an 'Egyptian wife' on the verge of suicide (Virgil, Aeneid,8.709) , and Horace says she is 'drunk', 'perverted', 'in a frenzy' and 'crazed' (Horace, Odes 1.37). Plutarch  says that she spoke several languages and, more importantly, specifically says that she managed the ruling of Alexandria and Egypt well! (Plutarch, Life of Antony,  27). The idea of Cleopatra being this beautiful woman tends to come from later cinema, think Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra (for more on this I would reccomend D.W Roller (2010) Cleopatra: A biography. To say that the ancient sources give us an entirely negative view of Cleopatra is false, but it is important to remember that Cleopatra is seen against a backgrop of Foreign, specificially Eastern, decadence, and against the power systems and political powers which were allowed of women in Ancient Rome. She tends to be painted as Manipulative rather than beautiful, alluring and dangerous rather than seductive. She is painted this way because her powers, being the Pharoh of Egypt, was so so far removed from the powers which would be allowed of Roman women in the Late Republic/Early empire that there was no way to assimilate her. Therefore, she tends to be painted like this. So yes, there is an element of Rome not ebing able to process a capable woman, but Cleopatra is not, and has never been 'made' beautiful by the ancient sources, we, as a modern society, have only inferred this from the sources. But it is important to remember that Cleopatra has been credited, even in ancient times, with cleverness, and an ability to rule. ETA: DISS LINK AT BOTTOM

> a show where Bart prominently calls his father 'Homer' rather than 'Dad', in some ways the ultimate denial of parental authority

Ok this intrigued me, but my question may be more cultural than historical. I'm French-Canadian and I call my parents by their proper names (always have, don't know why, they never minded). It often came as weird to my friends as old timey and overly respectful. But the way you write it, it sound like calling their parents their proper names was less respectful than mom and dad in the US.

So, was calling their parents by their real name always seen a less respectful in the English language or is it a new development?"
Thanks!
"And ancient Chinese do no have particles or space between words, combined with the extremely compacted way of writing it could be very confusing at times.

1. 民可使由之，不可使知之

"> By the First Crusade however, curved swords largely supplanted straight swords for military use in contemporary eastern cultures.

At the time of the First Crusade, curved swords were used in Central Asia (the early steppe sabre), and were seeing some use in China, and had recently come into use in Japan. In Western Asia, the double-edge straight sword was still supreme, and was used by both sides in the Crusades.

The spread of curved single-edged swords began in Central Asia in about the 7th century. Early of single-edged steppe swords included straight examples and forward-curved examples as well as ""normal"" backward-curved swords. These spread widely across the steppe, and appeared in Europe by the 10th century in the hands of steppe peoples (e.g., Cumans). One famous European example from this time is the ""Sabre of Charlemagne"":

* https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/jcvc8y/the_sabre_of_charlemagne/

The Song Dynasty saw a mix of straight and curved dao being used - early dao from the Han through to the Tang were usually straight. The increasing use of curved dao in China is usually attributed to Turko-Mongol influence, from the Mongols joining the Jin and Song and Xi Xia in their wars for the control of China. The Japanese switch from straight tachi to curved tachi appears to have begun earlier, and might be an entirely dependent development.

Elsewhere, the spread of the curved sabre appears to be closely linked to the spread of Turkic peoples, and their military employment. The curved sword became usual in Persia in the 15th century, and common in Eastern Europe and India in the 16th century (with straight swords continuing in use in both Eastern Europe and India alongside curved swords). Curved swords proceeded to spread across Europe from east to west, with the start of the 19th century seeing a mix of curved and straight swords in military use.

Part of the 18th century Western European shift to curved swords is due to cavalry becoming the major sword users. Infantry were the dominant group on the battlefield, but when the only infantry wearing swords are officers, and cavalry - troopers and officers alike - wear swords, the cavalry sword is the common sword, especially in terms of actual use as a weapon on the battlefield.

In at least some places (e.g., 17th century Europe), the adoption of the sabre in place of the straight sword coincides with a reduction in armour, and increased use of firearms. Together, these mean that there was less need for a sword point to find gaps in armour, which might have favoured sabres. However, in other places/times, there doesn't appear to be any connection with armour or firearms, so it isn't anything as simple as ""guns = less armour and fewer infantry swords = cavalry using curved swords"".

Finally, it should be noted that many curved swords had very little curvature - not enough to make any significant functional difference. For example, consider these late 19th century Qing cavalry swords:

"It's clearly the latter. PETA's goal is raising awareness and getting people to talk about these issues. Whether you agree with their tactics (I generally don't) or their tendency for hyperbole and shock (same), they absolutely to get people to fight for animal rights and make life annoying for industries that otherwise wouldn't naturally care about animal rights.

The Silver Spring case is an example here. Nowadays, you can't just start experimenting on animals without a serious bioethics review, and you need to explain what you plan to do, why, and why you **need** to be testing on an animal. They'll want you to use the minimum number of animals, give proper care, and do the absolute least amount of harm.  The downside is that the cost, paperwork, and time involved means that otherwise worthy studies never get off the ground. Whether that tradeoff is good is a matter of perspective, but as someone who works in the Pharma industry and has studied the darker history of American medicine, I believe that forcing industry and research institutions to affirmatively address bioethics is morally the right thing to do. And that wasn't just going to happen all on its own.

A good parallel is the NRA. There are a LOT of gun owners who dislike the NRA for being too hyperbolic, too absurdist, and basically assholes. But many of them at least respect the fact that the NRA will be there for their rights, and believe they'd rather have a fighting NRA out there as an absolutist than risk losing their rights.

So you have to judge those groups through a lens of your personal moral code as well how they effectively shift the conversation. Everyone's going to have a different perspective when you do that.

Also, PETA is pretty transparent about their funding and expenditures. (Unlike the NRA.) And many companies that do animal testing/animal raising run background checks and will blackball anyone with ties to PETA."

I think this has a lot to do with (historical) linguistics, so studying linguistics, I think I might be able to answer this.

The people whose descendants would pass on names like West or North didn't always use surnames. The Anglo-Saxons, like most Germanic people, originally had one given personal name. These names were more or less unique combinations of recurring elements (Æthelred means 'noble counsel'; Æthelwulf is a 'noble wolf') and were mostly not reused in communities, so that this one name was sufficient to definitively identify a person.

This only changed when the Anglo-Saxons came into contact with other peoples: the Norsemen and, later, the Normans. They brought with them their names and, importantly, their naming philosophies. Instead of relying on the constituents of the name (nobility, honor, strength, wolfs, ravens), they reused names of powerful figures so as to imbue the same characteristics of these honored ancestors onto their children. Multiple children having the same name leads to problems of identification, however. *""Which Erik are we talking about again?""* The obvious solution was to give by-names, i.e., secondary names derived from an identifying characteristic. *""You know, Eric the smith, Eric, the son of John, Eric with the brown hair, Eric who lives near the woods, or, of course, Eric who moved here from the North.""* I'm sure you can guess which surnames evolved from these characteristics. (As a fun aside, if your last name is King, your ancestor likely wasn't a king. Names of this type were most often derisive nicknames, mocking people acting like they're better than others.) These by-names stuck around and slowly evolved into the system of surnames in use today. In Germany, for example, this process was abetted by people moving into towns. In these larger settlements, there'd of course be more than one Wolfram or Martin. These newcomers were often identified by whence they came (a region, another settlement, or just the general direction).

So now that we understand why the cardinal directions turned into surnames, why are East and South less common than North and West? Well, that's where linguistics comes into play. As I explained, the process of acquiring surnames started when the Anglo-Saxons had prolonged contact with the Norsemen and the Normans, i.e., the time from the 8th to the 11th century. And people in the 8th to 11th century spoke a version of English that is quite different from the one in use today. Let's look at the Old English (OE) words for the compass directions (OE forms taken from the Oxford English dictionary):

North -- norð (ð being a ligature for a th-sound)

West -- west

South -- suð

East -- east, eastan, æst (æ being a ligature for the a-sound in, e.g., 'cat')

   
As you can see, if we ignore the ligatures for a moment, the words for North and West changed much less than those for South and East. This means that there are a lot of surnames derived from the latter two that don't make this etymology obvious. Aston is someone from an eastern place, for example, and the Sutherlands at one point in time lived in southern lands. Sutton is someone from a southern enclosure, i.e., a settlement or town ('town', like '-ton' comes from 'tun', a word describing an enclosed settlement -- cf. German 'Zaun' meaning 'fence'; 'tun' can also be a generic name for any settlement). So while someone from the North or West might have been called exactly that in 900 AD, someone from the South or East might have received a name much less familiar to us now.

There could of course be different reasons that other people might be able to explain. But I hope that I have illuminated some of the linguistic processes that likely have contributed to the discrepancy that we find today.

"The premise of this question is incorrect. At no point in the song is there a lyric that implies the skaters are low on the social pecking order.

What the lyrics do describe are two separate social niches. The titular skater boy is a punk, and the girl who is initially interested in him is a ballerina. Her friends, presumably other ballet type girls, don’t consider the skaters someone worthy of dating, because the skaters were punks and wore baggy clothes. This makes sense if young ballerinas conceive of themselves as belonging to a refined, classy profession. For more on the way ballet has been perceived, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hlz5a/comment/cavp5lp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) an (old) answer by [/u/Pizzaboxpackaging](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pizzaboxpackaging/). 

The song doesn't describe the ballerinas as being popular, or looking down on the skaters because they are losers. It is simply the case that group social dynamics in this high school setting preclude one from associating with an out-group judged incompatible, regardless of where the two groups sit in a school-wide pecking order. 

While skaters in a given school may or may not be regarded as popular, since the lyrics describe a typically feminine profession looking down on a typically male archetype, the dynamic at play may instead be more focused on gender norms, rather than social pecking order per se. Kelly (2005) describes girls who try to involve themselves in the skater or punk subculture. In this study, skaters are specifically described as being among the cool people in school. Buckingham (2009) describes skater culture as having been used by clothing manufacturers to convey an image of 'cool' in marketing to a broader audience. All of which is to say, there is no indication that I could find that skaters were at all considered uncool, at least among the trendy press of North America. 

So, to reiterate my original point: the skater boy was not considered undateable because he was low on the social pecking order. He was considered undateable because the girl who liked him was in a group that considered themselves too proper to date someone from a grungy subculture.

">Not only that, but as the Romans relied more and more heavily on German foederati (allied/mercenary confederations hired in war), those foedarati become more internally united.

First of all they really didn't, not until the very end at least. Substantial evidence for the Roman army is present archaeologically until about 450.

Second of all it's hard to call them allied/mercenary confederations. They were more like... client field armies. In fact the entire process of their (non-)settlement and payment was effectively nearly the same as the Roman army, where they were granted allotments of tax revenue on assessable lands (the army was granted allotments of tax revenue on assessable citizens under Constantine)."

"PART II

So in sum, throughout the 1920s you really didn't have all that much to fear from the legal system.

This changed in March 1929 when Coolidge at the end of the lame duck session signed the Jones Act (more often referred to as the Jones-Stalker Law or the Increased Penalties Act to differentiate itself from the Jones Act dealing with vessel flagging that still exists today), which changed Volstead punishments from misdemeanors to felonies, raised the potential punishment even for a first offense from six months to five years and raised fines from $1,000 to $10,000, and allowed you the chance to work off the fine at $1 a day while still behind bars - or in theory, 27 years.

Okrent traces the beginning of the end of Prohibition to the passage of the Jones Act given its draconian punishments for something most people were doing with a wink and a nod, but in some cases the states were even worse.

>But the case that drew the most intense response, in Chicago and elsewhere, unspooled in Lansing, Michigan, just miles from the state capitol building, where dry legislators had outdone Congress with a law mandating a life sentence for a fourth violation of the liquor laws. A couple of men had already been imprisoned under this draconian statute, but the arrest, conviction, and sentencing of Mrs. Etta Mae Miller—all of which occurred while Wesley Jones was carrying Bishop Cannon’s pet bill through Congress—became the apotheosis of enforcement excess. Mrs. Miller was forty-eight. She had ten children. Her husband was already serving time on a Volstead conviction. But her fourth violation was her fourth violation, and the state law requiring a life term was indifferent to the fact that Etta Mae Miller’s crime was the sale of two pints of liquor to an undercover cop.  

>Three comments—two made directly in response to the Miller case, one uttered around the same time in reference to the general state of the Prohibition laws—embodied the general reaction. Time magazine said, “In the same court on the same day” that Miller was sentenced to prison for the rest of her natural life, “a bellboy had pleaded guilty to manslaughter [and] had been fined $400 and freed.” Dr. Clarence True Wilson of the Methodist Board of Temperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals said, “Our only regret is that the woman was not sentenced to life imprisonment before her ten children were born.” And the new president, just one month into his term, told a group of editors that if a law is appropriate, “its enforcement is the quickest method of compelling respect for it.” But Herbert Hoover also said, “If a law is wrong, its rigid enforcement is the surest guarantee of its repeal.”

Miller's case was reversed by the Michigan Supreme Court in early 1930 and she was released, but the damage had been done.  With 1/6th of federal tax revenues in 1919 having essentially been transferred to gangsters, Prohibition faced both practical and financial reasons for repeal when the Great Depression went full bore.

So how does all of this relate to the fate of those convicted?  Well, first off, given the different jurisdictions it becomes massively more difficult to determine what exactly happened to those on the state level with the exception of cause celebre cases like the Miller one.  In fact, even on the federal level with better documentation, Okrent references only a single specific pardon issued by FDR - to the owners of the 21 Club in New York - which appears to have been issued because the existing conviction prevented the owners from obtaining a gun permit, and which Okrent only discovered through a letter preserved by the family of the owner.  Given the minor punishments surrounding the convictions of the 1920s, it's quite possible that these were the majority of cases which received pardons, with the initial recipients probably being well connected individuals that needed a clean record.  Later, [one J.W. Horning](https://historical.ha.com/itm/autographs/u.s.-presidents/franklin-d-roosevelt-partly-printed-pardon-signed-franklin-d-roosevelt-as-president-and-francis-biddle-as/a/658-25546.s) finally received a pardon in 1941 after being jailed for a month in 1929 because he couldn't pay the $250 fine imposed for some Volstead violation, with the details of the original case being lost to history.

But there's a sadder side to why I can't provide a better answer on exact details.  The one academic who provided much of the really robust pardon data for articles like [this in the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/a-more-historic-act-of-clemency/398468/) - which has a very interesting graph on the amount of liquor related pardons issued - [murdered his two children in 2018 before killing himself](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-now/a-pardon-expert-emailed-me-his-lifes-work-before-killing-his-two-sons-and-himself/465-79c76e9d-c866-4d39-98cc-cc2f7e20717d).

"I am currently writing a paper on the ways in which the Spanish flu was described and interpreted theologically in Swedish, christian newspapers. The year 1918, or ''the times'' in general, were typically depicted as incredibly tough even though Sweden was not directly involved in the war. In their internal magazine, the priests of the Church of Sweden struggled with the question of how they could provide moral support when everything seemed to go so terribly. In a ''Letter to the youth'' in the newspaper *Församlingsbladet,* an author that is not named writes that

&#x200B;

 ''I will never forget a 16-year old boy I encountered. He did not cry, as he was not able to do so, but with the full force of his young, sensitive souls capacity to suffer, his eyes expressed pain over the fact that: -The world is so full of suffering. You are tempted to feel bad about the people born in this time who are not allowed to be young the same way that we in the older generation were, uninhibited in our happiness about the small moments of joy in life, believing that it all was one big, beautiful adventure. ''

&#x200B;

A lot of people expressed shock at the fact that issues they thought belonged to the past, such as hunger and war, now had become more threatening than ever. Priests such as Lewis K Johnsson interpreted it as the end of days since all the terrors of the apocalypse according to his analysis were present. However, I would like to note that in the source material I have studied, the pandemic tended to fall into the shadow of the First World War, most often being mentioned as a side note to it. This is also noted by Margareta Åman, a Swedish expert on the Spanish Flu. Even though the pandemic would claim more lives than the war, the world was relatively used to diseases. Cholera, for example, killed large numbers of people every year. Even though the Spanish flu was more widespread than anything previously witnessed, it was part of a more regular pattern of deadly outbreaks of diseases. The war, on the other hand, is almost always described as something historically unique due to its sheer size. It was also viewed as more tragic due to the fact that it was in the control of man, while diseases often were seen as unstoppable. Some regulations on public meetings, movie theatres etc were instituted, but most people seemed to live on as usual until they caught it. But in general, people (especially young people) went through incredibly challenging times."

***Part 4: Defining Socialism***

That, however, is not the last word. Beauty was an educational and propaganda tool, but what is beauty? (Philosophy 101, down the hall.) Seriously, though, who gets to decide what beauty is, what good aesthetic taste is, what good proletarian culture is, what the proletariat's taste should be educated *towards*, and what the shining, brilliant future looks like? What I mean is, there is a whole 'nother thing we need to talk about, which is the Metro’s role in codifying aesthetic and political norms.

In 1924, when that Metro plan I mentioned above began to be drawn up, one of the men in charge was one Semyon Nikolaevich Rozanov. He was deputy of a small sub-department of MGZhD (the Directorate of Moscow Urban Railways) dedicated to drawing up that plan. He was an engineer by trade, and he had been educated before the revolution, so during the Civil War, he fled to France, where he worked on the Paris Metro.^1 ^Correction! ^See ^below. He was one of the few people in the USSR in the 1920s with any kind of experience building mass transit. And in 1930, they threw him in prison.

Metro construction is, and was, political. I mean, everything I've said so far is adjacent to politics, sure, but here is where it becomes *explicitly* political. During the 1920s, there was a running battle being waged over the political future of the USSR, with three major factions that we have to worry about: the Right, the Left, and the Center.

* **The Right** was associated with bourgeois tendencies in art and literature; they were still by any liberal definition leftists and radical socialists, but they tended to favor more moderate change, and were not thrilled with collectivization and dekulakization, which uprooted the peasantry, for whom, Stalin thought, they had an unacceptable level of tolerance. They liked the semi-capitalist approach of the NEP and wanted to keep it.

* **The Left** was absolutely radical by the standards of the day, and even by some Soviet standards; they were interested in proletarian internationalism, in bringing revolution to the rest of the world, and initiating a complete rethinking of the concept of culture. The avant-garde art movements shared a lot of overlap with these Leftists because of their commitment to exploring and spreading that new culture.

* **The Center**, composed of Stalin and other bureaucratic-tending party and state officials, were committed to industrializing and collectivizing the USSR and strengthening socialism within one country. Their artistic and cultural program was… well, this debate is where it's about to come from.

Rozanov was believed by Stalin and the Left to be a so-called ""bourgeois expert"". He was from an older time, and Stalin and Kaganovich were concerned that he brought with him ideas from that older time. Everything that Rozanov did between 1924 and 1928 with his small MGZhD sub-department was suspect for that reason. It didn't help that, at this point, the very idea of subway construction was seen to be a Rightist tendency. That may be a shock, knowing what we know now about the existing socialist Metro systems and about the socialist love for mass transit (and BreadTube's penchant for ""train good, car bad"", which, let's be fair, is really funny). But let's forget everything we know about socialism and subways and go back to the 1920s.

Part 4A: Okay But Defining Socialism For Real Now

Poof, it is the mid-1920s. Who has cities with subway systems? The West. In order of opening, it was the UK, the US, Hungary, France, Germany, Greece, and Spain. A bunch of capitalist pigs. And it stands to reason that the concept of the subway is just as outdated and unjust as the concept of capitalism, right? After all, what do subways do? They herd a bunch of poor, starving workers into a dark, smelly little room, where they get into a loud, uncomfortable little box, which takes them to their place of work, and this whole system was built specifically by capitalists so that an ever-larger radius of land can house ever more people to work in their factories. Subways are counterrevolutionary tools of the bourgeoisie. Or at least in 1924, there are plenty of people who think so.

From 1921, the post of First Secretary of the Moscow Party Committee (Kaganovich's eventual role from 1930 to 1934) had been held by a Leftist, until Stalin had him replaced in 1924 with a man named Nikolai Uglanov. Uglanov wasn't a particularly doctrinaire rightist, but under his leadership, Rightism did gain ground in Mossovet's decision-making, and in 1928, when Stalin was both sufficiently worried by that fact and sufficiently concerned that Uglanov was gaining support with the people of Moscow, Stalin had him removed too, as part of a widespread but comparatively humane purge of Moscow leadership. No executions, that is.

In late 1928, it had been announced that the Rozanov Metro plan was ready for construction to begin in 1929, and this prompted protests that the Metro was being built before the housing crisis was addressed. During Uglanov's removal, Stalin and the Centrists cited these protests as evidence that Uglanov was pursuing bourgeois policies that harmed the people of Moscow. I suspect that the protests were genuine, because the housing shortage, again, was terrible, but the effect of the demonstration was very much manipulated by Stalin to remove the Right Opposition from Moscow. Rozanov and his department were accused of working ""undemocratically"", planning a superfluous bourgeois Metro behind closed doors. Essentially, the MGZhD department was a casualty of political maneuvering.

As a result, Metro construction was thoroughly discredited, Rozanov's plans were shelved, and he went to prison in 1930. Now, the Left came to prominence, and in a big way. The period from 1928 to 1931 is what Sheila Fitzpatrick called the ""Cultural Revolution"", but which even she would probably now qualify as ""the height of the Cultural Revolution"". Stalin didn't ""unleash"" it, as some people mistakenly say, but for three years he tolerated it. This period sees an even greater emphasis on literacy and cultural education than before, as well as explosion of radical thought in all domains, from gender relations to linguistic policy to, importantly for us, aesthetics and urban planning.

There is an intense debate going on at this time over the proper aesthetic of socialism. In conjunction with the avant-garde aesthetic, a lot of Leftists argued for simple but refined, mass-producible domestic goods and public representations. The idea was that ornamentation was a sign of bourgeois taste, a holdover from the pre-revolutionary days. Meanwhile, there is a similar current in urban planning, with the movement known as *anti-urbanism*. Anti-urbanists went in multiple different directions, but what they shared was a belief that cities were a result of capitalist production, in decentralization, and often in re-greening the city.

However, neither of these things was in line with Stalin's vision. Stalin and the Center did not want to transcend national and bourgeois aesthetics; they wanted to encourage pride in national culture throughout the USSR. Instead of abolishing bourgeois taste and replacing it with a new, avant-garde sensibility, they wanted to extend its availability to everybody. They did not want to decentralize the city; they wanted to further cement its centralization in the name of industrializing the USSR and making it self-sufficient. And rather than turning the proletariat into an entirely new, de-urbanized class, they wanted to celebrate the urban, industrial labor that built a powerful, industrially competitive Soviet Union.

By 1931, it had been a little while since the purge of the Rightists, and their threat to the Center was fading from memory. Stalin and the Centrists came to the decision that the Leftists and their anti-urbanist, Avant-gardist, radical feminist ideas were now the problem threatening to get out of hand. That, combined with the still-increasing migration to Moscow, congestion, and the growing importance of redesigning Moscow to be a capital ""worthy of the proletarian state"", in Kaganovich's words, all came together in the suppression of Leftism. That campaign goes much beyond the question of the Metro, but the Metro was one of its battles. A pseudonymous article appeared in *Izvestiya* in May of 1931 forcefully criticizing the idea that congestion could be solved through trams alone, and in the June Plenum of the Central Committee, Kaganovich made a speech outlining a complete reconstruction of Moscow, including the construction of a Metro, citing the reasons I discussed above: improving Muscovites' lives, comfort, sticking it to the West, and creating a symbol of socialism.

And that is the point of this big excursion into the Rightists and Leftists and anti-urbanists, oh my. The construction of the Metro was an assertion of a particular aesthetic style and a political position to match it. The architectural style, with its eclectic mash of Greco-Roman, Modernist-but-not-too-avant-garde, and Russian folk elements, is commonly called ""Stalinist (Neo-)Classicism"", or *Stalinskiy ampir* in Russian. (Yes, that comes from ""empire"". The Greco-Roman motif is another answer in itself.) The aesthetic style in general is called ""Socialist Realism"".

The political position is called... well, my TL;DR is: the Metro wasn't just a symbol of any old socialism. It was a symbol of *Stalinism*.
___
This is just the beginning of the story of the Metro, of course. I haven't touched on Khrushchev's role in the process of construction at all, or the architects' own visions and how they were influenced by Stalin and Kaganovich. But I think it's best to leave those for a follow-up, which I will gladly answer, but after I get this answer out into the real world to fend for itself do a little more real-life work."
"PART I

To start, unless they were prosecuted after 1929 they probably wouldn't have been there in the first place.

Let's go back a decade to explain why this was the case.  The Volstead Act - the legislation providing the nominal teeth to provide a method to enforce Prohibition on the federal level - had a structural weakness that essentially doomed it from the start even if everything else surrounding Prohibition had worked: it required jury trials.

To say this overwhelmed the Federal Court system and made punishment under Volstead laughable doesn't even come close.  From Daniel Okrent:

>""One of the nobler aspects of the Volstead Act was its guarantee of the right to a jury trial for anyone charged with a violation. It was a requirement, it soon turned out, that the legal system was incapable of handling...Mabel Willebrandt [one of the most aggressive prosecutors of Prohibition] acknowledged that “juries will not convict if the punishment does not fit the crime,” and she was proven right in city after city, as juries effectively nullified the law because they didn’t think any punishment at all was appropriate for breaking the liquor laws. After Smedley Butler was fired as director of public safety in Philadelphia, he offered a statistic that was simultaneously a boast and an admission of defeat: in two years, his police force had made 227,000 liquor violation arrests. To Old Gimlet Eye, this indicated that his men had nabbed 15 percent of the city’s population; to anyone else, it indicated that they had arrested the same people over and over and over again.

Or as one district judge in New York put it to a Prohibition violator in the mid 1920s, ""You have been brought before me twelve times in twelve months for violations of the Volstead Act. What do you have to say?"" His reply: ""Your Honor, I can't help it if you're not promoted.""

This led to what was essentially chaos in the court system for a decade, especially since Dry advocates used conviction numbers as a brute force yardstick to measure prosecutorial effectiveness; the Southern District US attorney in New York was expected to clear 10,000 cases annually.

>""Proceedings were conducted without court stenographers or clerks. Six judges and one magistrate were expected to dispose of fifty thousand cases annually. Even if each had worked full time on nothing but Volstead cases, together they would have been able to handle fewer than four thousand a year—and had they done that, no other federal matter would have been adjudicated anywhere in the district, which stretched all the way to Albany...by one accounting, U.S. attorneys across the country spent, at minimum, 44 percent of their time and resources on Prohibition prosecutions—if that was the word for the pallid efforts they were able to sustain on such limited resources. In North Carolina and West Virginia, the federal prosecutors devoted 70 percent of their time to Prohibition violations; in Minnesota, 60 percent; in southern Alabama—where Mabel Willebrandt would directly supervise one of the most aggressive enforcement efforts in the nation—Volstead prosecutions consumed a staggering 90 percent of the federal docket.""

What this led to in turn was a shortcut: the vast majority of cases - which were misdemeanors anyway - were plea bargained out for a guilty verdict and a nominal fine, and if you were crazy enough to actually bring something to a jury trial, then as one prosecutor put it, ""The fixers, he said, were found even in the men’s rooms, attempting to bribe jurors hearing those few cases that made it to trial. In the courtrooms crooked lawyers encouraged perjury.""  In addition given the terrible training and miniscule expenditure on Prohibition Agents - presuming they weren't already felons when they signed up, where by 1930 almost 10% had been fired for lying on their applications for previous convictions, which doesn't even begin to cover those taking bribes - the police work was generally terrible and the courts often had field days with fourth amendment violations, and had legal implications that still exist today.  Last but not least, at the beginning of the 1920s there were a grand total of three federal prisons throughout the country - so where exactly were you going to put all the miscreants?

So this led to such scenes as ""thousands of Volstead violators were...(delivered) by the wagonful to the badly degraded Federal Court in downtown Manhattan. This led the (US attorney for the region) to concoct an opportunity that quickly became known as “Bargain Day.” Publicly promising to request light fines in exchange for guilty pleas, he invited defendants to the Old Post Office Building south of City Hall, where his staff, working with two cooperative federal judges, could process five hundred cases at a time and clear up the backlog.""  While the fines were often small, usually ranging between $5-$250 (the former for consumers, the latter viewed as a cost of doing business by the providers), the numbers added up: in the Northern District of New York, in 1925 and 1926 a single judge assessed $2.5 million in fines for Volstead violations, or the better part of $40 million today.  Incidentally, this is one reason my second favorite scene of *Boardwalk Empire* (the first being Nucky Thompson declaring 'that imbicile is going to be the next President of the United States!' when he hears Harding has received the nomination) is the one in which the Mabel Willebrand-inspired prosecutor is shocked to discover she finally has a shot at Nucky in court and attempts to throw the book at him - and the exhausted judge working at 2 am looks for 10 seconds at the evidence he's actually arrested for and fines him something like $5.  While the scene is of course entirely fictional, it's also a decently accurate representation of the general futility of Volstead era prosecutions; in fact, one of the few judges who decided to actually try to enforce the law as intended and who had used sightseeing buses to round up prisoners actually went insane after two years of doing so and ended up killing himself.

But that was just in Federal Court.

One of the nuttier aspects of the Eighteenth Amendment was that it allowed concurrent jurisdiction between the Feds and the States with the expectation by the Drys that State governments would step up.  As you'd expect, this didn't quite work out uniformly.  From Okrent again:

>The peculiar second clause of the Eighteenth Amendment, assigning “concurrent” enforcement power to the federal government and to the states, mandated (or at least encouraged) armies of cops across the nation to stand shoulder to shoulder in the booze wars. The relative strength of the Anti-Saloon League in various parts of the country could be measured by the proliferation of state laws designed to be “concurrent” with the federal strictures. Anyone arrested for insobriety in Vermont was subject to a mandatory jail sentence if he failed to name the person from whom he acquired his liquor. At one point Indiana vested train conductors and bus drivers with the authority to arrest passengers carrying alcohol and made it illegal for retailers to put flasks or cocktail shakers in their shop windows. Mississippi decreed debts related to the acquisition of intoxicating beverages uncollectible. Iowa banned the sale of Sterno, from which alcohol could be extracted by filtering it through a rag or, among drunks with better table manners, through a loaf of bread...only eighteen states bothered to appropriate as much as a dollar for enforcement. In some jurisdictions this reflected a distaste for the whole business; New York repealed its state enforcement code in 1923, and Maryland never even bothered to enact one.

One great example of just how even true believers were restricted comes from Pennsylvania, where Gifford Pinchot - the legendary founder of the Park Service - got himself elected Governor on a Dry Platform.

>In his first month in office he turned the state police into a commando army. A single week saw raids on illegal liquor operations in eighteen counties. Reminding Republican legislators that he was now head of the party, that he had led them to victory at the top of the ticket in November, and that they had pledged their support to his legislative program, Pinchot got all the laws he wanted. Swollen with the pride of a triumphalist, gleaming with the righteousness of a reformer, Pinchot announced that he had achieved his legislative success without making a single promise in exchange for a vote. “This is an unbought victory,” he proclaimed, “and ten times as valuable on that account.”  Unbought, perhaps, but unfunded as well. After Pinchot’s glorious moment had passed, the legislators who had gone along with his program stiffened. It was one thing for the Pennsylvania legislature—any legislature, really—to give militant drys the laws they wanted, but quite another to provide the funds necessary for their enforcement. As a result, the legislators decided that the total appropriation for Pinchot’s ambitious program should amount to precisely...zero."

"I should probably be clear that the Olympic events were not entirely fixed and there was probably some variation across time. That being said, the central aspect of the Olympic competitions was individual military quality. They tested martial excellence: for example the javelin throw and race in armor are pretty obvious, but also the long jump tested the ability to clear obstacles on the battlefield.

This means the Greeks would be quietly horrified that *archery* is an event.

EDIT: Worth noting the modern games also often have a martial origin. Dressage is pretty famous in this respect, but I'm currently watching the steeeplechase which strikes me as having a martial cast as well."

"This answer can change quite a bit depending on which historians you're talking about. I can't speak for Westerners, but the opening of the archives radically changed the burgeoning Soviet/Russian humanities.

Before we begin, it's important to note that the opening of the archives wasn't a sudden shocking event - it had several years of buildup. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost (""openness"") shook the tiny circle of Russian social scientists to their core. For several decades the USSR had been funneling resources in academia towards what we would today consider STEM courses, at the expense of social sciences. Additionally, strict censorship laws prevented too much intellectual exploration. If you wanted to get big into academia in the Soviet Union, then you would aspire to be what was known as a ""fortochka"". A fortochka is literally a type of window found almost exclusively in Eastern Europe, that is designed to let air into a room without compromising the room's temperature. This is obviously incredibly useful in a stuffy room in the middle of a blistering Russian winter. However, certain social scientists and academics became known as intellectual fortochkas, in that they criticized the government and got away with it, because the criticisms they would make wouldn't be radical enough to cause any serious change. They could bring in new ideas and theories without compromising the Soviet system, much like an actual fortochka lets in cool air without compromising the indoor climate.

Gorbachev's glasnost resulted in a boom in the social sciences, as now there was more room for more dissenting opinions and ideas. Fortochkas began popping up all over, and as they did many began to make a startling discovery: the Soviet Union was woefully behind the rest of the world in terms of the humanities. Psychology had basically not progressed since Freud, and many new areas of studies simply did not exist (eg. Women's Studies was virtually, if not literally, nonexistent in Soviet universities). Accompanying these discoveries was a sense of national shame and humiliation. Ever since early schooling many Russian children were implicitly taught that Russia was first among equals within the Soviet Union in particular and the world in general. From a young age many were taught about the great successes had by the USSR during the Great Patriotic War (WW2) and how the Soviet Union was the most powerful nation on earth. The policy of glasnost shattered these illusions. A poll conducted in the late 1990s in Russia showed how the average Russian, despite being materially better off than they were ten years prior, felt they had it worse. The poll conductors chalked this up to Russians now comparing themselves to the rest of the world.

Compounding this was the release of many previously classified documents involving and sometimes authored by Stalin. The vast majority were simple, boring, administrative papers and memos. However, several provided what was at the time a shocking revelation in Russia: the extent of the gulag system and executions. What was new wasn't so much the information - the gulags and executions were hardly a secret - but the scale and perceived heartlessness of Stalin. Long lists of names put forth for execution with simple ticks next to them appalled many of the Russian intellegentsia. Former party officials who released the documents and conducted investigations were said to be shocked and deeply saddened, as not even many high-ranking party members were privy to this information beforehand.

But getting back to your original question, I wouldn't say the growing transparency or declassification of archives *radically* changed perceptions of previous events, but it did create a sense of shame and fear of being left behind within Russian academia and intellegentsia.

"Interesting questions. Let us break the answer into different countries, so that we may understand their motives for backing different sides, be them economic, ideologic or of allegiances in nature.

&#x200B;

**France and the United Kingdom:** 

&#x200B;

They were on opposite sides for several reasons, perhaps the main of them being oil interests, therefore their motives are fundamentally *economic.* According to Prof. Chibuike Uche in ""*Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War"",* a corporate conglomerate comprised of Shell and British Petroleum were in control of more than 80% of Nigeria's oil production, therefore making a priority for the British government to ensure their supply of oil wasn't jeopardized by the hostilities. They didn't however actively support the Nigerian Federal Military Government (FMG) until the latter imposed a blocade to oil exports, forcing both Shell-BP and the British government to pick a side. Per a recommendation of the High Commissioner to Nigeria sir David Hunt to the British Foreign Secretary Baron George-Brown, they decided to back the FMG (albeit covertly in the case of the British government, which didn't publicly disclaim the actual amount of weaponry they supplied to the Nigerian FMG).

&#x200B;

On the other side, the French decided to back Biafra for different reasons. One of them concerns, as in the British case, oil. In *French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War*, Christopher Griffin explains that according to a CIA report, France had backed Biafra because of a prior agreement, by which Biafra ceded the percentage of the Nigerian oil production that a French company claimed to own. On a political and ideological level, France's support of Biafra stemmed from the decolonization process France had to go through after internal and international pressure during the second presidency of Charles de Gaulle. Even though French colonies gained official independence, unoficially they were still under de facto control of the French Government, due mostly to economic factors. Looking to extend their sphere of influence in Africa, France urged some of its former colonies such as Gabon and Côte d'Ivoire to support the Biafran cause.

&#x200B;

**USSR and US:**

&#x200B;

Let me first say that saying that these two countries were ""on the same side"" isn't necessarily accurate. Simply because they didn't oppose each other, doesn't mean, from a geopolitological analysis, that they agreed with each other.

&#x200B;

The US remained neutral in the conflict, essentially due to their alliance with the United Kingdom from a political viewpoint, and, once again, due to the importance of private oil interests in the region, held by Gulf Oil, which was one of the biggest oil producing companies in the planet.

&#x200B;

The USSR on the other hand, didn't remain neutral. Quite on the contrary, they supported the Federal Military Government. This was and continues to be viewed as a peculiar decision, because it didn't coincide with the ideology of marxism-leninism. Had it followed said ideas, the USSR should've perhaps supported the Biafran cause. However, international relations and foreign policy expert, with an emphasis in Russian foreign policy, Angela Stent, has an explanation as to why the USSR decided to go against its ideology and focus on pragmatism instead. In her 1973 essay *The Soviet Union and the Nigerian Civil War: A Triumph of Realism,* Stent argues that the Central Committee of the Communist Party decided to side with the FMG because of a realist principle.

On the one hand, ""Nigeria was probably one of the most consistently anti-Soviet and pro-West countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in the 1960s"". This made establishing diplomatic relations an arduous task. When the war broke, the USSR saw an opportunity to further improve their incipient relations with Nigeria. On the other, the pragmatic way forward was to intercede in favor of the FMG, because the USSR also opposed any form of secessionism.

&#x200B;

**Israel**:

&#x200B;

Zach Levey, of the School of Political Sciences of the University of Haifa, describes why the Israeli government acted as a double agent of sorts in *Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war, 1967–70*. 

&#x200B;

Israel stood by the FMG by selling them weapons, because they sought to avoid a rupture in relations with Nigeria, which Israel understood ""would have affected Israel's position in all of black Africa"". However, the Knesset, the Israeli legislature, was pressured by the Israeli people, because ""the plight of the Igbos reminded many Israelis of the Holocaust"". As a result, Israel decided to, clandestinely, send aid to Biafra in the form of arms as well as humanitarian assistance and money.

&#x200B;

**The Vatican**:

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, I didn't have previous knowledge regarding the Vatican's involvement, aside from the fact that they were indeed involved. I found that there isn't much information available at first glance on the Vatican's part in the war. However, upon further research I found two interesting things. Firstly, the website for the Embassy of Nigeria to the Holy See. In a section narrating the history of their bilateral relations, it, rather briefly, describes the Vatican's involvement through CARITAS Internationalis, which provided humanitarian relief to Biafra. The website goes on to say that the period of the war ""was not the period for diplomatic jaw-jaw"" between Nigeria and the Holy See.

&#x200B;

Secondly, on a more historical note, I found an article from The New York Times, from January 14, 1970. It describes the FMG's denunciation of the Vatican for the previously mentioned aid to Biafra, as well as for a comment by Pope Paul VI, who spoke of ""the possibility of genocide of the Ibo people"". It also states that Major General Yakubu Gowon, Nigeria's military leader and head of state, said in a radio interview, in reference to the Holy See's involvement of the war:  ""The federal military Government recalls the role of the Vatican throughout the Nigerian crisis, sustaining the rebels with money and Vital supplies and transportation links with the outside world. (...) The role of the Vatican has had the tragic consequence of prolonging rebel resistance, leading to the deaths of many innocent people and distress for the population in those areas."""

##So what does all this mean?

Looking at these specific instances of government, warfare, religious freedom, and criminal justice, we now have a fuller picture of what life could've looked like before the coming of Europeans to the Americas. Cosmological observances and tenets delivered philosophical understandings and this developed into a group's culture. This culture informed their way of life and observing this way of life helps us to see what were the motives for why and how certain things where done. Seeing these things, we can now view it from their perspective. Whether or not things were ""easier"" or ""idyllic"" is based on perspective and is largely subjective. Their ways of life were idyllic to whatever their standards of such concepts were. Today, I would be hard pressed to believe that many would choose to live back then, but I say that knowing most probably do not understand what life was like before colonization and assume things based off what the mainstream narrative tells them: Native Peoples were simple and carefree, in tune with Nature and unaware of what they did, thus they had no worries of the like we do today with our advanced understanding and deep thoughts and economics and...stuff (/s). This myth, this idea of the Noble Savage, is definitely false. However, it is false because of how it was developed. Native Peoples were much more receptive and in balance in the Natural World, but that is because the Natural World *is* their world. It is their reality. This acknowledgement, when understood from their cultural perspectives, allowed them to work within the boundaries we today no longer follow.

Easy hunting and simple living are things being defined by the now. What we consider to be easy hunting might not have been for the Indigenous Peoples back then who had to chase down wild game before the introduction of the horse (if one chooses to believe the story of the horse). What we consider to be simple living probably wasn't so simple when we realize Indigenous Peoples dealt with many of the very things we do today: politics, religion, war, government, economics, and family. What we can say for certain though is that even if things were (or were not) simple, easy, and idyllic, the time before colonization was most definitely different.

**Endnotes**

^1 The Noble Savage myth is the idea that Indigenous Peoples were overly simple and primitive, leading them to be more peaceful, balanced, virtuous, and idealistic, uncorrupted by modern civilization and living in accordance with Nature, essentially wild or: noble. This idea is inaccurate because it is primarily based off Western observation of Indigenous Peoples out of context with an application of racial superiority and standards of ""civilized"" living. These notions stem from Euro-American perspectives of society and advancement. The reality is that many Indigenous Peoples had complex societies with structured institutions and organized populaces. The Noble Savage, on the other hand, is ideal because it is primitive and unbarred from the industrial world, letting humans ultimately return to what we all were in the beginning, that being Indigenous. Unfortunately, the concept is based in ignorance and racism.

^2 Tribes today in the United States, as polities, can still choose to banish individuals from their lands (i.e., reservations). This includes both Tribal citizens and non-Indians.

However, I haven't been able to find any evidence of whether hippies were indeed refused service on a large scale, or whether it was simply a memetic and quasi-humorous backlash analogous to modern griping about hipsters.

Approaching things from the other direction, I was able to find some evidence that poor, rural people in the Great Depression, perhaps particularly Black people, might be unable to afford shoes, shirts, or other adequate clothing.

However, I wasn't able to find much evidence of widespread shirtlessness/shoelessness due to poverty by the 1960s, very possibly because I wasn't quite sure where to look. For instance, [Robert Kennedy's visit to the Mississippi Delta](http://www.jimlucasphotography.com/civil-rights-movement-in-mississippi-1964-1968/1967-robert-f-kennedys-visit-to-the-mississippi-delta/) seems to have few photographs of barefooted people, even though the population was extremely poor and malnourished.

Does it seem more probable that ""no shoes, no shirt, no service"" signs were related to the hippie sub-culture, or to oblique discrimination based on race and class?"

"While /u/chadtr5 gives a good answer and /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov offers some excellent context, I'll give a bit of a different perspective than chadtr5. This coincides with what Georgy_K_Zhukov wrote about:

There is no question that loyalty to Virginia is absolutely the justification Lee cited before joining the Confederacy, as well as at the time he joined the Confederacy, and he continued to make the claim after the war was over. However, Lee's claim comes with some considerable caveats.

Robert E. Lee is first known to have expressed this justification in a letter to his son dated January 23, 1861, after five states had already seceded:

> ""If the Union is dissolved and the Government disrupted, I shall return to my native State and share the miseries of my people, and, save in defense will draw my sword on none.""

On April 18, 1861, he had a meeting with Winfield Scott, the Commanding General of the U.S. Army (and, incidentally, a fellow Virginian who stayed loyal to the United States). By all accounts, the meeting seemed to be to warn Lee off of resigning and joining the Confederacy. It would seem, then, there were already suspicions about what Lee intended to do—he had met with Francis Preston Blair four days earlier to talk about his military future, whereupon Lee had been noncommittal. On April 20, 1861, two days after his meeting with Scott, Lee resigned from the U.S. Army. He wrote a resignation letter to Scott in which he stated:

> ""Save in defense of my native State, I never desire again to draw my sword.""

On the same day, he wrote a letter to his sister and another to his brother. The letter to his sister read in part:

> ""With all my devotion to the Union, and the feeling of loyalty and duty of an American citizen, I have not been able to make up my mind to raise my hand against my relative, my children, my home.   I have, therefore, resigned my commission in the Army, and save in defense of my native State (with the sincere hope that my poor services may never be needed) I hope I may never be called upon to draw my sword.""

And the relevant section in the letter to his brother:

>  ""I am now a private citizen, and have no other ambition than to remain at home. Save in defense of my native State, I have no desire ever again to draw my sword.""

After the war, in 1866, he testified in front of a Congressional subcommittee and said essentially the same thing about his motivations:

> ""...the act of Virginia, in withdrawing herself from the United States, carried me along as a citizen of Virginia, and that her laws and her acts were binding on me.""

However, the timing of some of his words and actions allows for more critical examination of his motivations. This is perhaps best explored in the chapter ""Lee Secedes"" in the book *Lee Considered: General Robert E. Lee and Civil War History* by Alan T. Nolan.

According to Nolan, in February 1861, Lee had told fellow soldier Charles Anderson essentially the same thing as he had told the others quoted above, when both of them were in Texas, about to head back East:

> ""I think it but due to myself to say that I cannot be moved . . . from my own sense of duty. . . . My loyalty to Virginia ought to take precedence over that which is due to the Federal Government. ... If Virginia stands by the old Union, so will I. But, if she secedes (though I do not believe in secession as a constitutional right, nor that there is a sufficient cause for revolution), then I will still follow my native State with my sword, and if need be with my life.""

However, the same month, [he told](https://books.google.com/books?id=RntKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA36&dq=planting+corn) another soldier, Captain R.M. Potter:

> ""I saw General Lee (then Colonel Lee) when he took leave of his friends to depart for Washington [from Texas]...I have seldom seen a more distressed man. He said, 'When I get to Virginia I think the world will have one soldier less. I shall resign and go to planting corn.'""

This statement is more in keeping with what he'd written to his son in January, that he would ""draw my sword on none"" if a war broke out.

Notably, this was still months before Virginia seceded. They had convened their Secession Convention on February 3, but early news coming out of it was that the state would not secede. In early April, the convention voted against secession, only reversing course after Fort Sumter. North Carolina and Tennessee, also in the Upper South, had held public votes to convene Secession Conventions, and both votes failed.

Nolan also points to a series of letters throughout the Secession Winter, dating at least as early as December 1860, in which Lee expressed views of a South vs. North mentality, in which he was already siding with the South. The January 23, 1861, letter to his son is one of them:

> ""The South, in my opinion, has been aggrieved by the acts of the North, as you say. I feel the aggression, and am willing to take every proper step for redress. It is the principle I contend for, not individual or private benefit. As an American citizen, I take great pride in my country, her prosperity and institutions, and would defend any State if her rights were invaded...[A] Union that can only be maintained by swords and bayonets, and in which strife and civil war are to take the place of brotherly love and kindness, has no charm for me.""

In that last line, Lee makes clear that he believes a Union preserved through war was not a Union he had interest in fighting for.

After the war, in an 1868 letter to Gov. Reverdy Johnson of Maryland, Robert E. Lee wrote of his meeting with Francis Preston Blair, which took place on April 14, 1861. This is the meeting in which Lee was allegedly offered a commanding role in the U.S. Army. According to Lee's own account, he told Blair:

>  ""...stating as candidly and courteously as I could, that, though opposed to secession and deprecating war, I could take no part in an invasion of the Southern States.""

Taken together, according to Nolan, it seems that Lee's position evolved a bit in the lead-up to his resignation. Lee already was identifying with the Southern cause, and though earlier on, he expressed some sentiment that he would do whatever Virginia did no matter what—including fighting for the U.S. Army should Virginia join the war on the Union side—by April 1861, he decided he would not take part in any military role against the South, *even if his home state of Virginia did*. Lee would fight for Virginia if Virginia fought on the side of the Confederates. Had they fought on the side of the Union, it is less clear what he would have done, but there is reason to believe he would have resigned anyway and not fought on either side.

Nolan also notes that Lee's account in several of these communications gives at least one factual inconsistency. In the letter to his sister, to his brother, and to Winfield Scott, he says he has resigned, and plans to remain a private citizen, but qualifies this with the statement ""save in defense of my native State"". In these April 20 letters, he made it sound like he had no idea what Virginia's decision would be. Yet, the Virginia Secession Convention had ratified secession on April 17, with the news announced publicly the following day. On April 19, it was front page news throughout Virginia. Lee already knew what Virginia was going to do, so his ""save in defense"" statements were disingenuous. The letters' recipients would have known this at the time. 

Further, while acknowledging there is no documentary evidence, Nolan makes the case that Lee was probably already in communication with pro-secession Virginia politicians about a possible role in the Confederate armed forces at the time of his resignation. The rapidity was rather stunning, given the era: Lee resigned on April 20, which was not public; on the same day, he received ""a message from the commissioner for Virginia"" about coming to Richmond to talk about a military role for the South; on April 21, this invitation was made formally; on April 22, less than 48 hours after having resigned from the U.S. Army, he was in Richmond, accepting the Confederacy's offer of a military commission. Thus, any sort of claim he was making that he intended to remain a private citizen was unlikely to be true at the time he resigned. He knew that wouldn't be the case.

A couple of further criticisms of his stance can be made. In his letter to his sister, he wrote that he could not ""raise my hand against my relative, my children, my home"". Yet, his sister Anne (Lee) Marshall, and her husband William Louis Marshall, were committed Unionists. Robert E. Lee knew this at the time he wrote the letter. He knew what their reaction would be. In fact, his sister cut off all communication with him after receiving the letter, and they never spoke again (Anne died midway through the war). Lee writes in the letter after giving his justification for resigning: ""I know you will blame me, but you must think as kindly as you can, and believe that I have endeavored to do what I thought right."" So this claim that he could not raise a hand against a relative was at least suspect, if not outright insincere. For any Virginian at the time, siding militarily with *either* side was likely to result in taking up arms against relatives who fought for the other side. And this is exactly what happened. Anne's son, Robert's nephew, Louis Henry Marshall enlisted on the Union side, so in a very real way, Robert E. Lee ""raised his hand against his relative"". He had other Virginia relatives as well who fought on the side of the Union, notably his cousin and childhood playmate Samuel Phillips Lee, a U.S. Naval officer who famously wrote in response to Robert's defection: ""When I find the word Virginia in my commission I will join the Confederacy.""

"This is a great answer and I'm glad you chimed in! I'm just going to mention (since i forgot to in my answer) that when I watch the Emperor's New Groove, I always end up thinking of Yzma's position in the empire as a kind of primary advisor, akin to what Villac Umu was. Villac Umu (for those who don't know) was a sort of right-hand man to Incas in the latter days of the empire and in the early days of Spanish intervention. He helped advise Manqo Inca during the civil war, and even commanded troops - yet his power was ultimately derived from spiritual forces, like a holy vizier or something. Just a thought."

"Dionysius Exiguus came up with the modern world's most-used system for numbering years (Anno Domini, sometimes rebranded Common Era) in the early sixth century. For hundreds of years, however, the few Europeans dating documents preferred to continue the traditional system of dating by regnal year. By the high Middle Ages, chroniclers like Herman of Reichanau are numbering their entries by A.D. year, but we're still not quite at the point where they're common usage in charters or in people's minds. (Court testimony from even the late Middle Ages sometimes has people figure dates from either kings' regnal year or with reference to more local events). Just to make things even more interesting, Hebrew calendar years are *also* a creation of the High Middle Ages.

And yet, in these 4-5 centuries of only scattershot use of the A.D. system, there are isolated instances of writers who *do* pick it up and run with it. Bede in 7th-8th century England is perhaps the most famous. How did they do it? Easter!

The Christian liturgical calendar(s) involves some feasts that are fixed to a date and others that are more fluid. Most importantly and controversially, Easter, the history (and present, see: Catholic versus Orthodox) of whose dating is a giant mess. The early Church decided on a date for Easter that *relates to* the vernal equinox. 

But here's the thing. As you know, and as ancient people knew, years are not actually 365 days. Hence the introduction of leap years. And the presence of leap years (in the Julian calendar, which has too many leap years and so would be a problem by the sixteenth century) combined with the decision that Easter must always be a Sunday meant that the date of Easter had to be *calculated*. Indeed, this *computus* was a crucial duty of the early medieval clergy. They made table after table that calculated and listed the dates of Easter for centuries to come. So even across centuries of sporadic *functional* use of AD/CE, the medieval Church placed an absolutely premium on keeping track of the advancement of years in terms fixed to the date once presumed to be either the conception or birth of Christ.

There are some conspiracy theories floating around about ""phantom time"" that jump off from just that lack of consistent *functional* use of AD dating in Western Christian sources. These fall apart on a couple of grounds. First, the Hijri or Islamic calendar was in use from the mid-7th century, and we can compare its advancement of years to the European. Should one posit a *transnational* conspiracy to erase or add centuries, let the stars be your guide. It is possible to date significant astronomical events, such as things retro-identified as comets with known visiting patterns or eclipses. The dating of these phenomena in ancient and medieval sources line up with what we would calculate if today were 2016 AD/CE--which it is."
">General Tso's chicken is a perfect example of such a dish: it uses sugar (not Chinese), chile powder (either chile arbol or cayenne pepper, neither Chinese), and deep-fried chicken leg meat (not a Chinese cooking method) to create a dish that was massively popular when and where it was invented: in a Chinese-owned restaurant in New York City in the late 1970s. The only thing those ingredients have in common is that they're cheap to buy in bulk.

This isn't to say that these dishes didn't have local influences - sweet and sour chicken is virtually identical to a dish called 里脊肉 served with potatoes, common in the Fujian area, while General Tso's and Sesame Chicken are spicy variations of 糖醋肉 from Zhejiang. Granted, I might have it backward and these dishes originated from the Chinese diaspora abroad and became local dishes only in the last couple decades, but ""American Chinese food"" isn't completely separate from Chinese cuisine as some (not you) suggest.

"Jack Kennedy (most biographers say Jack, so let's go with that) was a major supporter of community mental health initiatives, but it was not because of Rosemary Kennedy's experience in state institutions.

Until the horrific results of the lobotomy at age 21, she had been raised at home in the U.S. and abroad by her family, instructed by private tutors when she could no longer keep up in school. After the surgery, her father sequestered her at a convent in Wisconsin called St. Coletta's. According to letters they wrote, both Joseph and, once she visited in 1961, Rose thought the care the nuns took of their daughter was exceptional.

However.

Inspired, or perhaps better *provoked* by her sister's experience, *Eunice* Kennedy embarked on a tour of both state-run and privately-owned institutions over the course of the 1950s. She later wrote:

> The conditions in
those days were terrible...there was no special
education, no physical activity and certainly no opportunity to
play sports. My visits left an indelible mark for life--I knew I
had found an area of enormous need where I could focus my
life’s work and energy.

Some of Eunice's fondest and proudest memories of her sister were always her mastery of several formal dances and her ability to play tennis, hence the emphasis in her recollection there. And that certainly shaped for *her* lifelong activism and advocacy for people with cognitive disabilities--she organized numerous sports camps and helped found the Special Olympics in 1968."

"We don't know, as no texts have been found in the Bronze Age levels at Troy. The primary evidence is personal names from Hittite treaties; we know of the kings Kukunni, Alakšandu, and Walmu from Wiluša. The first two are attested in CTH 76, a treaty between the Hittite king Muwatalli II and Alakšandu. Walmu is attested in CTH 182, the Milawata letter from a Hittite king (probably Tudḫaliya IV) to one of his vassals in western Anatolia. It's quite possible that Troy contained a mixed population of Greek and Anatolian speakers (Luwian, Proto-Lydian, Proto-Carian, etc.), which we know was the case for some contemporary cities in western Anatolia like Miletus and probably Ephesus. 

The Anatolian linguist Craig Melchert summarized the evidence in *The Luwians* (2003), page 12. 

>Contra Starke (2001 40) the adaptation of the Greek name Alexander as a *u*-stem in the name of the King of Wilusa Alaksandu is at least as compatible with Lydian as it is with Luwian. Likewise there is nothing definitively Luwian in the form of the names of the other two known kings of Wilusa, Kukkunni and Walmu (in contrast to those of other western Anatolian kingdoms - see the table in Starke 2001 37). Current evidence thus also allows for the possibility of a related, but distinct Indo-European language in Wilusa/Troy in the second millennium.

Ilya Yakubovich concurred in *Sociolinguistics of the Luvian Language*.

>At the same time one must recognize that the discussion of the ethnicity of the Trojans rests on an even shakier foundation than the debate about the ethnic constitution of the kingdom of Arzawa. In the latter case one can at least rely on a small but cohesive corpus of local personal names and on a number of texts that presumably emanate from the area. In the instance of northwestern Anatolia our resources are limited to three personal names, three theonyms, and two toponyms attested in Bronze Age cuneiform sources. Going somewhat ahead, one can observe that none of these eight elements is demonstrably Luvian or even Luvic, and most of them defy linguistic identification. The rest of the information must be supplied from the Greek poetic account of the Trojan War, whose final redaction probably postdates the historical events underlying the narrative by about five centuries. Finally, the ongoing excavations of Bronze Age Troy have failed to yield a single monumental inscription...

"The main difference between this and the argument I'm responding to is causality. The pop sci explanation for dragons and other mythological creatures as the result of finding dinosaur bones is supposing that people found bones and conjured stories of mythical creatures to explain them. The fossils worshiped as the remains of mythical heroes in Greco-Roman temples are a reverse of this - the figures already existed in their cultural memory, and when fossil bones were found they were interpreted as the remains of those figures. The same with ""dragon bones"" in China.

I'm not trying to say that it's impossible that people before the 1700s ever found fossil vertebrate remains - just that the remains they did find would be often unidentifiable as bones except in extreme cases, and would probably not be significant enough to lead to long-standing cultural mythologies."

"The thing that I find so fascinating about Cody specifically is how because he was active *during* the time itself, while not the source cause, nevertheless you can literally see the creation of the 'Wild West' mythos happening side-by-side with the *actual* West. So for people who lived through the period but weren't *there*, there often never was any other reality than that offered by 'Buffalo Bill'.  Not that it is the only example of such a forceful, contemporary myth-making, but nevertheless so interesting to compare to other cultural myths which were post-facto cultural responses to rewrite the past, not literally writing the present wrong!"
"Caesar's will stipulated that 300 sesterces (= 75 denarii) were to be given to every member of the Roman plebs. This was not every single Roman citizen, but the freeborn citizens resident in Rome - i.e., something like 250,000 people. So the sum we're talking about here is on the order of 75,000,000 sesterces.

Our sources do not talk about how the money was distributed, though we do know that young Octavian had to scramble to raise it, mostly - it seems - by selling the estates he had inherited from Caesar.^(1) He probably shook down Caesar's wealthier freedmen as well. He seems to have raised the money fairly quickly, which is hardly surprising, since handing the money out as speedily as possible was critical for his political fortunes.

So how much money, relatively speaking, was 75 million sesterces?

At the risk of blowing your minds, a lot. To judge from stray notices in Pompeii and elsewhere, Roman laborers were paid between 1 and 4 sesterces (plus lunch!) for a day's work. Most Roman craftsmen - to give a wildly generalized estimate - probably made between 500 and 1000 each year. The Roman elite, of course, had much grander incomes. Cicero, with properties worth about 13,000,000 sesterces, was probably in the middle range of senatorial wealth. The famously wealthy Crassus was worth 200,000,000.^(2)

The great generals of the Late Republic were even richer; after one of his triumphs, Pompey distributed 384,000,000 sesterces among his soldiers and officers, and then gave an additional 200,000,000 to the state.^(3) Caesar piled up equally gargantuan sums after his conquest of Gaul. We have no precise numbers, but he reportedly spent no less than 100,000,000 sesterces just buying the land for his extension of the Roman Forum.^(4)

Caesar, in short, was obscenely wealthy, though we don't know how much he worth when he died. As in the case of most wealthy Romans, his wealth was invested largely in land (Octavian, recall, had to sell Caesar's estates to raise funds). At least some of it may have been in cash - Antony, we are told, kept a large sum for himself^(5) \- and if this was so, the money was likely stored in some combination of silver denarii and gold bars.^(6)

As far as we can tell, the sudden infusion of 75 million sesterces did not cause significant inflation.  Nor did any of Augustus' other massive donations. This was only the first of several payments to the Roman plebs. As Augustus himself notes in his *Res Gestae*:

""To the Roman plebs I paid out 300 sesterces per man in accordance with the will of my father, and in my own name in my fifth consulship I gave 400 sesterces apiece from the spoils of war; a second time, moreover, in my tenth consulship I paid out of my own patrimony 400 per man by way of bounty...and in the twelfth year of my tribunician power I gave for the third time 400 sesterces to each man. These donations of mine reached a number of persons never less than two hundred and fifty thousand.""^(7)

Over the course of his long reign, in fact, Augustus distributed or paid indirectly (via shows, building programs, etc.) no less than 2,400,000,000 sesterces (or so he says in the *Res Gestae*). None of this, as far as we can tell, seriously unsettled the currency. The donations were, after all, something like a very large stimulus check, and were limited to a relatively small and privileged population.

"In the classical world, at least, it was not. There are two basic prerequisites for a quarantine policy: a basic understanding of contagion, and civic or regional governments willing and able to shut down the lifeblood of trade. The Greeks and Romans had only a vague sense of the first, and wholly lacked the second. 

There was always something supernatural about epidemics. Greek literature, famously, begins with Apollo showering arrows of pestilence on the Greeks at Troy; and well over a millennium later, Procopius could describe the Plague of Justinian in these terms:

""Apparitions of supernatural beings in human guise of every description were seen by many persons, and those who encountered them thought that they were struck by the man they had met in this or that part of the body, as it happened, and immediately upon seeing this apparition they were seized also by the disease."" (*History of the Wars*, 2.22)

The idea that plagues reflected divine displeasure was complemented, but never fully displaced, by the ""miasma"" theory of infection, first associated with the School of Hippocrates.  This explained pestilence as a product of tiny particles (sometimes called ""seeds"") emanating from the stars, swamps, or corpses. These particles, if inhaled, were thought to cause pestilence. The terrible Antonine Plague, for example, was said to have arisen when:

""a pestilential vapor arose in a temple of Apollo from a golden casket which a soldier had accidentally cut open...spread thence over Parthia and the whole world"" (SHA, *Verus* 8.2)

Though unclear on how plagues spread, the Greeks and Romans were acutely aware that proximity to a sick person increased one's chances of contracting disease. This is clear as early as Thucydides' famous description of the Plague of Athens, which notes that doctors tended to die first since they were close to the sick (2.47.4) and that people were afraid to visit houses the plague had touched (2.51.5).

But the sense that plagues were (somehow) contagious was not matched by the ability or will to impose an official quarantine. Although city governments in the classical world were strong, they seem to have regarded plagues as an inevitability, or at least as a lesser evil than the privation and shortages that would follow a shutdown of trade. The wealthiest citizens sometimes fled to escape sickness (the great Roman doctor Galen for example, left Rome when the Antonine Plague arrived, and the emperors themselves did the same a few years later when the plague struck a detachment of troops in Aquilea). But official restrictions on movement were, to the best of my knowledge, never imposed."
"Thank you very much for a very insightful answer, I can now basically understand what ""the flu"" is and I'm an idiot."
">You can see, too, how postal systems gradually evolved out of this type of setup. The ruler (or in Europe, the pope was an early adopter) would pay particular inns or stablemasters to always have horses ready for official messengers, who would work out ways to balance horses with the ""postmasters"" at the next stages.

Is this the part where we hear about the origins of “riding post” and “post-haste” and so on?"
"Keeping informed is hard! I look at every assignment that comes home, read through textbooks, and ask my kids questions about what they're learning. I pay extra attention to anything ""controversial"" like Native history or Martin Luther King Day or the presidents of the US or Columbus, etc. It really is just a ton of work to keep up with and that sucks and I don't always have time to keep on top of it but I do usually have time to catch up and really just as long as the conversations are regularly happening you'll catch enough stuff to make a difference. And since you're doing the regular conversation thing they'll learn to be skeptical and question things and research stuff on their own which is ultimately the goal. Just remember nobody is perfect and it's ok to not catch every single thing, whatever you're able to do is going to make a difference and that's what matters!"
"To be sure, there's always more that can be said about Eisenhower, how people reacted to him, and his family's immigration story (every white American family has one) but OPs question was about the public perception of a Germanic (or Germanic-sounding) surname. Part of understanding that particular history is tied up with how German immigrants and German Americans had been treated."
"This question runs up against the 20 year rule, not because this started happening 20 years ago but because it's still on-going.  The characterization is multi-faceted, but I'd argue that it it stems from the partisan divide over Unions.  

Unions have historically seen corporations as antagonists (see the [Battle of Blair Mountain](https://smile.amazon.com/Battle-Blair-Mountain-Americas-Uprising/dp/0813340969) and other union-busting activities in which companies used [private and/or state-sponsored violence](https://smile.amazon.com/Pinkerton-Agency-Americas-Detective-Organization/dp/1795341351/138-5570026-3804849?content-id=amzn1.sym.f20cd814-1d01-49fb-93a8-83020525ea50&psc=1) against Union organizers) and they've also [historically been deeply connected with Democratic politics](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7591/9781501721175/html) especially since the New Deal.

Taken together, this sets up the two major parties in the United States as ideologically divided over the question of ""can we trust corporations to do the right thing,"" first with regard to worker protections and then, eventually, everything else.  Democrats, dependent on Unions for political organization, will say no.  Republicans, dependent on corporations for the same, will say ""yes.""

So the question then becomes less ""when did it become normal to characterize REPUBLICANS as evil"" and more about ""when did it become normal to characterize CORPORATIONS as evil."" 

For that we can turn to some more contemporaneous sources. This is what I mean about the 20 year rule.  Since this question is fundamentally historical, any primary source answering it is likely to observe the 20 year rule itself, so to keep within the rule ourselves, we'd be looking for a 20-year-old source discussing pop-culture from 20 years before it was published. I'm sure they're out there but I'd argue it's not necessary in this case.  

[This article from the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/evil-corporation-trope/479295/) only briefly touches on the ""beginning"" of the trend of ""corporations are evil"", but it does document a shift from government-centric-dystopian-fiction towards corporation-centric-dystopian-fiction.  Not surprisingly, this begins to take hold as the memory of the government's near total control of daily life fades following the close of World War Two.  Post war America is one in which private companies rise in importance relative to government and, with that rise comes a change in the tone of fiction which worries about what life might be like under a corporate boot-heal. 

By the 1980s this is so well established that films like Robocop aren't even pretending to avoid comparisons to their contemporaneous political environment. Rapacious, amoral, profit driven corporations are shown pillaging public goods (like law enforcement) regardless of the human suffering caused.  These fictional representations of Republican politics land, in large part, because the GOP is, by this point, committed to Reagan's message of ""[government is the problem](https://www.reaganfoundation.org/ronald-reagan/reagan-quotes-speeches/inaugural-address-2/)"" and expressly endorses a political position in which there are very few regulations on what business can do.

This plays out in ways which cast Republicans as almost cartoon-like villains in several instances, most notably with respect to the tobacco industry.  [Today the tobacco lobby gives almost exclusively to Republicans](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=A02&cycle=2020) but in 1990 (which is as far back as I can pull data from OpenSecrets) [both sides took money... though the GOP did take slightly more](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=A02&cycle=1990).  It wasn't [until the late 1990s that the GOP felt that the political risks of taking money from Tobacco companies outweighed the benefits](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1998-04-01-9804010180-story.html) by which point about [9 in 10 people understood tobacco to be harmful.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/3553/nine-ten-americans-view-smoking-harmful.aspx)  

By this point we're a little ahead of the 1994 target date but the broad outlines are still important: the GOP's anti-regulation position put it in a position of fighting for causes that many Americans saw as overtly harmful especially from about 1980 onward."

"Depending on one’s historiographical perspective, one could argue that this is a facet in many, if not all, revolutions. What varies is simply how extreme it becomes. 

The 18th century American founders rejected one power seen as oppressive and used many of the same strategies so oppress their own Black population. The founders themselves were aware of this contradiction. 

I’d argue that similar things could be said of the Red Revolution and the Khmer Rouge, both organizations that murdered the people they claimed to be and represent themselves, after they took power, but I’m by no means an expert on this area, so perhaps someone else could comment on that."

"I can't speak to Roman or Egyptian bread, but a recent collaborative project has been studying early medieval English bread and [sharing their results on a fantastic blog](https://earlybread.wordpress.com/). The project is a collaboration between Debby Banham (University of Cambridge) and Martha Bayless (University of Oregon), and their research is still ongoing.

They argue that most bread would have been flat bread, and likely unleavened. Think dense, heavy biscuits. Poorer households would have used bean flours, while mixtures of rye and wheat would have been the choice of people who were better off. Sometimes, oats or barley might be available (though oats were probably cultivated more for horses, and barley for beer). All these flours are low in gluten (except for wheat), and would as a consequence have been pretty dense (gluten is the protein that allows bread to build a springy, airy structure when leavened with yeast). Refined, fluffy, yeast-raised wheat bread was rarer: you have to throw away a lot of the flour when you sift it to make white bread, and that's a luxury. You also have to cook it in an oven, which takes more fuel to fire than flat bread (which can be cooked on a rock in the hearth, or a frying pan). As a consequence, the kind of bread we enjoy today would have been something of a rarity, reserved for wealthy tables or special occasions. Ordinary people would have eaten something much more dense, tough, and filling."
"I'm not sure where you are getting this? My post is very clear to specify black women, white women, and black men voters. I wanted to avoid the ""women and black people"" problem that either erases black women or forces them to assimilate to the political identity of either white women or black men rather than asserting their own.

Of course, eventually black men did gain suffrage long before women of all races, and so in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth there absolutely were places in the US where black men could vote and black women could not. (A situation further mangled by Jim Crow laws that stripped black men--and eventually, yes, black women and some white women--of their constitutional rights.)"

"Hiya, I couldn't find a *single* previous thread that addressed your questions. However, combining two of them will cover the Indian angle of the question:

* /u/QVCatullus draws on the work of Michael Krondl, *The Taste of Conquest: The Rise and Fall of the Three Great Cities of Spice*, [to show how](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/36h80o/why_did_the_introduction_of_spicy_chili_peppers/cre1tvh/) Portuguese traders, whose trading networks very literally spanned the globe in the early modern era, introduced the hot peppers of the Americas to China and India

* /u/EvanRWT [explains why](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5osb44/what_did_old_world_cuisines_that_are_today_known/dcn5nsx/) the Portuguese initially found this such a profitable trade, and why Indians in particular steered their cuisine towards the American interloper. Namely, Indian food had long been quite ""spicy"" in the same *chemical* sense as American chili peppers, and it turned out that chilis grew really nicely (easily, *affordably*) in the Indian climate."
"Focusing on the Dutch mid 17th century spice trade, the home port of the Dutch east-Indiamen ships would be Amsterdam and this trade would be preformed by the Dutch East India company called the VOC. I will describe the journey the spices take from the moment the ship passes the city of Den Helder and enters the Zuiderzee. The Zuiderzee was a bay of the North sea and at the southwestern tip of this bay the port of Amsterdam was located. Due to the shallowness of the port, the large East-Indiamen ships could only enter the harbor at high tide and were forced to wait at the artificial fortress Isle of Pampus until the hightide arrived.

After being unloaded, the company had a choice to make, they could either sell the cargo directly at the ""Koopmansbeurs"" a large centralized market building in with al large scale commodity trading was preformed in the city, or they could store the spices in one of the many warehouses and speculate on the value of the goods. This speculation on the spice price could be very lucrative, as the prices fluctuated strongly as the arrival date of the ships was uncertain and normally distributed around Juli and August. And a fleet arriving early or late could influence supply and therefore the price drastically, making it a lucrative be it very risky venture. (Thank you [SilverStar9192](https://www.reddit.com/user/SilverStar9192/) ,for clearing this up!)

After being actioned at the Koopmansbeurs, depending on the merchant he could sell the spices in his local shop, where the journey to the plate ends quickly as the spice is consumed in Amsterdam itself. If the merchant wanted he could also choose to speculate on the spice price himself or transport it to a different market to sell it at a profit.

At the time Amsterdam was the major trading hub in Europe and traders and trading company's were shipping goods from its harbor to the entirety of Europe, assuming peace between the republic and the country receiving goods. Goods going to Western Germany and the Crownlands of the Habsburg, would be traded to the city of Rotterdam and from there using the Rhine river transported to the city's on the way and sold to local merchants who sold it to the inhabitants of the city's and towns.

TLDR: From harbor to storage to speculate on the spice price, then to the merchants fair called the ""Koopmansbeurs"", were the spice was bought by merchants who further transported the goods to European tows were they were sold to the local shopkeepers. These shopkeepers would sell the spices to their wealthy costumers who would use the spice, to spice up their food (Pun intended).

"The examples you point to are (presumably based on their quality and regularity, provability is hard in specific cases here) signs made by professional letterers and signmakers — an industry that was much more common and pervasive in the 30s, 40s, and 50s than today. Large and well-organized protests in this time period would employ or acquire via professional volunteers signage like the ones you use as examples. (A modern equivalent might be having a WordPress website set up for your protest: It's a common professional skill and not as expensive or difficult to acquire as you might think.) 

(If your question is more of a technical one: These signs weren't all individually hand-lettered. A professional lettering artist makes one copy, then the artwork is photographed and turned into a plate for silkscreening or lithography.)

Signage was seen as part of branding a cause, and this professional approach intersected well with the Madison-Avenue advertising culture of the day. In addition to hand-lettered signage like your examples, there are famous examples of professionally printed protest signs such as the ""[I Am a Man](https://imgur.com/a/rWdF0)"" signs (from a Memphis custodian protest) and [Malcolm X rallies](https://imgur.com/mpKcR7p) around various causes. Don't underestimate the resources available to well-organized events.

Starting in the 60s-70s and the counter-culture movement in America, signage even at larger events become much more home-grown and improvised. You'll see a lot more free expression in anti-Vietnam [protest signs in the 70s](https://imgur.com/a/iNzdi), for example — and again, this reflects a shift in the culture of expression of the times.

Of course, there has always been a range of home-grown signage alongside professionally-produced signage, these patterns are only generalizations. You can certainly see [home-grown signage from mid-century](https://imgur.com/a/ajwdk) and [professionally produced signs today](https://imgur.com/a/cpbiU).

Lastly, your question might actually just be one of aesthetics: There's little technical difference between how the signs in your example were produced and how BLM or Westboro Baptist Church signs are made. You may just personally think the lettering is nicer looking when it was done by hand, before computers. And I'd agree with you.  

Also: Protest art is a whole field of graphic design history and collection. For more, check out [The Art of Protest](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780816637713) by T.V. Reed.

"Great answer, I really enjoyed reading it. I would have one follow-up question: Anderson mentioned the Habsburgs and the Bourbons. It's very obvious why house Habsburg wasn't really viable as a ""national"" dynasty, at least outside of Austria in Germany or Spain, but what about the Bourbons? Is it because the revolution, which was quite nationalistic was based around democratic ideas?"
"One of the biggest reviews of this issue was the 2000 Florida Ballots Project

https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36207

https://www.norc.org/Research/Projects/Pages/the-florida-ballots-project.aspx

Basically, the questions they asked was ""if the same standard was applied to every ballot in Florida (eg, ignore hanging chads vs include hanging chads, etc), what would the outcome have been?""

Answer: By virtually any universal counting metric, Gore would have won

> Based on the NORC review, the media group concluded that if the disputes over the validity of all the ballots in question had been consistently resolved and any uniform standard applied, the electoral result would have been reversed and Gore would have won by 60 to 171 votes (with, for each punch ballot, at least two of the three ballot reviewers' codes being in agreement). The standards that were chosen for the NORC study ranged from a ""most restrictive"" standard (accepts only so-called perfect ballots that machines somehow missed and did not count, or ballots with unambiguous expressions of voter intent) to a ""most inclusive"" standard (applies a uniform standard of ""dimple or better"" on punch marks and ""all affirmative marks"" on optical scan ballots).[4]
> 
> An analysis of the NORC data by University of Pennsylvania researcher Steven F. Freeman and journalist Joel Bleifuss concluded that, no matter what standard is used, after a recount of all uncounted votes, Gore would have been the victor."

"The MO diaries were a non-institutionally-affiliated project started by two social investigators a few years before the war, and after the Munich Agreement [Sept 1938 annexation of the Sudetenland + appeasement] the British government decided that they cared enough about keeping an eye on public opinion that they provided funding. The program expanded pretty massively after that. The diaries, and corresponding background data, have mostly been digitized at [Mass Observation Online] (http://www.massobservation.amdigital.co.uk/).

The diaries are absolutely fantastic for getting a handle on lived experiences, but one caveat: something like 85% of diarists self-identified as middle class, so they can pretty much only be used for gauging middle-class sentiment and daily life."

"Would educated men just use their fluency in Greek and Latin to read the classics or whatever works of philosophy written in those languages which were then popular? The founding fathers wouldn't be chatting it up in those languages?

Did either have a significant role as a European lingua franka (of the elite) that could be used when no common first language existed?

Do many letters written among well-educated friends from this era exist?

"Hi, OP and readers,

Upon further review and reports from users, the mod team has elected to remove the major answer previously in this thread. Ultimately, it rested on the personal experience of one person and their friends, a violation of our rule about anecdotes. There is a *wealth* of research on teaching history/social studies in elementary and secondary education in the U.S.  Sources were requested out of this body of scholarship, but none were provided. If that changes (we've notified the user via PM in hopes that this will happen!), we'll review the post again in keeping with our standard practice.

It's especially important in this case because education and how-to-educate programs in the U.S. are so diverse and decentralized--one of the problems with ""fixing"" problems in history education has persistently been the reliance on one perspective at the policy level.

As a public history/outreach forum, AskHistorians is extremely invested in both the problems of history education and their proper solution. We hope you'll agree that a well-sourced, rigorous answer to this question is the best solution for all of us."
"Here's a short version in no particular order:

1. China and the Americas are WAY farther than Europe and the Americas. It's roughly an extra three thousand kilometers each way as the crow flies compared to the Columbus voyage, and more than double the distance Vikings had to go, assuming they're landing on the continental north america somewhere outside the northernmost part of Alaska, which is still a greater distance.
2. Any hypothetical Chinese voyage absolutely isn't going as the crow flies. It's far safer to try resupplying along the way and if you somehow knew every island and territory you'd probably wind up going south through all of the islands in Southeast Asia and beyond.
3. If you did do that prepared to get caught in a quagmire of geopolitics because all of those islands near to you have a king, emperor, or sultan. Some of them may not be friendly, or in a good place, and likely won't play along with your boldly going.
4. Once you've made contact assuming you don't die of a contracted disease, go native, or die fighting natives, you have to sail all the way back the same distance and deal with yet more problems, both abroad and whatever is happening domestically as you get home.

Intercontinental sailing, as it turns out, is complicated. There's a reason European sailors went all the way around Africa or overland to reach Asia for so long even though they knew the world was round and there was a big ocean on both ends.

However I would be remiss to leave out that the myth of a Chinese discovery has been gaining ground in junk history circles. In the Pacific Northwest people love to point at the occasional chinese coin dug up and fished and claim ""the truth"", but those coins are generally dated for long after Columbus and attributed to Chinese workers during the gold rush. A few people will claim access to some mythical Chinese wreck full of lost treasure, but they invariably refuse to let anyone else see it or give any kind of interview. Some people like to claim the Zuni tribe is somehow related to the Japanese people *and* Zheng He's voyage simultaneously and claim there's physical evidence they're related, as well as linguistic commonalities. But those physical characteristics are junk science like bone dents and the linguistics obviously hold no water since the Zuni language is still fairly widespread with many thousands of speakers, and none of them have ever corroborated that claim or verified it with any kind of testing.

There are some claims that an errant boat could be carried by currents from Asia and wind up in the Americas. This is something we've seen happen with sailors and life rafts from time to time, so it can't be ruled out as impossible. However, a ship in such conditions probably wouldn't be able to return home or establish a real colony lasting colony."

"> Care to clarify where this position came from? To whom was this ""obvious"" at the time and why were they ""clearly"" dominant? Was this an opinion circulated in media? Were politicians in other nations saying this? Or does it just seem obvious to us because we have the advantage of hindsight?

It was said (or at least undersigned by) the politicians of the ten nations besides Russia that agreed to back Russia's claim to the United Nations Security Council seat. None of the other post-Soviet delegations ever seriously raised the prospect that another one of them should get that seat, nor the idea that the Soviet seat should be lapsed altogether. The demographic size, economic weight, and sociocultural centrality of Russia within the Soviet Union made the Russians the only feasible successors to the Soviet seat.

Now, the technical legality of this succession is disputed as I have noted in my initial reply, and the Israeli professor Yehuda Blum, whose 1992 paper on the topic I cite directly several times, is an advocate of the position that Russia's direct succesion to the Soviet seat was in fact not legal, but even Professor Blum does not use the lack of consent from the other post-Soviet states at the time as evidence for this. Professor Rein Mullerson has pointed in his considerations on the Montreux Convention's applicability to post-Soviet and post-Yugoslav states furthermore to a backward-and-forward succession between Russia and the Soviet Union. In 1917, Soviet Russia succeeded Russia, and in 1922, the Soviet Union merged Soviet Russia with several smaller Soviet republics that the Bolsheviks had established. Nonetheless, the continuity of the USSR from the former Russian Empire (although legally a lot less formal than the inverse in 1991) was so universally culturally accepted that ""Russia"" and ""Russian"" became 'pars pro toto' designations for the USSR by the outside world throughout its entire history. Within the Soviet Union itself, views were more nuanced, but almost all secessionist nationalisms outside of Russia within the Soviet Union had clear anti-Russian dimensions, so even the Soviet Union itself had, at least in the minority realms, at least tendencies towards equivocation between the Soviet state as a whole and its Russian majority.

>At the time of the USSR's dissolution Ukraine had a third of the USSR's nuclear arsenal. 1,700 warheads. The difference between Ukraine being able to destroy the entire planet and the US being able to destroy it a dozen times over doesn't (to me at least) seem like it makes a big difference once the bombs start flying. [...]

Regardless of any of that, the Ukrainian delegation at Alma-Ata never seriously suggested that Ukraine should receive the Soviet seat at the UNSC in place of Russia, and instead backed, along with the other participants, the Russian Federation's claim to do so."
"Excellent question.

"The idea of space being composed of a ""luminiferous ether"" indeed still prevailed well into the 19th century. Though it was understood by then that space was not made up of normal matter (in large part from the experiment you mention), it was thought (even into the early 20th century) that space was made up of a material that just did not interact with normal matter. This was in part due to the fact that the nature of light was not yet understood at that time. It was thought that light waves, much like sound waves, needed some medium to travel in. 

It was not until the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 that there was major doubt cast on the existence of this material in the scientific community. In order to test the existence of the ether, the two set up a series of mirrors and a ~~laser~~ white light source in what is now called an interferometer. The setup essentially creates two paths of light that are perpendicular to each other. Since Earth is moving through space, the two posited that there should be ether flowing through their setup as the Earth moved through the ether/space. They expected to find a difference between the speed of the light on the path that was in the direction of the ""ether flow"" and the speed of the light on the path that was perpendicular to it. They found no difference between the two paths, which opened the door to the belief that the ether did not exist, a belief which was later solidified by the scientific community in the early 1900s.

This subtlety really only matters though if we are considering the definition of a vacuum in the strictist sense. The existence of a material that did not interact with normal matter was not of much concern to those who were making the first pressurized systems.

Edit: though lasers are used in modern interferometers they were certainly NOT used in 1887 as they didn't exist. Thank you u/HembraunAirginator"

"Alexander is not mentioned directly in the Bible. However, he is mentioned multiple times. u/Jordandeanbaker has enlightened us in the book of Ezekiel. A prophecy about Tyre being destroyed which was fulfilled by Alexander. However, this does not qualify as a ""mention."" Along these same lines, Zechariah ch. 9 tells of a prophecy involving Tyre, Sidon, and Damascus. Specifically to Tyre is Ze. 9:4  ""Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire"" (KJV). In fact, most of that chapter is a prophecy in which Alexander arguably fulfilled. Still, this does not qualify as a ""mention.""

In Daniel, we see Alexander through interpreting dreams. In fact, a great many powerful empires are described via strange animalesque creatures. Alexander is described a few times. Keep in mind, these are subjective to interpretation. In Daniel 2, Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream. Daniel 2:31-35 describe the statue of gold, silver, iron, bronze, and clay.

"" Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible. This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."" (Dan. 2:31-35, KJV). ""Broken to pieces"" and ""carried away,"" but the image ""filled the whole earth."" Alexander's empire filled the earth and was made of many parts, but eventually was broken to pieces and withered away.

Daniel chapter 7 reveals Alexander again, in the form of a leopard: "" After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it"" (Dan. 7:6, KJV). In the beginning of this chapter, four beasts are mentioned which are, in fact, empires. We interpret this to be Alexander because of the order in which it is mentioned and the number four. As you will see, Daniel uses this number often when describing Alexander.

Next, in Daniel chapter 8, Daniel talks about the ram and the goat. Daniel 8:2-8 describes a conflict between a ram with 2 horns (one higher than the other) and ""an he goat"" with one ""notable horn."" ""And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.""(Dan. 2:5, KJV). Alexander did come from the West and he did take the whole world. Daniel explains the creatures in 8:20-21: ""The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king."" Thus, we are to interpret the he goat as Alexander. At the end of the dream description, or at least the part that involves Alexander, the goat's horn was broken into four pieces, Dan. 8:8 (AGAIN). Dan. 8:22 explains that those four horns are the four kingdoms that rose up from the king of Grecia's empire. One thing to note here, Daniel interprets the goat as the King of Greece (Alexander III) and the horn as ""the first king"" (Phillip II).

Finally, Daniel chapter 11 mentions Alexander once more. Dan. 11:2-4 talks about three kings in Perisa and one mighty king in Grecia. But, Daniel, as he has always done, concludes with the empire being broken into four kingdoms. "" And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those. (Dan. 11:4, KJV).

I know this answer comes a bit late, but I wanted to add to the answers. Someone put up a great post about Maccabees, so I left that out. I hope this helps."
"There is still some debate as to how to classify this sound, actually. It's definitely *not* /w/ -- although /w/ is sometimes referred as a voiced labiovelar approximant, it's more often considered a labialized velar approximant. When people talk about the labiovelar /r/ of British Estuary English, they're referring to something that is essentually a voiced labiodental approximant with simultaneous velar constriction, or [ʋ] with velar constriction, which is similar but not identical to /w/ (American English speakers will likely interpret it as a slightly odd /w/ though).

But whatever we call it, Estuary speakers distinguish it from /w/ perfectly well, with ""red"" and ""wed"" being a minimal pair."
">  If somebody makes a claim that doesn't ""feel"" right, track it down.

To this I'd add, also make an effort to track it down if someone makes a claim that ""feels"" obviously right! That could be a case of a writer confirming one of your preconceived notions or biases. We're naturally skeptical of things that challenge what we believe, but tend to be too credulous of things that reinforce what we believe. Lots of things seem obvious but are more complex when you look at them.

Also, pay attention to what a given author writes about topics that you know well. I've read lots of pop history books that start out with some really interesting stuff based on anthropological research of ancient societies, but when they get to more recent history that I know better, I identify all sorts of errors and oversimplifications. If I'm identifying those errors in the stuff I do know, then there's a good chance those same errors exist in the topics you don't know well enough to fact-check."

"It's true that there's no way to quantify ""conversions through personal belief"" against ""conversions through violence"". Even if we could hypothetically access the inner worlds of every single converted Christian who ever lived, people would still disagree about where to draw that dividing line. We cannot ever totally divorce an abstract sense of ""personal belief in the quality of Christianity's teachings"" from other factors like... The quality of care (or lack thereof) for an individual from their previous religion; the force of a converted king (as you note); the helpfulness of individual Christians with things like pallative care for someone who may have been undecided before; the influence of peer and family pressures one way or the other; etc. It's hardly fair to human beings to try to divide their souls into compartmentalized parts like that anyway.

When it comes to the Americas, it is incontrovertible that Christianity has a long and bloody history of atrocities as part of its full-throated support of the colonial project. This has gone on for centuries and spans many different denominations. There are no doubt plenty of similar stories from Africa and Asia that I don't have the expertise to go into, although both of those regions of the world also have pockets with long histories of peacefully-introduced Christianity (e.g. the so-called ""Oriental Orthodox"" churches). I know much less about those areas though so I will leave that to someone else to add to if they wish.

A key difference with the Americas, though, is that Christianity had *no* presence in that hemisphere before colonization brought it. (A few Christians on the Norse voyages a thousand years ago made no contribution to Indigenous religious life whatsoever.) Since Christianity was a driving force behind the colonization of that part of the world, it would be disingenuous of a historian to try to argue that the Indigenous people all accepted Christianity because they believed it was better than they had before. The circumstances were not ones that allowed a calm, equal theological debate.

The goal in evaluating Ferguson's quote from a historical point of view is not trying to create a tally that will prove her wrong or right about the whole history of the world. It's more to situate the statement she's making in the context of the Oglala Sioux and the Pine Ridge Reservation, which has a long and very much ongoing history of Christian missionaries being tied to the economic exploitation of the people there and their lands. The definition of ""world religion"" is not agreed on, but when evaluating how Christianity's history has played out in *her half* of our globe, yes, I'd say the historical evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of her statement being correct.

It doesn't mean that there aren't Christians who decry settler colonialism - and there are, as I mentioned, millions upon millions of Indigenous and Indigenous-descended Christians in the Americas today. I'm not here to comment on whether you can be anticolonial and a Christian at the same time since that simply isn't the right of the historian to do, let alone a white historian from a settler background like me. There are definitely Indigenous people who believe that Christianity's teachings have the power to subvert dominant and oppressive regimes like settler colonialism. But from a historical point of view, yes, I would say it is accurate that when characterizing the conversion of Indigenous peoples, it is impossible to divorce the ""choice"" they made from the violence that faced them if they resisted."

"The set of rules Amish communities follow is called the Ordnung. Twice a year, changes are investigated, and a meeting is called in which arguments for and against are discussed. They take into account the things I mentioned above, boiling down to how the changes will affect their community. Then, every adult member (men and women) votes on the issue.

Since this happens so often, and each community has it's own Ordnung, it tends to vary a lot. Living simply, family first, and self sufficiency are their most basic tenets, so they could be ""universal decisions,"" but each community has their own interpretation of what that means."
"*ETA: The question was unclear to me initially, so this is an answer to a different question; see comments below for a direct response to this one*

The early Crusades offers some insightful examples concerning the short/long term strategies for using water access as a war tactic.

The *Gesta Francorum* records that in 1096, the crusaders of the aborted people's/zero Crusade happened upon a deserted castle a few days' march from Nicaea. But only very recently deserted, as they found it well-stocked with food for humans and horses alike. They flooded into the castle. But its water sources, a well and a spring, lay outside the gates. The Christians sent a party to defend the spring, of course, but when the Turks showed up they outnumbered and killed the defenders. With full control of water access, the Turks settled in for a siege. The *Gesta Francorum* evokes dramatically (and probably with due exaggeration) the desperation within the castle gates:

> So terribly did our men suffer from thirst that they cut
open the veins of their horses and donkeys and drank the blood; others lowered their belts and rags down into the cesspits and squeezed the
liquid into their mouths; and others urinated into the cupped hands of
companions and drank it up; and still others dug into the damp earth
and lying upon their backs piled up the earth upon their chests, so
parched were they from thirst.

Ultimately, the Christians are forced to surrender, and either convert to Islam or face death.

On the other hand, on the *actual* First Crusade, the governor of Jerusalem went on a major scorched-earth campaign outside his city, poisoning the wells and chopping down trees that might serve as hiding places. (In late medieval Europe, the latter practice would become the destruction, by secular fiat, of monastery and other Church buildings outside city walls.) Once again, we hear in Latin sources of the absolute desperation of the Crusaders for water as they rolled up to Jerusalem.

But the thing to remember is the siege of Jerusalem was *short*, barely over a month. This wasn't just because of the water--there was water *nearby*, it was just a very long haul. The Crusaders might have camped nearby or attempted to seize control of the wells, but they knew they didn't have time before Muslim backup armies arrived. In other words, poisoning the wells was an attempted *stalling* tactic. It ended up not quite working out."
"Fantastic read, thank you for writing this up.

Black representation in pop culture and media was something I recognized as having a much larger presence in the 90s but contextualizing it as a *lack* of such for Latinx folks really helps to put it into perspective.

Perception really is powerful; do you know if people were aware at the time of the same lack of opportunities and representation that Black communities had? Outside of Tupac's track, what was the dialogue surrounding these issues and differences?"
"This requires agreement that Pizza is indeed the ""primary"" delivery food. I'm really not sure that it is outside certain cultures and I think we'd have to frame the question in recent US history to make that premise true.

Historically we know that Roman towns would often have numerous thermopolia, places that served hot food, and there's no reason to think that food wasn't being delivered to customers from them. Indeed it would be harder to think of reasons why food *wouldn't* be delivered from them. You might say ""*Aha! Pizza!*"" at this point but unfortunately it seems that what we Moderns think of as a pizza probably wasn't something you could buy 2,000 years ago. Maybe even 200 years ago (*Mattozi 2015*).

We know that within those last 200 years the number of food deliveries has burgeoned across the world. On the Indian subcontinent the system of *dabawallahs*, fully organised since the end of the 19th century, delivery an eye-watering number of meal tins per day (*Roncaglia 2013*). We know that Korea has a history of noodle delivery dating back to the mid-1700s (*Hwang Yun-seok* *c. 1768*), something which became widespread during the 19th century (*Dae Young Kwon, 2019*)

So although we can't definitively pin the first food deliveries on the Romans we know that widespread food deliveries were happening long *long* before a pizza that we'd recognise existed (*Alcock 2006*), we know that long before Pizza delivery became common in the USA food delivery was widespread in India and Korea (and likely many more places), and we can be pretty sure that the majority of those foodstuffs weren't pizza - although Korea has embraced Western food quite robustly in the last 40 years.

All this leads to an entirely different question: what makes you think that ""*pizza had the entire delivery market locked down*""?

"Giuliani’s fight against organized crime needs to be understood in terms of his innovative use of RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 USC § 1961-1968).

In the 1950’s and 1960’s, especially when Bobby Kennedy’s Justice Department took organized crime as a public priority, the feds quickly found that they could easily arrest virtually any member of the mob they wanted, but they had enormous difficulty tying its leaders to the crimes of their underlings. See for example the Appalachian Meeting of 1957, in which some 60 bosses from various families were arrested and charged, but all their sentences for conspiracy to obstruct justice were overturned on appeal (note for later: before 1957 very few Americans believed the mafia even existed. J Edgar Hoover had even actively denied its existence, which suited the mob perfectly well). The problem was that traditional Anglo-American common law required more evidence for inchoate crimes than could be gathered, particularly in the face of the mafia’s code of silence.

Enter RICO, which passed in 1970. RICO allows prosecutors to bring charges against a member of an organization for the enumerated crimes committed by any other member of that organization. Importantly this means that bosses could now be charged for the crimes of the capos and soldiers. Throughout the 1980’s it was used very effectively to prosecute the mid and high level ranks, and did damage to the New York families. However many prosecutors remained wary of it for some time, given how new and potentially unwieldy it could be (the first RICO case came to trial in 1979, 9 years after its passage).

Thus, many high ranking bosses went untouched. But Giuliani realized that RICO’s definition of an organization could be extended. RICO defines a criminal enterprise very broadly and very extensively; it can contain factions of La Cosa Nostra, your grandmother’s bridge group, a labor union... just about any association of people, official or otherwise. Giuliani realized that the families were close enough in their cooperation with one another that they could all plausibly be tied together as one single criminal organization. The very concept of the mafia was itself an enterprise, and the bosses merely represented subdivisions of it. Most famously, eleven such leaders were tried together in the so-called “Commission Trial” (the Commission being the name of the panel of family leaders who periodically met to discuss business). Nine of the eleven were found guilty and sentenced to effective life sentences.

This was indeed a great blow, but its greatest impact on the subsequent power of the mafia was (arguably) indirect. The trial meant that RICO had finally reached its full potential (today it is perhaps the most powerful tool available to federal prosecutors). The mafia went even further underground than before, and generally abandoned any activity that would bring them unwanted attention (particularly public acts of violence). Ask any average American today if the mafia still exists and they will probably say no, or shrug at most. That is exactly the response the families want; to return to the days before the Appalachian Meeting when they were more of a scary bed-time story than a real threat. The Commission allegedly still meets, though nobody knows where or how often. From a legal perspective, Giuliani’s prosecutions are more laudable for the innovative use of RICO rather than for their impact on the mob.

Today, a variety of NYC public offices still work hard to fight the mob, albeit in a more regulatory manner. The Port Authority Police and the Waterfront Commission keep them out of the docks, the Business Integrity Commission keeps them out of waste management, and federal prosecutors still bring the occasional case (note in particular the creeping presence of corruption into the heating oil business over the last decade).

"Tolkien was a medievalist, so not surprisingly, he drew heavily from period primary sources. These, in turn, drew on actual folk traditions, although one must use a great deal of caution to see them as accurately capturing contemporary folklore. 

One of the more important deviations that Tolkien imposed on the world of his creation was the idea of good and evil, which was largely absent from Northern European folk tradition. The dichotomy was a Church-based importation, and the folk were not quick to embrace it. Tolkien, perhaps because he was a committed Catholic but perhaps also for the facility of his concept of plot and literature, embraced the good-versus-evil approach to his world, and this required some ""tweaking"" of the legendary traditions that served as his inspiration.

Although Icelandic sources include an odd reference to light and dark elves, there is no clear manifestation of such a concept in pre-modern Scandinavian, Icelandic, or British and Irish tradition. Nevertheless, Tolkien - drawing on this or simply setting off on his own - created a dichotomy where his elves were good and their counterpart, the orcs, played the role that one might imagine could have been assumed by ""dark elves."" In reality, folk traditions regarded all supernatural beings a dangerous even though most were neither good nor evil. They were to be treated with caution and respect, and they were to be avoided if at all possible.

Tolkien's dwarves are more at home in medieval primary literature than they are in pre-modern folk tradition. There are entities that seem to fall into that line (living within mountains, focusing on smithing, and various other attributes), but with dwarves we see the clearest, exclusive use of medieval sources."

Oops, I missed part of the question, sorry, /u/domocke. I definitely recommend reading **Dan Hobbins' translation ""The Trial of Joan of Arc.""** Hobbins does a great job in the introduction talking about how and why we can take the text seriously as a record of the trial, and Joan's own voice (and occasional sass!) comes through really, really strongly.

"Looks like I am a little late to the party, however, I just answered a very similar question a few days ago, so [I will copy and paste it here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4obrjg/why_would_thomas_jefferson_write_in_and_founding/)

Specific question I answered: ""Why would Thomas Jefferson write in, and founding fathers put their signatures on, the 2nd amendment after Shays rebellion?""

This is an incredible question and I'm very glad you asked.  Before I answer it, I'd like to briefly describe what Shay's Rebellion actually was:

**Context:** 

Shays' Rebellion was an armed uprising led by former Massachusetts Militiamen and Veterans of the American Revolution which took place between 1786 - 1787.  Daniel Shays led several thousand ""rebels"" to fight against the economic injustices that were facing farmers and agrarian peasants all across America.  These farmers were experiencing extreme poverty following the end of the Revolutionary War.  All across Massachusetts (and the rest of America) farmers saw their lands foreclosed on in unfair property seizers, and they wanted to fight back, which they did here.  They were also trying to fight taxes which were beginning to be levied against them.  They fought this in many ways, but among them was closing and obscuring roads so that government agents couldn't reach rural parts of the state.  Shays' Rebellion would ultimately be put down, but it startled the gentry who feared further uprisings throughout the United States. 

I also like to point out that the naming of this event is really interesting.  The people who did this, called themselves Regulators ( [modeling off of the North Carolina Regulators](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/542884.Breaking_Loose_Together) who also fought against economic injustices before the start of the American Revolution.).  The idea of Civilian Regulation was a popular idea that sought to end government corruption and stamp out the overwhelming power of the gentry.  They believed that if the government wasn't regulating itself on behalf of ""We the People"", then ""the People"" had the right to regulate, or take back the government -- to take it back and do what they believed was right.  They didn't see themselves as a rebellion, but rather the gentry labeled them as such in order to de-legitimize their cause.  The gentry didn't want to call these men ""militiamen"" or ""regulators"" for this reason (which they clearly were), but instead, branded them as ""rebels"" who needed to be stopped.  

Veterans like Benjamin Lincoln would raise militias on their own and mounted their own assaults against the ""rebels."" They call themselves the ""the Massachusetts Militia"" even though it was the former militias who they were fighting!  So as they begin to debate this on the national stage, especially in 1787 at the Constitutional convention, the gentry singled out Daniel Shay (even though there were actually many other leaders), and they said he was crazy and people were only following a demagogue.  They hailed The Massachusetts Militia as the victors and saviors and asserted that militias are what will save America in the future against such madness.

**Answer:**

Although the Constitution was drawn up in 1787 and ratified in 1788, the Bill of Rights was not ratified until December of 1791 when the Bill of Rights was finally agreed upon.  Whether or not to include the Bill of Rights (and what to include inside it) was a matter of extreme contestation between the Founders and everything within it was deeply fought over.   

When we look at the Second Amendment specifically, we should look at a few things before hand.  First, by the 1790s, other small rebellions had popped up all over the country.  Terry Bouton's article ""A Road Closed: Rural Insurgency in Post-Independence Pennsylvania"" (The Journal of American History, Vol. 87, No. 3 (Dec., 2000), pp. 855-887) masterfully explains the fighting and rebellion that took place in the rural countrysides of Pennsylvania that mirrored what had happened in Massachusetts with Shays' Rebellion.  Simply put, the gentry were terrified that they were losing control of rural America, and as a result they would not be able to seize foreclosed land and collect taxes, which they deeply wanted.  Empowering militias to be trained and carry firearms allowed the gentry to call up these men in times of need and suppress these rebellions that were taking place.  

Now there was already precedent in existence for protecting militias and their rights to bear arms in many states. Multiple other bills of rights from other states had already protected a militia's right to bear arms (such as [Section 13](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/virginia_declaration_of_rights.html) of Virginia's Declaration of Rights) and many of these states were fighting to have the federal government protect this as well.  

Now, look at the very wording of the [Second Amendment](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html).

>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

""A well regulated Militia""  is the key phrase. They are referring to the militias led by people like Benjamin Lincoln and his Massachusetts Militia not Shays and his ""rebellion"".  The initial goal was to protect a state's right to call up arms against rebels, not to arm the masses.  The Founders feared that in some states (like Rhode Island) that were already being drastically controlled by the poor (rather than the gentry), that local governments would start being able to choose who could keep and bear arms, and that by creating the Second Amendment, the gentry would always have the ability to call up and arm militias in times of need. 

**Clarification:** I also need to stress that this question mentioned Jefferson by name, however he was not a signer of the Constitution, but did certify the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1792.

Tl;Dr: The second ammendement wasn't passed *in spite of* Shays' Rebellion, rather it was passed *because* of Shays' Rebellion.

"So again, does this mean my long-awaited answer to the question is that the roster of justifications for war has shrunk in the past seventy years? Maybe. The constructivist school of International Relations Theory would largely think so. The Constructivist School of international relations theory believes that global politics is a function on the one hand of the the ideas held by individual political actors, and on the other of factors which constrain those actors. Thus the global trend of national institutions enforcing a broad level of stakeholder enfranchisement, changes to values pacing a larger premium on peace and stability, and new technologies which makes it difficult to push public discourse in a direction where war is acceptable, have all converged to create a social and institutional climate which has discredited war as an acceptable course of action. Wars of conquest fall victim to this change in paradigm above all other things: how can a political class tasked with appeasing a multitude of increasingly complex internal stakeholders hope to find a path to redirecting resources and energy to the business of conquest? 

Constructivism, widely but not universally accepted in the world of of IR theorists, normally comes in one of two flavors: Liberal and Realist. Both of these two traditions can and have existed as stand-alone schools of thought. Each will also offer a slightly different slant on why we have not seen any recent wars of conquest, or indeed any system-changing wars, in the past seventy years. The Liberal tradition holds that since the Second World War, conflicts between states have simply become too costly. Indeed the world since the Second World War has become deeply interconnected, with goods and services exchanged at a breakneck pace across borders, and war would cause incalculable damage by jeopardizing the safe conduct of economic activity. The very exchange of economic activities regulated and indeed encouraged by a multitude of institutions to which states have willingly deferred part of their very sovereignty: the United Nations and its various agencies, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and countless minor institutions with a more restricted or specialized focus, like the Bank for International Settlements, the Inter-American Development Bank, or regional supranational institutions, like MERCOSUR or the European Union. Indeed, although even the most erudite functionary of the European Union will struggle to decide if their institution is supranational, intergovernmental, or something else entirely, what is undeniable is that the union has presided over Western and Central Europe’s longest period of peace since the Roman Empire. Supranational institutions not only offer a 

The final macro category of International Relations school which will attempt to offer a clear answer to your question is Realism. Realists perceive international politics as a function of power, and perceive peace as a result of a balance of power. A Realist Constructivist would, for example, point to the decline of the European Colonial Empires and the rise of the United States as representative of a clear paradigm shift: no longer are the strongest powers colonizers who seek to impose extractive rule on the peoples of the world, but rather a new power which believes in the principle of self-determination, and whose leadership prefers economic dominance to outright political dominance. A theorist blending realism and constructivism will look at the supranational institutions listed above and point to the fact that they are disproportionately located in one place: Washington DC, as proof that the global hegemon has constructed a world order centered on them, and does not need or want to embark on wars of conquest to exert dominance. 

A pure realist (of which there are practically none left among IR theorists, but which were historically very prominent) would eschew the usefulness of supranational/international institutions altogether, and instead argue that the balance of power is what stopped wars of conquest from erupting in the post-World War era. The well-defined spheres of the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as competition to curry favor with unaligned states which could flip to one sphere or another, in addition to the existence smaller spheres (such as that which emerged around China) is what kept world powers from embarking on wars of conquest, preferring instead proxy wars or wars to stabilize or establish client states (and while no one is a declared “Classical Realist” anymore, there is still a lot of thought expended upon what sort of “Balance of Power” is the most stable, with many postulating that the largely “Bipolar” world dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union was the most stable system, and a lot of arguing on how stable the post-1992 unipolar world truly is; Charles Doran’s work is most interesting in this regard, postulating that between 1945 and the late 90s the “Share” of world power was never sufficiently concentrated nor sufficiently fragmented to replicate the conditions for war present in previous decades and centuries).

The altogether unsatisfying conclusion is that it is impossible to definitively answer why something did not happen (or, as in this case, why something no longer happens). Even when International Relations Theorists set out to write papers and attend conferences specifically to answer questions like yours, they themselves disagree on the causes (and consequences) as we have seen above."

"Firstly thanks!

[According to The Americana Music Association](https://americanamusic.org/what-americana-music) (the people who've given all the awards to Jason Isbell I mention before), Americana is:

> contemporary music that incorporates elements of various American roots music styles, including country, roots-rock, folk, bluegrass, R&B and blues, resulting in a distinctive roots-oriented sound that lives in a world apart from the pure forms of the genres upon which it may draw. While acoustic instruments are often present and vital, Americana also often uses a full electric band.

In terms of what this actually means, ultimately genres are decided upon by groups of people, and they usually to some extent reflect what a particular demographic wants to hear. Americana is ultimately like that - there's a demographic of people who want to hear what these days is old-timey music - i.e., probably music without synthesisers, that's not just straight rock & roll - which often might be fairly country music-influenced, but which isn't going to sound like modern commercial country music, and which shares their (probably a bit middle-class/left-leaning) values in various ways that are not always surface-level.

I mentioned this a bit in the actual answer, but it's basically a genre of music that developed from people inspired by bands and artists trying a mix of country, rock, and folk in the 1960s and 1970s (from Johnny Cash to Gram Parsons to Bob Dylan), and which has been influenced by things like the 1970s outlaw country movement discussed above, the 1990s 'alt.country' movement of *No Depression* magazine, and bands like Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, Whiskeytown, etc, and the 'indie folk' of the likes of Bonnie Prince Billy or Devendra Banhart. It's generally a historically-oriented kind of genre, seeing music that was originally a sort of pop music as being 'traditional' and 'authentic' and worth examination. Often it involves music that recontextualises older folk/country styles for contemporary audiences - sometimes as a sort of ye olde country cosplay, a bit like the way that the 1960s British blues bands tried their best to sound like a black guy from Chicago in 1952. Sometimes Americana seems like a bit of a implicit inverse reaction to what's currently popular in country music - so Americana might get a bit more acoustic when popular country music gets particularly loud and rambunctious, and vice versa (e.g., there's a lot of 1980s stadium rock, almost Bon Jovi-style, in a lot of current popular country music).

Sometimes, depending on trends in country music and trends in Americana, the divide between country music and Americana can be quite thin; sometimes, the trend can be quite significant, in a never-the-twain-shall-meet. As I mentioned before, Jason Isbell's sound is obviously palatable enough to the country music crowd for them to at least nominate *The Nashville Sound* for an award, but other things within Americana would likely be too idiosyncratic/adventurous/weird to appeal to the tastes of the people who like commercial country."

"I have an answer about wolves in medieval Europe, especially England (where they went all but extinct by the end of the M.A.) that might interest you!

* [A common trope in RPGs is very aggressive fauna. as in if you come across a wolf. that wolf will fight you to the death. How concerned would a medieval traveler be of encountering aggressive wildlife?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gp7i5j/a_common_trope_in_rpgs_is_very_aggressive_fauna/frln6tc/)

So the game designers sure got one thing right: if your DM does put a wolf along your path, your medieval-esque character would be terrified.

Medieval western Europeans were so scared of wolves, specifically, that they often equated wolves and outlaws. As I've [written on AH](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ufacg/in_fantasy_literature_travelling_groups_are_often/d5pnxur/):

""While Gerard Breen points out that *many* cultures link criminals and dangerous animals, the association between wolves and wandering outlaw-criminals is particularly strong across western Europe.

The Norse sagas, for example, use dog and hound imagery to discuss exiles and avengers. But straight-up murderers and criminals might wear wolf cloaks or earn the sobriquet *Ulfr.*

In England, too, the connection between wolves and outlaws was strong--strong enough to be codified as law! An outlaw could be declared ""wolfesheed""--literally, *a wolf's head.* In the later Middle Ages, this meant that the outlaw could be hunted like a wolf, that is, with abandon and all due legality. In the pre-Norman Conquest days, when the term seems to originate, the point was that killing an outlaw and killing a wolf earned the same bounty.""

Where this equation comes into play here is the not-unjustified notion of outlaws as bandits along the roads. It's not a one-one connection, and medieval people knew that perfectly well. However, bandits were a *major* threat to travelers across the entire world. 

They're one of the reasons even the account of Ibn Battuta, the audacious and fearless 14th century Moroccan, has him easily convinced to travel across the North African coast in a caravan on his hajj. And why Christian and Jewish pilgrims to Jerusalem were willing to be exorbitant prices (to people of all religions) for accompaniment across assorted deserts.

But I've diverted from the point: fear of wild animals. Some of our richest sources for medieval travel come from the narratives of pilgrims to the Near East. Most pilgrims follow a standardized format of pretty much just listing which holy sites they visited. Others are more effusive. And we hear a lot more about *fear* of animal attacks than actual attacks.

Niccolo da Martoni, for example, has to use a standard (and rather wrong) description of the crocodile, because he never even saw one--he only heard about it. However, his description specifically notes that crocodiles attacked boats in order to eat the people. Felix Fabri was similarly unhappy about the hippopotami in the Nile. Crossing the Alps, travelers stick wild animals in with simple catalogues of the dangers they faced.

But there's a little more to our story.

Bertrandon de La Brocq́uière describes coming across a giant lizard he did not recognize...and his guides, who did recognize it, were so scared they ran away. The Europeans, SO BRAVE, dismounted their horses and it ATTACKED THEM, and one of them eventually cut its throat.

...The part of the story I didn't tell you there, however, was that when the guides fled, so did the lizard. And it tried to hide. The European pilgrims pursued it, swords already in hand. The lizard jumped at one of them in self defense *after* it had been attacked. (SO BRAVE.)

The point here is: travelers were so scared of wild animals that they talked about attacks by ones they never saw. They *added* mentions of attacks by wild animals onto standard encyclopedia (bestiary) descriptions. *They didn't even need to be attacked to be scared of wild animals.*

And then there's a wolf attack, one that actually happened and that was initiated by the wolves. It wasn't against travelers, but it certainly amped up fear of the wild animals.

In the late Middle Ages--as human settlements increased and spread out, and wilderness shrank--there were multiple accounts of wolves threatening Paris (of all places). The most notable is certainly the winter of 1438. That year, [and I am not making this up](http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&O=NUMM-102925), wolves *slid into Paris on the frozen Seine River* and attacked the prey they could find in the streets--pigs, dogs...one chronicler even says they killed a baby, although that could easily be apocryphal or actually the work of a pig.

...But why did the wolves ice-skate into Paris? Because they were starving. Not because they were the brutal beasts who were so dangerous that they were sometimes used as iconography for the devil. They were, if you will, chaotic neutral. It was a matter of survival and circumstance, not innate evil.

That's not what medieval Europeans tended to see, however. And to circle back right to the beginning, including as I've [previously written](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ufacg/in_fantasy_literature_travelling_groups_are_often/d5powzs/) on AH:

""Perhaps most interesting in the current context is a particularly fearsome wolf who became infamous enough in Paris to earn the nickname Courtaud or 'short-tail.' Courtaud appeared in the midst of a wave of wolves actually killing humans of all ages in Paris, and 'people spoke of him like they would a bandit of the forest'--an outlaw robber of the highways.""

"*EDIT: This comment deals specifically with the part of the question that says ""popular portrayals"". I cannot comment on how available was the open data to reconstruct all you wanted to know about nuclear strikes — and, importantly, how many people there were who could perform this reconstruction. This is about the popular image of atomic weapons.*

I would like to expand this a bit to a post-war overview because I think it's relevant to the question. Because actual, informative, and clear descriptions of what an atomic explosion is like, and what happens afterwards, were not freely available to people on both sides of the Iron Curtain until decades after the war. I did research on apocalyptic and postapocalyptic scenarios in public consciousness and media, and I found that this terrifying mystique was a significant part of why there was so much speculation and fear surrounding the topic.

It may sound strange — after all, what do you need to know to be afraid, except that two countries have enough nukes to destroy the world several times over? (IIRC over 20 000 warheads on Soviet side and nearly 20K on the US side at the height of nuclear scare in the 80s; ironically, USSR ramped up the production only in the late 1970s, worried about newer American missiles and reaching parity, and greatly overshot).

But people say again and again when recounting life during the Cold War, that it was the uncertainty and vagueness that made them uneasy when they tried to think about what would happen to them in case of the war. And they also say that it was the snippets of the real actual footage of atomic tests that acted as a great shock for them, that became the stuff of nightmares. Most of now-familiar bits of footage — showing how powerful the blast wave is, how searing the heat impulse, how humongous the modern bomb's cloud — were only declassified and released to the public much later, in the 1970s, and can be speculated to have played a large role in the eventual de-escalation. They sparked a number of realistic fictional depictions of atomic war in the 80s (*Threads*, *The Day After*, *Letters of the Dead Man* and others) which genuinely shocked the audiences. The brilliant recreation of these revelatory shots in Terminator 2, in 1991, still had a fresh gut-punch effect that James Cameron knew it would.

For a long time after the war, governments were completely silent on the effects of an atomic blast, apart from the fact it's a big explosion and radiation is somehow involved. They were learning themselves, after all, and all things related to nuclear weapons were tied in absolute secrecy. This information blackout is reflected in culture as the post-war vogue for ""atomic"" superheroes and super-monsters, and it is where our staple cartoon version of ""mutants"" and ""mutations"" comes from. Giant ants, giant lizards, giant everything. And later, ""melted"", tumorous, crazed human mutants. The scholarly consensus is that these are attempts at speculation and ""living through your fear"" in absence of any real information. Godzilla and kaiju films are also widely regarded as a related, although different, phenomenon.

Much later, descriptions of atomic blast's various effects (and how to protect yourself from them) were seemingly thoroughly explained to citizens in civil defense briefings and materials. But these were very dry and optimistic as safety cards tend to be, creating more anxiety still in ordinary people. They wondered if these instructions were just there to placate people; they also wondered at the seeming futility of some of the proposed techniques. It's not just the famous American ""duck and cover"" — but also [""mattress forts"" in British Protect and Survive broadcasts](https://youtu.be/7yrv505R-0U?t=825), or [""falling behind a low feature""](https://yadi.sk/i/DehA1KkvkTRGAA) and/or ""crawling/running towards shelter"" in Soviet ones, generating a lot of dark jokes I've heard since childhood *(""Soldier! In case of atomic flash, turn your back on it and hold your rifle in outstretched hands, so that molten metal does not drip on government-issue boots""; ""Citizen! In case of atomic explosion, cover your head with a newspaper and crawl slowly towards the nearest graveyard - Why slowly? - To prevent panic, of course"")*. The difference between types of bombs was also rather cryptically and sparsely explained, or difficult to understand and visualize. At the same time propaganda often accused the Enemy that they employ even ""more inhumane"" versions of nuclear bombs. Hydrogen bomb remained for decades just a word, with its actual mechanism still mostly classified today.

Scientists, mostly in the attempt to call for disarmament and warn against escalation, poured more oil onto the fire by speculating on apocalyptic repercussions of atomic war: proposing such popular theories like nuclear winter (currently heavily debated) and cracking of the tectonic plates with hypothetical super-powerful hydrogen bombs.

Worst of all, the civil defense materials never explained what happens next, for understandable reasons. In government's eyes, it was logical because civilians would be managed by appropriate authorities and would be better off staying put. In people's eyes, it looked like they were invited to simply prolong their agony. It was this incompleteness of information at first, and distrust in fullness of the information later, that in large part fed the popular fear."
"Okay, so I’m not a historian, but I do know a bit about the subject; so I can provide a semblance of an answer until someone more qualified comes along. 

One of the biggest connections between the CIA and Crack Cocaine lies in a single individual, “Freeway” Ricky Ross, a drug trafficker from LA, who sold up to $3 million worth of cocaine a day during his height, and namesake of rapper Rick Ross. Ricky Ross claims to this day to have been provided with cocaine by the CIA, but is this true?

Now one of Ross’s sources for cocaine was  Danilo Blandòn, a Nicaraguan national who was exiled after the overthrow of the Somoza regime. He moved to the States and used his resources in Nicaragua to produce cocaine which he sold in US markets. He then used the profits to support the FDN, a contra group. Contras obviously bring up images of Oliver North and the infamous Iran-Contra scandal, so at the very least the CIA was in the periphery. 

So we have the CIA, supporting a group, which is also supported by a man, who is the supplier for one of the largest drug kingpins in LA. This is where a conspiracy theorist says connect the dots, but this isn’t an episode of scandal makers, and I’m here to examine what carries water. 

First let’s examine the drug in question: crack cocaine. Which although treated and thought of differently then cocaine, essentially isn’t. Crack is a form of cocaine which is prepared to be free based, or smoked, giving it a more intense high. Think of it as oranges versus orange juice. While you can make your own orange juice from oranges it takes time and effort. In the same way the ability to smoke cocaine (without making it into crack) is there, but takes time and effort. So you can go to a corner store and buy orange juice, in the same way you can go to corner boy and buy crack. One claim brought up often in this is the CIA invented crack, which is more than likely untrue. Smoking cocaine has existed for as long as the drug, and even Sigmund Freud was know to enjoy cocaine cigars, and the practice predates the CIA, by some 60-70 years. More than lucky some ingenious drug dealer simply by seeing an untapped market, and created a product by mixing cocaine and some additives. Even Ross saw cocaine at 19 in ‘79, so it was established well before the crack epidemic of the 80s, and likely without CIA assistance. 

Okay, so then how involved was the CIA in importing the most important ingredient cocaine. So this is where it starts getting murky. The CIA certainly assisted the contras, and the contras had known cocaine ties. A congressional committee led by John Kerry found that there was:

>Involvement in narcotics trafficking by individuals associated with the Contra movement.

>Participation of narcotics traffickers in Contra supply operations through business relationships with Contra organizations.

>Provision of assistance to the Contras by narcotics traffickers, including cash, weapons, planes, pilots, air supply services and other materials, on a voluntary basis by the traffickers.

>Payments to drug traffickers by the U.S. State Department of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies.

With this we can see that the Contras were certainly involved in the cocaine trade, and US aid was going to help contra traffickers. Furthermore the Kerry Committee’s report also states:

> the CIA's Chief of the Central American Task Force went on to say: We knew that everybody around Pastora [a contra leader] was involved in cocaine ... His staff and friends (redacted) they were drug smugglers or involved in drug smuggling.

So we see, the CIA was aware of the connections between contras and cocaine and did essentially nothing. Further supporting this is a report by the CIA itself which states that 8/22/82 The CIA was aware of a drugs for arm deal, between contras and US arm dealers and did nothing to stop it. So at the very least the CIA was neglectful of the situation to the point where they did not stop such action which they knew were going on.  

As far as cold hard facts that’s all we have. The CIA was complicit, but not directly involved in the cocaine trafficking of the 1980s which led directly to the crack epidemic. There has, on the other hand, been a lot of conjecture. Ricky Ross was apprehended after a drug sting by the DEA which was organized by Blandòn, after he was captured by the DEA. Blandòn himself received a rushed permanent residency in the US. Ross asserts that he had dealings with the CIA itself, and that he was in essence set up as a fall guy. Other active drug dealers of the time also claim to have met with CIA agents. And the conspiracy goes on, but these are testimonies by people, generally jailhouse confessions, and cannot be collaborated. However, it is certain, at the very least, the CIA was passively complicit in the drug trade.

"I would say - it's complicated (surprise, surprise). The landowning gentry in Galicia were Polish speakers, and the serfs (freed after 1848) spoke a dialect that would now be called Ukrainian. The Greek Catholic Church in the region mostly used Polish, but a number of priests based in the Lviv Theological Seminary, such as Yakiv Holovatsky, Markiyan Shashkevych and Ivan Vahylevych  were instrumental in collecting Ukrainian folklore, publishing Ukrainian literature, and teaching Ukrainian language and philology. 

It gets complicated because not only were these Galician figures priests in a still-nominally Polish using Greek Catholic Church, and were generally from Polish-speaking families, but their movement was generally speaking Russophile - it looked to Russia as a Pan-Slavist protector for the development of the movement. 

So I guess I would say that the Austrian government provided some tactical support for Ukrainians in Galicia in the early 19th century, but only to a limit (it never really threatened the Polish gentry), and much of the Ukrainian National Revival figures there ultimately ran afoul of Austrian authorities for supporting a Russia-based Pan-Slavism (which wasn't the same thing as considering themselves ethnic Russians, I should clarify).

ETA if people are interested in additional reading, I would strongly recommend *The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine* by Serhii Plokhy. It's probably the best thing one can find to an up-to-date, comprehensive history of Ukraine that is also generally pretty open to historic points of view from various sides. Timothy Snyder's *Reconstruction of Nations* also has some useful parts in relation to Ukraine but Snyder's focus is on Poland so much of the history is specifically through the lens of Polish-Ukrainian relations."

"So, dandelions. First, in terms of the Great Depression, they're one of the generally disregarded products of the Columbian Exchange - there are some varieties of dandelion or closely related plants native to North America, but the ones you'd generally recognise are Old World imports. It's not clear whether they were intentionally imported or not, but given their seeding habits, the chances are good that they were accidental. They grow *anywhere*, and can be incredibly destructive plants when they push up through paving or have their roots crack through walls.

They're regarded as a food or medicinal plant through recorded history, though never as a particularly desirable one. Abū Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyyā al-Rāzī, known in the west as Rhazes, wrote about them around 900CE, but only as a medicinal plant, and Avicenna (Ibn Sina) reputedly devoted an entire chapter to them in one work a century later. As far as I can tell, though, they're not included by Al-Warraq in his cookery book in Baghdad, roughly contemporaneous with Ibn Sina (at least, I can't find any reference to them under the names I know, and the translator of the edition I have, Nawal Nasrallah, hasn't included them in the index of ingredients). They were almost certainly included in the range of green plants used by European medieval peasants in pottages, although, again, they're not actually included in any of the lists provided by Peter Brears in *Cooking and Dining in Medieval England*.

The Victorians seem to have made more use of the dandelion. E. Lewis Sturtevant, writing in 1886, notes it grown for the Boston market in 1836, and he says the seed is for sale in ""various seed catalogues of 1885"" in no less than 6 varieties. The first mention of dandelion as a vegetable he could find in England was 1846 in the Gardeners' Chronicle, where it's described as ""a beautiful and delicate blanched salad"". He also says ""[t]he influence of rich soil and protected growth upon the dandelion is to give increased size and succulence to the plant, and to thicken the branching of the leaves"", which is in line with most cultivated versions of wild plants. There was considerable interest in the Victorian era in new and exotic vegetables, much as there is now, and if they could be got by cultivating wild plants, so much the better.

However, dandelions, once grown, can be very hard to remove from a given location. The taproot - which is edible too - can go down a metre without much difficulty, and unless it's pulled out entirely, the plant will regrow from it. This is a feature if you're harvesting it, since it'll reappear within weeks, but if you're trying to clear it from a bed to make way for something else, it's a pain. This is probably one of the two reasons that it's not really grown for food anymore - the other being that it's not terribly good. Arugula, or rocket, is generally better tasting than the leaf. The flowers *can* be made into a hedgerow wine, but you generally need to add other things (lemons, for example) to get anything that tastes palatable. The root can be dried, roasted, and ground to make a drink that is claimed to be like coffee, presumably by people who have never had coffee - but actual coffee, or even chicory, is better. And so forth. By 1911, the Britannica says, somewhat delicately, ""[f]or the purposes formerly recognized taraxacum is now never used"". In addition, the difference between the cultivated and the wild dandelion isn't really enough to merit growing it deliberately.

They're not the only vegetable to disappear from modern use through inconvenience - there's one called skirrets, which resembles carrots and parsnips, but has a bunch of longer, thinner roots, which are obviously more difficult to peel and cook than their fatter cousins, so they've been left behind. Likewise, alexanders, a leafy green, is more bitter and requires more cooking than celery, its closest modern equivalent, so it's been abandoned as well. I haven't eaten skirrits (yet), but I can assure you that alexanders taste like freshly cut hedgerow smells.

They're not _completely_ absent from modern cuisine, although they always seem to come with caveats. Harold McGee notes that it's 'occasionally grown on a small scale'. They're used in a traditional English soft drink called Dandelion & Burdock, which is still made (a brand called Fentimans is the one I know). There is a claim in various articles that a local variety called 'koproradiko' or 'mari' is eaten in Crete as a salad ingredient, or boiled, but it occurs in so many places with exactly the same phrasing that I suspect it's copied from a single source, and I can't find anything to back it up. They're eaten in Greece in general, though, as one of many plants under the label 'horta', and are known there as 'radikia'. 'Horta vrasta', which seems to be literally 'boiled greens' is possibly the most authentically historical way to eat them. Blanched leaves (grown under cover) are sometimes seen in salads in vegetarian restaurants here in Ireland, too, and they're occasionally used in French cuisine.

"According to Green's Dictionary of Slang, [""bird""](https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/ys6bpva) as a euphemism for young woman or girl dates to the 1500s in England, though the first known instance in the U.S. is cited as 1845, which is the same year this passage was published.

However, I'm not sure the slang ""bird"" 100% fits here. I skipped over a bit of the passage, and if you read [the whole thing](https://books.google.com/books?id=HcRIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA203), the writer sets up a metaphor for taking a ""bird"" to a ""nest"" before that. It seems to be a euphemism specific to the passage here, rather than general slang. But that's just my assessment based on the passage. I don't have any special knowledge on the use of this bit of slang."

"Unfortunately, your question is based on an incorrect assumption.  The Spanish Flu of 1918 did not stop spreading.  It became one of the seasonal flu variants that circulated in the population[1].

The question is why did the subsequent seasons result in much fewer deaths.  The dominant hypothesis is that there was a rapid mutation to a less deadly strain after the second wave.  It is a recognized tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal over time as the deadlier strains die out, though pathogenic viruses can always mutate into a deadlier strains.  In 1952-1953 there was an influenza epidemic of the H1N1 variant that had a peculiar mortality curve, affecting the young more then the old, because the older people had some immunity due to having been exposed to the earlier 1918 variant[2].

The 1957 H2N2 pandemic, followed by the H3N2 pandemic largely crowded out the H1N1 1918 Spanish Flu from the seasonal circulation in the human population.  H1N1 variants still did circulate, but they were not the dominant strain and they were not a significant contributor to the flu seasons after 1957.  However, the 1970 swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix was an example that the Spanish Flu virus descendants were still endemic to swine and could jump back into human hosts.  This was reinforced by the 2009 swine flu pandemic, which was a re-assortment of four different H1N1 virus, and where it was noted that people born before 1950 who had exposure to the 1918 Spanish Flu virus (or its descendants) had protection from the ""new"" flu pandemic[3].  It is also an example of a less-lethal endemic virus mutating into a more deadly strain.  Since the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the seasonal trivalent inactivated flu vaccine that protects against the Swine Flu descendents also protects against the 1918 Spanish Influenza virus[4].

The normal mortality curve for flu outbreaks is usually causing higher deaths in the very young and very old.  The Spanish Flu, similar to the 1952 epidemic and to some extent the 2009 Swine pandemic had an unusual mortality curve where it affected young adults more then elderly. One theory is that the Spanish Flu caused cytokine storms which caused the higher death rates of young adults.  A 2007 study of journals of the period of time of the Spanish Flu Pandemic finds that the the flu infection was no more aggressive than other previous influenza strains.  Among the different theories on why the Spanish Flu affected young adults more is the possibility that the Spanish Flu is itself a descendent of a previous H1N1 flu that had swept through the world earlier, but was removed from the yearly circulating strains by the 1889 flu pandemic[5].

In summary, the 1918 Spanish Flu never stopped spreading.  The human population (and swine population) never achieved a herd immunity.  The strain probably evolved to be less deadly and humans have learned to live with the seasonal flu (in all its different subtypes, not just the 1918 H1N1 subtype) in a way that it ""only"" kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year [6] globally through treatment (better nursing and treatment to manage downstream effects like bacterial infection of the lungs, cytokine storms and also through development of medicines like antivirals) and prevention (better awareness and hygiene, and the massive effort each year to develop and distribute the appropriate yearly flu vaccine).

In principle this would not necessarily be inaccurate, as Tang emperors (who were the first to have diplomatic and military encounters with the Umayyads) made some use of the styling ""Kehan"" - that is, ""Khagan"" or ""Khan of Khans"". I don't know if there are any primary sources on how e.g. Sogdians referred to the Chinese Emperor in their native tongue.

>Eating all meats is a big deal to the Muslim observer. Elsewhere, he compares Chinese religious practices to Zoroastrians. This is a good remind not to take everything at face value, though. Anna Akasoy has shown that ""Zoroastrianism"" (a twisted idea thereof) was a common framework through which Muslim ethnographers sought to understand foreign religions in, for example, West Africa.

I'd be interested in seeing the comparisons.

From my reading on this there's an East-West divide - Andalusian writers used ""majus"" (Magus, from Old Persian Magush probably via Aramaic) for just about any religious group using fire in ritual (especially, ironically, cremation - an unforgivable sin in Zoroastrianism), whereas Easternmore Arabic writers did not (e.g., Ibn Fadlan doesn't refer to the Rus this way; while Andalusian writers did use it for vikings). It also appears that there were more than a few Arabic jurists and writers who had a good grasp of the essentials of Zoroastrian worship, the actual purpose of fire temples, etc. But my reading on these comparisons is limited. I don't have my books at hand at the moment or I'd give you better references to primary sources but I can get them tomorrow.

It shouldn't be forgotten that Zoroastrianism was practiced to a non-trivial extent in China, though the Tang weren't terribly fond of it. Especially if Arabic literati got information about China from Zoroastrian Sogdians, it's easy to see how that impression could have been formed."
"After her father died and her half-brother Edward became king Elizabeth went to live with her stepmother Catherine Parr (Henry VII sixth and last wife) and her new husband Thomas Seymour. Elizabeth was a young teen, and Thomas had some inappropriate interactions with her, like coming into her room in his pajamas, tickling her, romping on the bed. Not acceptable now, and not acceptable then either. While Catherine thought it was fine and even joined in a couple times, once she discovered Thomas was doing it on other occasions Elizabeth was sent away. Catherine died shortly after giving birth, so Thomas thought it was ok to start up again with contacting Elizabeth with the end game being marriage so he could be ""back in the game."" He was arrested and throw in the Tower, his charges being he was plotting to overthrow Edward and marry Elizabeth. Elizabeth was interrogated repeatedly but would admit to nothing. Some people think this treatment of her by Thomas and his subsequent execution was a main reason she never wanted to marry--that, and her father demonstrated how easy it was to get rid of unwanted wives.

It was thought (by Mary's advisors) she had a hand in Wyatt's Rebellion, a plot to overthrow Mary and put her (Liz) on the throne. She was summoned to London and interrogated, but pleaded innocence of any knowledge repeatedly. Wyatt was tortured before his execution in hope of him implicating Elizabeth; he didn't. When it became clear that Mary was going to die, her husband Philip of Spain sent the Count of Feria to interview Elizabeth. Plus all the offers/persuasion to get married. She loved to string the prospective suitor along with non-promises until he finally gave up."
"More can definitely be said, but I've written before about the development of pro-natalist policies in the USSR bracketing the war years, which is definitely relevant here, so I'll repost the older answer here.

----------

Looking at natalist policies in the Soviet Union, especially with regards to abortion, we can see a *lot* of policy being driven by concerns about the birthrate, and its rise and fall. Especially at the time of the war, there was very explicit concerns raised about the issue and policies were changed and created with the explicit goal of raising it.

In the Russian Empire, and the first few years of Bolshevik rule in Russia, abortion was illegal. But, as in most places where the procedure is illegal though, the procedure was nevertheless popular, but insanely dangerous. One observer pre-1920 noted:

>Within the past six months, among 100 to 150 young people under age 25, I have seen 15 to 20 percent of them making abortions without a doctor's help. They simply use household products: They drink bleach and other poisonous mixtures.

The decision to legalize the procedure, and make it simple to obtain, was almost entirely a practical decision. In 1920 they became legal if done by a doctor, essentially in acknowledgement that it would happen no matter what, so the state should do its best to make it safe. They were subsidized by the state, so free to the woman. In 1926, the abortion rate was 42.8 per 1000 working women, and 45.2 per 1000 'housewives' (compare to the US today, at [13.2 per 1000 women](http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/). Modern Russia continues to be very high, at [37.4 per 1000 or so](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml))

But this wasn't to remain. As noted, the change was not because abortion was seen as *good*, but that legalizing it was a necessary evil and that the state would work to eliminate the underlying economic reasons driving women to have them. As it turned out, poor women were no more likely to be using this 'service though'. If anything, it was the better off women who were getting more abortions. Even worse, the birthrate in the USSR was falling precipitously, from 42.2 per 1000 in 1928 to 31.0 in 1932, according to a government study released in 1934. Thus the law changed in 1936 when policies started to return to pushing more 'traditional' gender roles for women, and included restricting abortion again - it required a medical reason now. As before though, just because it is illegal doesn't mean women don't seek them. After 1936, ""back-alley"" abortions were on the rise, and they certainly carried additional risks with them, and penalties for obtaining one meant injured women would only be further harmed by not seeking treatment:

>Women who became infected during these procedures or who sought assistance for heavy bleeding were often interrogated at the hospital before they were treated, as the authorities attempted to learn the names of underground abortionists. Abortionists were punished with one or two years’ imprisonment if they were physicians and at least three if they were not. The woman herself received a reprimand for her first offense and a fine if caught again. 

Abortion statistics aren't readily available for this period, but my book notes that as the birth rate didn't seem to change much - rising briefly through 1937 when it reached 39.6 per 1000 but again beginning to decline until leveling out at 33.6 per 1000 in 1940, the same rate as 1936 when the law went into effect - as the laws became restrictive again, this would imply women weren't especially deterred by the law and continued to seek them at the same rate as before (see 1926 numbers), if not higher. There was no ready access to, nor education regarding, other means of birth control (Aside from abortion as birth control, by far most common being 'coitus interruptus'), so it was really the only means of family planning available to women. 

The massive population losses that occurred in the early 1940s further increased pro-natal policy planning, but with both carrots and sticks. Laws to assist so called ""war widows"" (referring not simply to women who lost husbands, but women who lost the *potential* for a husband due to the decline in the male population) both in raising their children as single mothers as well as having children in the first place.

Soviet propaganda campaigns to encourage motherhood predated the war even, but the massive calamity of course kicked it into overdrive. During the war, there was a definite decline in the birthrate due to ""general decline in the reproductive health of mothers, as reflected in the high rate of premature births"", as characterized by the People’s Commissar of Public Health G.A. Miterev, and Soviet leadership worked hard to try to turn that around, with their clear awareness that to see further decline would imperil the ability of the USSR to bounce back in the long term.

Programs and incentives to encourage motherhood existed, such as awards for bearing a certain number of children and various state assistance programs for both married single mothers, while legal penalties were either added or increased, most especially with the Family Law of 1944, which further penalized abortion and increasingly penalized divorce as well. The shortage of men also meant a very important shift, in which the Soviets worked to try and both destigmatize single-motherhood by increasing state benefits they could receive and featuring mothers of ambiguous marital status in propaganda, while also tacitly encourage even *married* men to sleep around by preventing the single mothers from suing the father for child support, and making it harder for their irate wives to divorce them. The result being that many men would have numerous affairs, and even unmarried men would often bounce from relationship to relationship.

Now as to your question, which is basically whether or not the Soviets were successful in reversing the trend during the war years? Well, not terribly. There *was* a definite boost in the fertility rate immediately after the war years, but it was rather short lived, and quickly began to decline again. Here is a table of the fertility rates of the US and USSR, which allows for a comparison of the 'Baby Boom' in America, for the period in question:

Year | USA Total Fertility | USSR Total Fertility | - | Year | USA Total Fertility | USSR Total Fertility
---|---|----|---|---|----|----|
1926| 2,909| 5,566 | - |1944| 2,567| 1,942
1927| 2,827| 5,418 | - |1945| 2,491| 1,762
1928| 2,656| 5,318 | - |1946| 2,942| 2,868
1929| 2,524| 4,985 | - |1947| 3,273| 3,232
1930| 2,508| 4,826 | - | 1948| 3,108| 3,079
1931| 2,376| 4,255 | - | 1949| 3,110| 3,007
1932| 2,288| 3,573 | - | 1950| 3,090| 2,851
1933| 2,147| 3,621 | - | 1951| 3,268| 2,914
1934| 2,204| 2,904 | - | 1952| 3,357| 2,898
1935| 2,163| 3,263 | - | 1954| 3,541| 2,974
1936| 2,119| 3,652 | - | 1955| 3,578| 2,909
1937| 2,147| 4,308 | - | 1956| 3,688| 2,899
1938| 2,199| 4,351 | - | 1957| 3,767| 2,903
1939| 2,154| 3,964 | - | 1958| 3,703| 2,940
1940| 2,301| 3,752 | - | 1959| 3,712| 2,903
1941| 2,399| 3,742 | - | 1960| 3,653| 2,940
1942| 2,628| 2,933 | - | 1961| 3,627| 2,879
1943| 2,718| 2,366 | - | 1962| 3,471| 2,755

So as you can see, they did bounce, with a sharp - and important - increase in 1946 and 1947, but certainly didn't regain pre-war levels like we see in the US, and even bigger, while they had been far higher than the US before the war, the total fertility rate is now noticeably lower (with a minor exception being, when broken into age cohorts, a higher rate in the USSR for women over 30) and stabilized much quicker within a few years of the war (stabilized being a relative term. there would be later drops). So all in all, yes, there was a brief boom that we can see, and it likely was quite important as far as the stability of Soviet population numbers go, but it wasn't as long lasting as we see in the US, puttering out somewhat quickly.

"Like a lot of countries in Asia, Nepal was going through a massive transition mostly due to outside political and economic influences. Of course the stories are not the same, but if you make a list of other countries in the area and analyze what happened, you’re going to see some consistent themes. Foreign entities will be interested in these places for labor and raw materials, for military bases, and for political support on the international stage. Countries that are run by long-standing dynastic systems send their kids all over the world for tourism and education, and they come back with pretty different ideas about what a nation could look like. And for everyday individuals, media begins to flood in having a huge influence on personal politics.

For Nepal, most significant is the 1990 revolution, which continued in a cycle of chaos until a Maoist uprising that started getting traction in 1996. We do know that this was being organized long before. Certainly news of Tiananmen Square in 1989 had made it over to Nepal for example. The activists were mostly rural, but there already been a variety of protests and actions before the massacre. Clearly the communist element is directly at odds with the monarchy, especially traditionalists that think kings should have absolute control.

And then you have a third element, all of these foreign actors, such as embassies and corporations, most of which are pushing for greater democracy and transparency.

So what happens after the massacre? In many respects, it’s simply adding fuel to the fire: creating more strife between people loyal to tradition and those pushing for the new social order of communism. 

At this point we’re pushing into the 20 year rule for the subreddit, so I won’t say too much more of what happens. The new king did use his power to dismiss the parliament, and you can guess how that went over. Other than to state that Nepal is considered by many to be a country of perpetual revolution, and these events are a great illustration of that phenomenon. 

A lot of the actors involved in the story are still alive, so it’s possible that we will get more information in the years ahead. But for now it’s a great mystery and there are a lot of theories. As to whether it mattered in the long run, well, we just don’t know.

"Hi! Not to be too much of a nitpick, but there is a considerable amount of research into the topic in Spanish and Portuguese. There is far more than just two research articles to be found and in particularly in regards to Barbara Potthast whose work is amongst the most detailed and scholarly. See, for example, her full-length book *""Paraíso de Mahoma"" ,o, "" País de las mujeres""?: el rol de la familia en la sociedad paraguaya del siglo XIX* (1996) on the topic of social history as well as *Hogares dirigidos por mujeres e hijos naturales: Familia y estructuras domésticas en el Paraguay del siglo XIX* in *Formas familiares, procesos históricos y cambio social en América Latina*, ed. Ricardo Cicerchia (1998) [which I based this answer on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7r1uid/is_there_any_information_on_dating_in_paraguay/) These are only two examples of her very impressive work on the social history of Paraguayan women (and children) in the 19th century.

"For Virginia (and the wider antebellum south), part of the reason is [its river system](http://www.virginiaplaces.org/watersheds/graphics/variversusgs.png). Multiple navigable rivers stretch into the state's interior - the Potomac, Rappahanock, James, York, and others. This allowed for multiple ways for farmers and planters to transport their goods - they could ship their produce down a local river, and be processed at a relatively small town like Yorktown on the aptly named York River. Or, a merchant ship could sail right up to their own dock to load up on tobacco. This meant that Virginia never really developed the market hub where all the state's produce had to congregate to be shipped, concentrating population and capital in one place

Compare that to the great cities of the East Coast at the time - Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York. Philadelphia is at the intersection of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, and canals and roads connected it to the Susquehanna. That meant that if you were a farmer or craftsman in most parts of PA, to sell your goods in bulk it had to go to Philadelphia. The same goes for New York and the Hudson River - if I'm a farmer near Albany, the only place for me to sell is New York City. For Baltimore, the city made a major investment in railroads, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was the main artery connecting the East Coast to the midwest. That meant that if I'm a farmer in Ohio, I have two options: Ship my grain down the Mississippi (to the major city of New Orleans), or send it by rail to Baltimore

But in Virginia, there's not one city that requires that. Farmers from the north of the state can ship their produce along the Potomac to Alexandria. Those in the north-east, the Rappahanock to Fredericksburg. Farmers in the center could ship down the York to Yorktown, or the James to Richmond (incidentally, the James reaches pretty far inland, but there are waterfalls blocking the middle. Guess where Richmond is located? Right around those waterfalls, where boats need to be unloaded, portaged over the falls, and reloaded). So while Virginia might be the 5th largest state in the US in 1860, there isn't a single hub that population needs to sell to. You can see the same thing with Ohio, where the state's division between the Great Lakes and Ohio River results in multiple big cities, but nothing dominating. Compared to Illinois, where railroads, rivers, and the Great Lakes combined to drive goods and money to a single point - Chicago - which dominates the state to this day

It's no accident that the largest city in the Confederacy, without a doubt, was New Orleans. Because New Orleans was the only entrepot city that could compare to New York or Philadelphia - all the goods and crops produced anywhere in the American interior would eventually need to travel to New Orleans to be shipped internationally"

"I am going to point out that the premise of your question - that the AMA acts like a cartel and limits the number of medical schools and medical school positions - is inaccurate, and thus your question is unanswerable in it's current form.

I will attempt to provide you with background information on this matter as a non-US physician, who has an interest in medical history. Note, however, that my response here leaves the date range that could be considered historical in nature, and deals with active and ongoing current events.

Your use of the word cartel to describe the AMA suggests that you are reading some of the economic publications that were done on this topic in the 1940s to 1960s (ex: Kesel or Friedman), as I believe this is where the specific idea of referring to the AMA as a cartel began. Alternatively, you have read some other secondary or tertiary references that are influenced by this work.

You should be aware that these works were largely theoretical in nature, and not based on specific objective documented actions or policies of the AMA.

That being said, there was certainly the potential for a conflict of interest, given that the AMA was heavily involved in the LMCE, which is the licencing body for medical school (ex: this article from 1977 - https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/05/21/review-of-authority-on-medical-schools-accreditation-urged/49c54760-f656-4d68-8937-e0984593116f/?noredirect=on).

While it is certainly possible that the AMA exerted influence to artificially limit training positions in the 1970s and earlier, the problem is the lack of objective evidence that this occured.

One point that has been used to support the existence of artificial limitation of medical school training positions (by ""someone"") was the high ratio of applicants to positions - some economists suggested that the presence of more applicants than training positions was evidence of artificial limitation of training positions.

More recent publications on health economics (ex: Handbook of Health Economics, 2011) however, point out that the high ratio of applicants to medical school positions is actually due to the cost of medical education being extremely subsidized, even in the US. 

In the US, tuition fees make up only 3-4% of medical school revenues. This is because tuition costs are set below market value, in part to help encourage more applicants to apply and to avoid artificially restricting entry into the profession based solely on wealth. Was tuition to not be subsidized, the costs of tuition would be >10x higher than the $45,000/yr average it currently is, decreasing the number of applicants due to cost, and making the ratio of applicants to training positions closer to 1:1. 

There were certainly documented efforts by the AMA to at least not significantly increase the number of physician training positions in the 1990s. However this was based off of research and economic modelling that suggested there was expected to be an over-supply of physicians in the near future (ex: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/378581). Consider that given medical education is subsidized by things like government revenue, and hospital earnings, having *too many* medical school training positions would be expected to be a waste of both government and hospital money, and thus be harmful.

However, by the 2000s, it was realized that this prediction was inaccurate, and there would be a physician shortage. By 2006, the AAMC (who along with AMA are heavily involved in the LCME) was advocating for a 30% increase in training positions by 2015 (https://www.aamc.org/media/10006/download), which was supported by the AMA. 

Finally, the rate-limited step in physician training is not medical school positions, but residency training positions. Residency training positions are largely funded by the federal government (https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/more-medical-students-than-ever-but-more-residency-slots-needed-to-solve-physician) with the funding having been capped by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Legislation to increase federal funding (and thus the number of residency positions) was tabled in 2019 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/348) but essentially no progress has been made. 

It should be noted that the AMA has been spending a significant amount of money to lobby the government to pass this piece of legislation (https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-fund-graduate-medical-education-address-physician-shortages) - ie: the AMA is spending money to increase the number of physician training positions.

**In summary:** The AMA's indirect ability to potentially limit medical school training positions has drawn criticism and concerns over COI dating back over 60 years. While it is possible it took advantage of this historically, there is no objective evidence to support this. In addition, for the past 15 years, the AMA has actively supported increasing the number of physician training positions. Thus, your question is based on an inaccurate premise, and is unanswerable."
"It's a bit complicated. So the word CAESAR in English shows some anachronisms, it was borrowed from Latin but it's pronunciation reflects the pronunciation of medieval-era French loanwords and in French as well, it shows some oddities, specifically some attempts to pronounce it in a more archaic way. I'll try to give the broad details without getting too lost in the weeds.

Just to clarify, I'll use IPA, the phonetic alphabet, the consonants mostly align with English, but English vowels are way off. The IPA vowels I'll be using reflect more how the vowels are pronounced in Spanish or Italian. So *Caesar* in English is /sizər/ (or /si:zar/, the : indicates a long vowel and that varies in English). 

In Classical Latin, CAESAR would've been pronounced /kaesar/, pretty much exactly how it reads, but as time went on, Latin, like all languages changed and eventually evolved into the Romance languages. 

In the Late Latin period, three big changes happened 1. /ae/ disappeared and became the sound /ɛ/, much like the sound of English *bed*. 

2. /k/ before the sounds of /e/,/ ɛ/, /and /i/ became /ts/ in what is now France, Spain, and Portugal.  This is what caused the split between hard and soft C. 

3. The /s/ sound in the middle of the word became /z/ in between vowels. So by the fall of the western Roman Empire, CAESAR was written the same but it would've been pronounced /tsɛzar/. 

The /ts/ eventually became just an /s/ in French. Though in Spanish from Castille it ended up as /θ/, like the  <th> in English *thin*. 

Anyway, this influenced English as well. English didn't exactly borrow it from French, but the pronunciation patterns that give us the pronunciation /sizər/ did come from French. In Middle English, it would've been pronounced something like /se:zar/ (/e:/ is a long version of /e/, like the Spanish <e>). 

However, /e:/ in Modern English became /i:/, you can compare the pronunciation of the Old French loanword *feast* /fi:st/ to the more modern Latin loanword *festival*, which more or less reflects a more traditional sound as it was borrowed after the shift. 

The final vowel <a> is pronounced /ə/, this is just the sound of unstressed vowels in English, you can compare it to the <i> in *charity*. 

And obviously the <r> uses the English /ɹ/ or one of the other ""r"" sounds or rhotics in English. I've just used /r/ in IPA because that's a whole nother conversation. 

Now, there are some oddities. Mostly the sound of the AE, which by all means, should be /je/ in Modern French, like in the world *ciel* from Latin *CAELUM* or *sky*, but it's /e/, the word is *César*, not * *Ciesar*. 

The other Romance languages show similar oddities, Spanish *César*, Italian *Cesare*. What most likely happened is the name was borrowed directly from Latin later on and missed some changes or was only partially adapted to the language. This is not uncommon. 

Anyway, hopefully this wasn't too dense!

edit: as to answer your question as to when this happened, the original Old English direct from Latin was cāsere, pronounced /ka:zere/, but it also competed with Norse derived versions and now, it's more similar to an Old French loanword which has gone through the vowel changes that characterize Modern English."
"Amazing, and a new favorite post, right after the Aqueduct water slide one. Wow!"
"Great answer, but don't you mean ""Nixon's 1968 role in sabotaging peace talks""? 

Edit: from a purely subjective point of view, as someone who cut his political eye teeth on Watergate, it always struck me that Nixon was something like a protagonist from a Greek tragedy. It always seemed to me that his perception of the 1960 presidential race was that it was stolen from him by an aristocratic party boy who hadn't done a tenth of the work that Nixon had invested in his own climb to the top. And it seems to me that Nixon was determined that no election would ever be stolen from him again, and that he would win with a landslide not unlike LBJ's in 1964, securing a mandate that would make his second term better than the lackluster second term that often unfolds. In short, Nixon was fundamentally flawed and perhaps driven a bit nuts by 1960, and his presidency began and failed as a result of what was set in motion when he lost his first presidential bid. If I were to investigate the very good question of OP, that is where I would head, but these are more literary interpretations of the man and Watergate than the stuff of history."
"Part 3

The Green Revolution was the period between the 1950's and 1970's where agricultural production boomed worldwide, causing a subsequent population boom. The revolution involved the wide scale introduction of agricultural machinery such as tractors, harvesters, and advanced irrigation systems. This enabled a very small number of farmers to perform massive amounts of labor that would have previously taken dozens or even hundreds of people to complete in the same amount of time. For reference,[ in 1870 about 50% of people worked in agriculture. By 1980, that number dropped to 4%](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1981/11/art2full.pdf), and it currently sits at less than 1%. The mechanical labor was also coupled with a dedicated effort to standardize crops, both in the kinds of crops grown and the varieties of those crops to increase yields. Farms became highly specialized as a result, growing only a few or even a single crop, or raising only a single breed of animal such as cows or chickens. This accessibility to industrial scale of production led to cheaper meat prices and consistent meat quality. The average person bought their meat from a store at this point, and those stores bought large quantities of meat from farms that were engaged in the mass production of relatively few kinds of animals, limiting options for consumers. Government subsidies were highly involved in this change from hunting to farmed animals as well, driving crop prices to a never before seen low, but also incentivizing farmers to utilize as much of their land as possible. The extensive farming removed [fallow areas in which small game lived](https://www.themeateater.com/hunt/small-game/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-again-of-the-american-small-game-hunter), thus making it harder to hunt small game even in rural areas. 


What is interesting is that initially the loss of accessible hunting areas[ did not cause a decline in hunting licenses issued](https://www.fws.gov/wsfrprograms/Subpages/LicenseInfo/HuntingLicCertHistory.pdf), or even a decline in small game hunting. In the 1970's and 80's hunting small game was still popular enough that [magazines would have small game on the cover](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/135108057545294898/). However, what is important to note is how hunting patterns changed over the years. As I mentioned previously, most raccoons and assorted small game came to the kitchen table through subsistence hunting. After the Green Revolution, very few people needed to supplement their diet through hunting. This shifted the nature of hunting from something that was done out of necessity to something done for leisure. Small game hunters focused on a specific quarry to hunt, typically squirrels, rabbits, or fowl. However, beginning in the 80's and leading into the 90's big game replaced small game as the most popular form of hunting. This is still the case today, [as in 2016] (https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/fhwar/publications/2016/fhw16-nat.pdf) there were 9.2 million big game hunters, and only 3.5 million small game hunters. This is because of both the aforementioned loss of small game hunting areas, but also of the increased prevalence in trophy hunting. The concept of trophy hunting is inherently hunting large, rare, or dangerous animals and small game simply does not fit within those categories.

Raccoon is still eaten alongside other small game, but it seems that over the past several decades there has been almost a strange fascination with raccoon as a food source. [There are](https://www.jsonline.com/story/communities/lake-country/things-to-do/2019/01/22/delafield-american-legion-ready-serve-up-300-pounds-raccoon-meat/2582442002/) a number [of raccoon]( https://www.memphisflyer.com/HungryMemphis/archives/2010/05/15/raccoon-and-pinot-grigio-just-another-day-at-barbecue-fest) food festivals in the United States, and there have also been articles [written about individuals](https://www.kansascity.com/living/food-drink/article296195/Raccoon-Its-whats-for-dinner.html) who specifically hunt [and eat raccoons](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2008-01-18-0801180042-story.html) or other assorted small game. That being said, the possibility that small game hunting returns is one of uncertainty. Hunting as a whole is on the decline, and big game offers a considerably better investment for an urban hunter as trips are expensive, and big game can produce considerably more meat and overall value then smaller animals. However, there are attempts to prioritize hunting for animal control. Last week [Utah voted to make hunting](https://ballotpedia.org/Utah_Constitutional_Amendment_E,_Right_to_Hunt_and_Fish_Amendment_(2020)) and fishing the primary form of animal control in the state, arguing that it causes little environmental damage when responsibly done, leads to massive government revenues for conservation efforts, and hunters see first-hand the changes that occur within low-traveled areas, allowing observation of how the environment is changing that would otherwise be impossible. 

I hope this helped to answer your question and provide a history of raccoon consumption during the 20th century. If you have any further question, please let me know.

"I did a quick search of newspaper archives for articles from Harding's presidency that might indicate awareness of this hypocrisy and didn't find any results. That could just be because I didn't look for long enough, and in any case, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, so it's hard to draw conclusions from that about whether or not there was widespread, public outcry.

That said, the were definitely people who thought it hypocritical that the capital and the Capitol were awash with alcohol. Peter Andreas, on page 233 of his book *Smuggler Nation: How Illicit Trade Made America*, quotes Mabel Walker Willebrandt, who was Assistant Attorney General under Harding, as saying in 1929, 'I think that probably nothing has done more to disgust and alienate honest men and women who originally strongly favored the prohibition amendment and its strict enforcement than the hypocrisy of the wet-drinking, dry-voting congressmen'."

"Sweet question! It's going to be a little hard to tackle (perhaps for me, at least) because the history of Free Masonry is both long and full of popular myths and conspiracy theories that crisscross countries and different parts of history. How old? Most historians will date it back to the early 1700s with some loose claims dating back to old guilds during Medieval times. Texts do exist, however, from the late 1600s that mention Masonry. The first official Masonic Lodge was officially chartered in England in 1717 "" when several English Masons formed the Grand Lodge of England. The first official rule book was the *Constitutions of the Free-Masons*, compiled by the English clergyman James Anderson and published in London in 1723.""^(1)

Much of the mythos surrounding Free Masons, Masonic Lodges, the occult, religion, etc likely stems from this book. The text made such claims as Masonry being explicitly tied in with the creation of man or the building of Solomon's Temple. Historian Henrik Bogdan writes that Anderson's writing

>"" consists of a history of Freemasonry that starts with Adam and is then traced through the Old Testament, antiquity, and the Middle Ages, reaching all the way to the eighteenth century. In this historical overview, Freemasonry is identified as the art and practice of geometry and architecture and described as an unbroken, perennial tradition transmitted from generation to generation. The idea that Freemasonry was founded in antiquity – be it at the time of the construction of Solomon’s Temple or in pharaonic Egypt – continued to be propagated by both Freemasons and non-Masons well into the nineteenth century, and it was frequently claimed that the rituals of Freemasonry are the most ancient and consequently the most genuine rituals available to mankind. In fact, it was not until the late nineteenth century that this idea was challenged on historical-critical grounds in any serious sense.""^(2)

Why make these grandiose claims for several generations? Bogdan argues that it is an appeal to authority and legitimacy. Again, Bogdan writes, ""The invention of traditions is not unique to Western esotericism and Freemasonry, however, but can be seen as a common strategy to bolster the credibility of a wide range of movements.""^(3) The creation of these rituals, myths, and oaths, of course, drew the condemnation of both political and religious leaders throughout time that viewed such groups as potentially dangerous to their established rule or social order. This included Pope Clement XII issuing a bull (or public edict) banning Roman Catholics from joining the fraternity in 1738.^(4)  Scholar Mary Greer writes ""Masons placed a high value on brotherhood and friendship, unity and harmony, moral conduct, altruism, and secrecy. The sciences and liberal arts, and music, in particular, were also central concerns"" and goes on to elaborate and draw connections between the classical works of Bach and many Freemasons."
"Dr Bret Devereaux' blog series did not come out of nowhere. It builds on a trend in scholarship that began in the early 1990s, became dominant in academia around the early 2000s, and is now starting to make its way into the mainstream. In fact I'm certain that his series was at least partly inspired by my own posts on Sparta on this sub, and particularly [this answer on the Spartan military reputation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6rvusy/is_the_military_worship_of_the_spartans_really/dl8ns8q/) from 2 years before he started his series.

The core of the trend is to debunk the ancient ""Spartan mirage"": the notion of Sparta as a uniquely well-ordered society of noble and selfless citizens, raised in an exemplary education system to pursue a life of austerity and military excellence. Apart from the obvious assertion that ideals do not equal reality, most of this scholarship argues that Sparta was not really that unique. In most ways, it was much more like other Greek states than the Greeks themselves liked to claim. Sparta was othered, sometimes to be criticised, more often to be praised as the superior alternative to the way things were done elsewhere. But in reality, Sparta's education system, social stratification, political organisation, laws, and morality all had their parallels across the Greek world. There were only a few ways in which Spartan practices were recognisably different from those of other Greeks (some of which I highlighted in the post linked above).

Bret's blog takes these points a step further, arguing that Sparta was actively *worse* in many respects than other Greek states. Some of this may be due to sensationalism; it takes no more than a glance at the key work of the 'new Sparta', Stephen Hodkinson's *Property and Wealth in Classical Sparta* (2000), to know how dry and difficult real history can be, and the blog rightly chooses to present the material in a more vivid and engaging style. But much of it is also due to the choice to present the new scholarly consensus in contrast to the recent, immensely popular image of Sparta from the movie *300*. This movie is so extreme in its glorification of a particular (and outrageously incorrect) version of Sparta that it naturally polarises the argument. Pointing out that most of Spartan life was fairly ordinary and most of the cruel excesses we hear about date to the Roman period doesn't really feel like it does enough to defuse what amounts to fascist propaganda about an imagined society of super-soldiers. As a result, the focus of the blog series is very much on the negative. Many of these points are valid in themselves, but they give an overall impression that is probably more severe and radical than any single piece of scholarship would present. On the Spartan education in particular, Bret is clearly too negative, reflecting outdated scholarly views, [as I explained at the time the blog was written](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/crl0j5/the_spartans_had_a_brutal_staterun_education_that/ex96mn3/?context=999) (thanks /u/76vibrochamp for reminding me of this post).

Bret should be praised, though, for his recognition of the fact that the average Spartan was not, and could never become, one of the male Spartan citizens who populate the set of *300*. The Spartan population consisted overwhelmingly of people with few to no legal or political rights. The majority of the population were helots: enslaved people whose exposure to routine violence from their enslavers was as lethal as it was inescapable. In this sense Bret is absolutely right to argue that for the *average* person in Sparta - just like the average person in ancient Greece more broadly - it was a horrible place to live. The Spartans also maintained a systemic cruelty to women, installed oppressive regimes among their subject allies, inflicted corporal punishment on anyone they didn't like, and so on. Many of these things may not have been unique to Sparta, but the critical point here is that the modern worship of Sparta is unique to Sparta; it is therefore essential to keep the facts clearly in view. We can then bicker over the veracity of the claim, already made by some ancient authors, that the fate of enslaved people in Sparta was uniquely awful, more so than it was elsewhere.

Bret, it should be noted, is not a historian of ancient Greece. His PhD is in Roman military history. His knowledge of Sparta is clearly derived from extensive reading in sources and modern scholarship, but there are no doubt many conclusions that experts of the state and its history would quibble with, or that have since been overtaken by more recent scholarship. I myself had many issues with the part of the blog that deals with Spartan warfare, in which Bret commits a number of basic errors and often expounds outdated views. I wrote these up [in a thread on twitter](https://twitter.com/Roelkonijn/status/1395040090808889355) which also includes some further discussion between Bret and myself; on some points we simply do not agree. I don't think this is in any sense enough to discourage anyone from reading his blog. There is no single certain truth on many of these points. But a historian always takes a risk when writing outside of their wheelhouse, and the further outside that wheelhouse they venture, the more likely it is that a subject expert would write something very different."
"That was a fantastic discussion on the topic. 

When you say: 

>more exercise or continued painkiller injections was the better option for treatment. (Spoiler alert: physical therapy)

Do you mean President Kennedy's medical staff decided on more physical therapy? Or are you opining that PT was the better medical option? 

Do we know the specific type of injections that President Kennedy was treated with? I'm a doc myself and I've always heard about Kennedy having a historically bad back, Addison's Disease and other rumored conditions. But I've never actually looked into his specific medical history or the specific treatments provided to him and your answer has made me really curious about his individual medical profile/detailed case history.

Was it an open or a secret vote? I think that's very relevant to the op's question.
"If one looks back to older recipes such as those presented in *The English Huswife* by G. Markham through to *The Scots Kitchen,* by F. McNeill we see a breadth of ingredients and cuisines available in our history. Additionally, British baking history is brimming with historical recipes. Plum cakes spring to mind, but a great many of our most celebrated bakes are quite old indeed.

So, what happened? The short answer is rationing. The system introduced in WWII by Lord Woolton did away with a large amount of spices, sugar, and other non-essential ""luxuries."" As biographied in *Eggs or Anarchy* by W. Sitwell, Lord Woolton had a delicate digestion that reacted poorly to rich or spiced foods. In addition to his own views, the wider strategic view that anything not strictly essential to sustenance was an unnecessary waste of shipping capacity meant that these spices disappeared quite suddenly.

Of course, the British people had to adapt to this new system. The government attempted to aid this by providing example recipes within the Rationing system. The Ministry of Food released many leaflets over the years of the war, which you can read in a collected format in *Food Facts for the Kitchen Front.* This, sadly, is where it all goes downhill. The famous examples of ""Mock Duck"" and other less favoured British foods are present. The instructions often told cooks to overboil food, and seasoning was limited in the directions. Spices were almost non-existent.

Now, I feel I have to note some successes here. Carrot Cake was born from these leaflets, as an attempt to make sweet cake with little or no sugar, using an easily grown native vegetable. Apple Crumble also made its debut in this era, as a simple dish that required less resources than a full Apple Cake. Since foraging and growing your own fruit was permissible, it was an option for many to collect apples for this dish, making it quite inexpensive.

Despite these few successes, a diet of unspiced, overboiled, minimally seasoned food using a limited selection of ingredients had been forced, unilaterally, upon a populace. Even fine dining establishments and upper class households were beholden to it. Lord Woolton intended for the system to appear truly equal and fair to all. Even the King and Queen famously greeted Eleanor Roosevelt with slices of National Loaf for afternoon tea. *The West End Front* by M. Sweet is quite a good book for looking at attempts by high end hotels and restaurants to continue to offer exciting meals to their clientele.

Since the Rationing was so all encompassing, and lasted from 1939 until 1955, it left a culinary mark on a generation. That persisted through the late 20th Century as ingredients, techniques and recipes gradually returned or were introduced."

The beginning of the poem is a classic translatio imperii/translatio studii topos. It carries the story--the foundation of England--from Troy to Rome through Italy to France to Britain."
"To put it simply, the French - and particularly the people of Paris - have a long history of political protest, born out of conditions that made protest (as well as rioting, looting, and mass violence) both necessary and effective. 

Prior to the Revolution of 1789, the main form of protest in France (urban and rural) was the subsistence riot. Food insecurity was rampant in early modern France: until the early 18th century, every few decades a major famine would arise that killed off hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of people - at a time when the entire population of France was around 20 million. The last of these occurred in the winter of 1709-1710, killing around 600,000 people (3% of the population). These crises were generally triggered by abnormal weather events leading to bad harvests, but exacerbated by mismanagement of resources, and of course by wealth inequality. Grain shortages led to high prices; high prices meant that the majority of the working population, who already spent a significant portion of their income (as much as 50%) on bread, couldn't afford to eat. So, of course, people rioted. 

Subsistence riots were generally based on the notion that there was a fair price for grain, and that it was the responsibility of the king (and his proxies) to enforce that fair price. This wasn't incorrect: there was no free market in grain in the early modern period (experiments in free trade e.g. in 1774-75 didn't end well), and provisioning was legally the king's responsibility. Shortages and high prices were thus interpreted as a failure of royal authority, forcing the people to take things into their own hands. While looting did occur during these riots, it was less common than what is called ""price fixing"": taking goods in exchange for what the crowd determined to be a fair price. So while these protests were a survival tactic, they were also explicitly political: they were responding to a perceived failure of the government to do its job by taking that authority (distributing grain, setting prices) into their own hands. 

The subsistence riot was both a rural and an urban phenomenon, and was the primary form of political protest in rural areas anytime supplies were low and prices were high. While subsistence riots did occur in urban areas, city-dwellers - and especially Parisians - were not limited to a single form of political protest. They learned early on that they had numbers on their side, and that they could leverage the power of massive crowds to achieve specific political goals. These goals were varied, by they generally involved supporting one governmental faction over another - e.g. the Parlement of Paris against the royal ministries. While France may have been an absolute monarchy, Paris was a mishmash of jurisdictions with overlapping claims to authority - in which the ability to mobilize the crowd was often more important than traditional claims to authority. In the 1770s, people rioted in support of the Parlement - which led to the old Parlement being restored. In 1789, the popular finance minister Necker was dismissed, and the people rioted to have him reinstated - you know the rest. 

The people of Paris had numbers on their side: in the eighteenth century, Paris was one of the largest cities in the world, with between 500,000 and 1 million people. Those numbers are vague not only because of the lack of a formal census, but because a large chunk of the population didn't reside in the city permanently: people came and went, looking for work as day-labourers or servants, often resorting to begging when there was no work to be found. These people had little to lose and were hard to identify, given their lack of ties to their neighbourhoods, so they made excellent rioters. 

Additionally, eighteenth-century Paris had fairly high literacy rates, making it easy for rioters to share their grievances and coordinate with one another. Hand-written placards were posted all over the city at any given time: some advertising goods and services, some sharing conspiracy theories (the ever popular ""famine plot""), some making threats to the police, and so on. The police performed extensive surveillance in the hopes of preventing these protests, but ultimately they were massively outnumbered, and their reach was limited. Their rank and file were also not opposed to joining the rioters' side when it suited them - this was what happened in 1789, leading to a total breakdown in police authority. 

Essentially, by the time the Revolution came, the French - particularly within Paris, but outside of it as well - had a long tradition of violent, coordinated political protest. Moreover, over the course of the eighteenth century that tradition had modernized; it had mobilized to serve more diverse political ends than subsistence, and begun to adopt the language of nationhood and individual rights popularized by the Enlightenment. This combined with the poor harvests and political upheaval of the late 1780s to create the Revolutionary moment, but it didn't end there, as we have seen. 

Now I'm obviously an early modernist and can't speak much to the post-1800 world, but I do nevertheless see a common thread linking the popular uprisings of the Old Regime to those of the nineteenth and twentieth (and now twenty-first) centuries. Even under the most repressive of governments (monarchists don't @ me) the French people had a keen sense of what they were owed, and were willing to take it by force if necessary. Over the years they developed and refined their tactics for doing so, using whatever tools were at their disposal - the written word, the urban environment (cobblestones make great projectiles!), the sympathy of local authorities. 

Moreover - and I'm not as informed about this so maybe someone with a background in modern history can chime in - in modern era, participation in protest movements has become something of a rite of passage for French youth. While popular protest is generally a working-class phenomenon, among students and youth the class dynamics are a bit different. Young people protest not just against their oppressors but against the idea that they must necessarily become oppressors themselves - a phenomenon most evident in 1968 but present earlier and later as well. Young people will pretty much come out to protest no matter what - because they believe in the cause, of course, but also because that's what young French people do; it's part of their culture.

"In response to these new radicalizations, however, emergency credit policies to save farmers from foreclosure were approved and helped quiet down the unrest. **""Further mollifying farmer discontent were a string of profitable years in the late 1990s and early 2000s, buoyed by federal corn ethanol mandates. These policies, in combination with ever-decreasing farmer numbers, meant that the active agrarian movement dwindled, despite farm consolidation and all its economic impacts continuing at a rapid clip. Republican Party base-building, including giving increased importance to “cultural issues” such as abortion and gun rights, focused in large part on rural areas like the Midwest. The national imaginary of the Heartland shifted accordingly, erasing its progressive moments and allowing the Right to use rural myths to construct its own authenticity."" (Montenegro de Wit et al. 2019, p. 9)**

This answer could be different and much more complete, however, if we are focusing not only on farmers, but also on the wider population of the American countryside, which includes people in industries associated with agriculture and extractive activities (timber, coal mining, etc), as well as economies increasingly centered around services, also in the context of deindustrialization, but with still a strong rural cultural identity and some might say ""agrarian roots"". There is a strong academic discussion going on currently on the spread of right-wing populism in rural areas in the last years (not restricted to farmers), especially after the 2016 US election, but I do not know if I can expand on it, since this sub does not allow discussion of current events.

Can I ask a follow up question? Why did people treat manned flight as a practical impossibility before (and even after) the Wright brothers first flight?
">To what extent were the ""pro Communist, but also pro-reform"" students using the first part of that statement as an attempt at covering themselves from more serious reprisals? 

Keep in mind that the student protests were largely driven by their support of the reformist wing of the CCP (led my Hu Yaobang, the General Secretary of the Central Committee and *de jure* head of the CCP), and their discontent over the anti-reformist wing of the CCP (led by Party elders) sidelining and purging Hi Yaobang and his supporters. 

During the years leading up to the 1989 protests, conflict between reformist and conservative factions within the CCP have been rapidly intensifying. Prior to 1986, Deng Xiaoping, the *de facto* paramount leader of the CCP had been able to somewhat unite reformist and conservative factions to support Deng's reform policies (which allowed gradual economic reforms while maintaining the political status quo of one party rule). This delicate balance of power ruptured in late 1986 when Hu Yaobang and his reformist supporters pushed for election reform laws that allows intra-party democracy and genuine primary elections for local CCP elections. The conservative faction, led by powerful Party elders such as Bo Yibo and Chen Yun were furious over Hu Yaobang 's election reform proposal, and threatened to withdraw their support of Deng unless Hi Yaobang and his supporters are purged from top CCP decision making structure. While Deng did not explicitly side with the Party elders, he remained silence and tacitly gave green light for the conservative faction to stall Hu Yaobang 's political reforms and sideling Hu's faction within the CCP. This led to significant public backlash and triggered 八六学潮 or **1986 Chinese student demonstrations,** which large scale student protests erupted in major cities across the country in late 1986, protesting official corruptions and specifically the reversal of Hu's election reforms. The 1986 protests, although rarely discussed in Western news media, are important antecedents to the 1989 protests. Consequently, the Party elders blamed Hu Yaobang as being responsible for inciting the 1986 protests and intensified their purge of the reformist faction subsequently."
"When you say political motivations ""may"" have played a role in their withdrawal, I think you're greatly understating things. To add to your answer, the death of Ogedai Khan in December 1241 left an enormous power vacuum at the heart of the Mongol Empire, as different khans moved to present their claims to the throne in the ""kurultai"", a grand council where the new Great Khan would be elected.

Withdrawal was a necessity, as otherwise Batu would not be able to have any influence on what happened, and would risk being caught unawares by a rival taking the throne. It was similarly necessary as well for Batu to bring his army with him, as otherwise his own position there would have been insecure, and he would be unable to exert any influence. As such, Batu's campaign ended barely three months later, in March 1242, and his forces moved eastwards with him.

As it happened, Ogedai's widow ruled precariously as regent for five years before Ogedai's son Guyuk was ultimately elected and came to power. During this time Batu was unable to campaign in the West, as this would have left him open to an attack from his rivals, and resulted in him being unable to influence political events. When Guyuk came to the throne things were particularly unstable, as he and Batu had an intense rivalry, and there was almost open war between them. It was likely only Guyuk's death in 1248 that prevented outright civil war across the entirety of the Mongol Empire.

Following Guyuk's death, his wife served as regent, while Batu was politically ascendent. He convened a new ""kurultai"" within his territory, and rejected their invitation that he become the new Great Khan, instead nominating his cousin Mongke, who was duly elected in the middle of 1251. With his position secure, and with a close ally at his back, Batu once again began preparations for a new campaign in the West. However, he died only a few years later in 1255 before anything could come to pass.

Thereafter, the outbreak of civil war in the 1260s between Berke Khan and Hulegu Khan, prompted by the former's conversion to Islam, and the latter's sack of Baghdad and conquest of the Abbasid Caliphate, signalled the end of Mongol unity. In turn this meant that major campaigns on the scale necessary to subjugate Europe were not really practical. This was partly due to the limited resources and manpower available to the Golden Horde without support from the rest of the Mongol Empire, and also because mounting such a campaign capable of subjugating Europe would have left them critically vulnerable to attack from other Mongols, with whom they were no longer closely aligned.

For anyone curious, and who wants to know more, I'd really recommend the work of Peter Jackson, who's one of the foremost historians on Mongol Studies, and whose work has been absolutely vital in the field, both in terms of analysis of sources as well as translating them into English. He's written books like *The Mongols and the West: 1221-1410* and *The Mongols and the Islamic World: From Conquest to Conversion*, as well as many others."

"This isn't quite Roman era, but I can give some detail that the idea of ""ethnic"" restaurants existed in the Soviet Union as early as the 1930s.

Stalin had consolidated his leadership by 1929, and while he had long dismissed a Georgian national identity in favour of a more broad Soviet one, he was still a Georgian at heart. One thing he kept up was his love of Georgian food. At the crossroads of Europe and Asia, for long stretches it directly bordered Russia, Persia, and the Ottoman Empire, and thus took in cuisine from all three regions. As such Georgian food is quite varied, and has a mix of European and Middle Eastern tastes. 

It was this type of food that Stalin had brought to him in Moscow, and enjoyed not just by Stalin but his fellow Caucasians (meaning the geographic region, not a racial term in this context): Lavrenti Beria, the head of the NKVD (secret police) was also from Georgia, as was Sergo Orjonikidze (commissar of heavy industry) and Avel Enukidze (secretary of the Presidum of the Central Committee), while Anastas Mikoian (a member of the Politburo) was Armenian and Sergei Kirov (also a Politburo member) had spent considerable time in Azerbaijan. Stalin was also known for hosting long dinner parties that would stretch into the early hours of the morning, and these meetings were not just for eating: important policy decisions were made during these feasts.

Anyways, as Stalin enjoyed his native Georgian food Enukidze, who used to travel between Georgia and Moscow frequently, would bring some food back with him, mainly wine and tangerines (both are fairly prominent in Georgia, and in my opinion quite tasty). This was further developed over the years into an official set up, and by the late 1930s the Georgian Ministry of Food Production had an office in Moscow; this allowed Georgian staples like wine (Stalin was particularly fond of kindzmareuli, a semi-sweet red), Borjomi mineral water, sulguni cheese, and spices, to easily be transported to the capital. Georgian personal were also brought in to oversee things, led by Stalin’s childhood friend Aleksandre Egnatashvili; this role was vital enough that Egnatashvili was made an NKVD officer and deputy chief of Stalin’s personal security service of household affairs. 

With Stalin leading the way, Georgian food became popular among the Moscow elites, which trickled down to the masses. Restaurants began to serve some Georgian dishes, stores would offer spices and the like, and cookbooks began printing Georgian recipes. This culminated in 1940 with the opening of Aragvi, the first Georgian restaurant in Moscow. Aragvi (the name comes from a major Georgian river) catered to the elites, and to get a seat there was a sign of high standing (Beria would frequently eat there, using a private booth on the second floor). The director, Longinoz Stazhadze, was of course Georgian and had previously cooked for Stalin (he was also an NKVD officer). The restaurant itself was controlled by the Georgian Ministry of Trade, and it was the Georgians who ensured a steady stream of supplies were sent to Moscow (under the auspices of the NKVD, food security falling under their watch). 

The restaurant was exceedingly popular, and after the Second World War was followed by similar ethnic restaurants that represented the peoples of the USSR: Ararat served Armenian food, Baku offered Azerbaijani, and the Uzbekistan, not surprisingly had Uzbek (evidently they were not creative with the names). Foreigners were allowed in the Aragvi, with John Steinbeck visiting in 1947, and it was later mentioned in a 1950 *Time* article on Soviet cuisine.

These restaurants outlasted Stalin (though Stazhadze would be removed and later arrested for corruption), which is a testament to its popularity: in 1960 the head chef estimated they were selling up to 800 portions of tabaka (a fried chicken dish) a day, among other dishes. It remained a popular spot to host important parties and gatherings into the 1970s, and was frequently a place the Soviets would bring foreign delegations. That said, it was not a place you could just walk into off the street: aside from the high prices, a former deputy chef said that “it was almost impossible to get a table around the holidays unless you knew someone or could rely on connections”. Still, it was well-known, and starting in the 1960s Soviet cookbooks would include some famous recipes from the Aragvi.


A little post-script to the Aragvi: it managed to outlast the Soviet Union, but in the post-Soviet era became a meeting place for the Russian and Georgian Mafia (the Georgian Mafia was quite prominent in the later Soviet era). It shut down in 2003, but was bought shortly after and after extensive renovations was opened in 2016, but closed again in 2019, and has no signs of re-opening. That said, there is no lack of Georgian restaurants in Moscow these days.

My main source on this is one of my favourite articles: ""Edible Ethnicity How Georgian Cuisine Conquered the Soviet Table"" by Erik R. Scott, *Kritika* Vol. 13 No. 4, Fall 2012, pp. 831-858. Scott later used this as a chapter in his book *Familiar Strangers: The Georgian Diaspora and the Evolution of Soviet Empire* (2016)."
[This answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/56o4h9/how_powerful_were_soviet_computers_what/d8likn4/) from /u/joshtothemaxx partially replies to the questions and [this list of answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2legwa/in_soviet_russia_did_they_make_computers_copying/clu0tk9/) by /u/Searocksandtrees may also contain interesting information.
"I answered this question a few years ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6km3wi/why_do_we_sometimes_translate_the_names_of_native/).  Here's a copy and paste of what I wrote, though there is more discussion and back and forth at the original link.

Linguist here who works with several different First Nations communities. The conventions for translating or not translating names into English really have no rules beyond convenience and going with what goes.  As far as convenience is concerned, here's a few trends.

-- Nations with long polysynthetic meaningful names generally get their names translated.  The means that almost all Cree, Ojibwa, and Sioux names seem to get translated. Think Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake - Sitting Bull.

BUT! this doesn't seem to hold true since back in the earliest days of at least American history, many names from nations very closely related to these same nations **didn't** get translated. Powhatan, Pocahontas, etc. Possible (likely) differences include the fact that in the earlier times, Tribes like the Narraganset and such were considered valuable trading partners and also equally human, despite the serious differences, while during the later period of western expansion, there was a lot less respect and willingness to accommodate non-English names.

Jumping further to the Pacific Northwest, while many names *are* easily analyzable and translatable, there is a longstanding local tradition of generally *not* translating names as they are passed back and forth between language groups. Many people I know have names that are clearly from neighbouring or even more distant nations, and while they might change pronunciation, they aren't translated.  This is reflected in English usage where we refer to Chief Pootlass, Chief Maquinna, and so on.

The ""MEANINGFUL"" part is important as well - In Cree for example (and I think in Lakota/Dakota as well) all names are meaningful, meaning that they use the same morphemes as the rest of the language. So any name can be translated, and in fact it's fairly natural to translate when speaking, given that people don't draw strong distinctions between ""name language"" and ""normal language"".  In the language I'm working with now, Nuxalk, the Nuxalk root word dictionary includes several hundred names as separate entries, and it's very clear that many or most names are not immediately translatable, furthermore because of the suffixes available for creating names, multiple names exist with basically the same meaning, but pronounced different to distinguish people, so you can't simply translate all their names or you end up with a lot of confusion.

Another impact in this later period is the prevalence of residential type schools, and how common it was to give people ""Christian"" names, so often when people wanted to use an easy to say name, they'd go with ""John"" or ""Herb"" and so on.

This same trend played out on the prairies of Canada, where many First Nations had some European bloodlines in them, and if people needed to they could fall back on a European name to make things go smoother, and were often known by both. Many in my family had both Cree names and English names, but when one of them signed treaty six, he signed with his Cree name.

Another obvious factor is pronunciation.  Some languages have tones, pops, nasals, and sound just really difficult to an English ear.  So more likely to be changed.

Last factor I'll mention is the presence of trade languages or the medium of communication.  In the prairies, a LOT of First Nations had access to English or French speakers from hundreds of years of trading.  New people come, you can always explain your name.  Other areas used pidgins like Chinook Wawa or Mobilian Jargon, and nicknames were a common part of the playfulness that tended to result from using these languages. Names like Skookum John and such that sound mixed were often Pidgin nicknames.

So in conclusion, there are a lot of different reasons: linguistic reasons, political reasons, power reasons, or simply going to the preferences of whoever first wrote the name down or how the first meeting went."
"We often hear about the Catalonians and the Basques. Especially in the context of differentiating between the Catalonians and Basques on the one hand and the Spanish on the other. Did the Galicians and the Andalusians have a similar reaction, and if yes, was it of any significance?"
"I wrote an answer to a similar question to this, link [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i9qy28/did_americans_start_viewing_alcohol_as_a/g1icrx8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) In that answer, I argue that the decline in the acceptability of workday alcohol consumption can be tied back to anti-corruption initiatives in the mid to late 20th century, particularly as found in the campaign rhetoric of Carter."
Thank you so much for a thorough and detailed answer! It looks like my suspicion that I might just be misconstruing mid-late 20th century country based on my own tastes was correct. Could you elaborate a bit on the distinction between Americana and country/folk? Is it just country music that is divorced from or in rebellion towards the Nashville sound? I see the term get used a lot but I’ve never quite understood it.

"In that article is this quote:

""Dismayed observers were beginning to wonder whether his mind was misfiring: in one speech (April 30, 1973), he declared John Ehrlichman and Bob Haldeman the two greatest civil servants in American history and, in the same speech, fired them.""

What is the story behind that?"
"In addition to the answers already provided, there is also evidence of upperclass members of society having ""borderline religious"" experiences. For example, in a biography of Rev. Robert Hall, an English Baptist minister who lived 1764-1831, it's written:

Mr. Hall it runs was present in Westminister Abbey at Handel's commemoration \[an event that took place in 1784 to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of George Frideric Handel, a Baroque composer\]. The King, George III, and his family were in attendance. At one part of the performance of the *Messiah* (the ""Hallelujah chorus"") the King stood up, a signal for the whole audience to rise; he was shedding tears. Nothing, said Robert Hall, had ever affected him more strongly; it seemed like a great act of national assent to the fundamental truths of religion.

As you can see, even nobility who had heard orchestral works many times before could be affected in such an overwhelming manner."

"> At the time it was drafted, there was little concept of a nation of “Americans.” There was a nation of North Carolina, a nation of Massachusetts, a nation of New York, etc. The constitutional convention was an effort to find ways these many small nations could work together to strengthen each other.

This is kind of a broad question, but would it be fair to say that the founding fathers-at the time the Constitution was written-were hoping for something like the European Union is today, or were they hoping for more statehood type unity?"
"There is no single accepted answer among academic historians or even among leftists. As one might expect, for such a politically charged and relevant question it becomes *really* difficult to separate history proper from politics. 

One reasonable way to approach the question is to look at what the leaders of the revolution thought and how they preceived or justified authoritarianism. It's also important to understand their political experience and context. 

A good starting point I think is the late 19th century, when the Second International, an association of primarily Marxist parties across Europe, suffered an internal crisis between *reformists* and *revolutionists*. At that point, the revolutionary character of Marxism was not yet agreed upon among its followers, and within the parties reformist Marxists tended to hold sway. Unlike modern social democrats, these reformists still (if only nominally) held the ultimate goal of overcoming capitalism; the major disagreement was if this could be achieved by working entirely within the bourgeois state. This question of reform or revolution is discussed with some more historical context in the revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg's [eponymous pamphlet](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1900/reform-revolution/index.htm), written at the height of this conflict. [Eduard Bernstein's works](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bernstein/index.htm) give the reformist perspective.

(As an aside, Rosa Luxemburg was a revolutionist in Germany and Poland who collaborated extensively with Lenin. She would later disagree tactically with Lenin during the Russian revolution but, as I believe, they had no fundamental doctrinal differences-- one can expect that Luxemburg's comments about reform and revolution are broadly the same as Lenin's)

As Europe approached the First World War, the reformist tendency within socialist parties would deepen and even take on a nationalistic character. By then, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) had become the dominant socialist party within Europe, having achieved significant labor reforms and boasting a membership in the millions. This, combined with the threat of invasion from a deeply reactionary Russia, compelled German reformists to associate socialism with German patriotism, and national defense with the defense of socialism (ironically, a similar trend would occur in France *against* Germany, which many Frenchmen perceived as a reactionary threat against their republic). Revolutionists, on the other hand, tended to have an internationalist outlook, believing that only an international revolution against imperialist warfare could defend socialism.

When WW1 broke out at last, the SPD (and most other European parties) voted in favor of war, beginning a period of *Burgfriedenspolitik* wherein the SPD abstained from strikes and other subversive activities against the war effort. The revolutionists and few reformists who disagreed with this policy splintered away from the SPD into the Independent SPD, the Spartacist League, and eventually the German Communist Party. Notably, Lenin's party in Russia also opposed war by majority, foreshadowing the dominance of revolutionists in the upcoming struggle.

This is all to say that the events leading up to WW1 and the Russian revolution precipitated huge, seemingly irreconciliable divisions between the reformist and revolutionist factions of the European socialists. This conflict would take on its most bloody form in the 1918-19 Spartacus uprising at the end of the German revolution: once in power, the now wholly reformist SPD would brutally crush their revolutionist counterparts as they attempted to establish worker's states. Remember again that these were former comrades who, decades ago, would have relied on each other's cooperation.

So what does this have to do with authoritarianism in Russia? The leaders of the Russian revolution were internationalists, and had counted on the victory of the German revolutionaries and, hence, the victory of a sweeping revolution across the world. The hope was that, since Germany was among the foremost industrial powers of the world, it could provide material necessities and alleviate the stresses of war, in turn allowing for demilitarization and democratization across both Germany and Russia. This didn't happen-- again, the German revolutionaries were massacred by reformists. It's possible that the Bolsheviks miscalculated, or simply that the Bolsheviks had no other choice but to push forward and *hope* that Germany would turn around. Probably both. In any case, the ascendant Bolsheviks were left in a very, *very* difficult situation: they were in charge of a war-weary nation with hostile states (particularly now Germany) on all sides and powerful counterrevolutionaries within. Realistically there was only one thing they could do besides capitulate-- dig in, and use the full power of the state to survive for as long as possible.

Rosa Luxemburg summarizes this impasse pretty well in [The Russian Tragedy](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/09/11.htm) (which is short but extremely useful in understanding the attitudes of communists at the time -- a must read!):

> The awkward position that the Bolsheviks are in today, however, is, together with most of their mistakes, a consequence of basic insolubility of the problem posed to them by the international, above all the *German*, proletariat. To carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat and a socialist revolution in a single country surrounded by reactionary imperialist rule and in the fury of the bloodiest world war in human history – that is squaring the circle. Any socialist party would have to fail in this task and perish – whether or not it made self-renunciation the guiding star of its policies. ... **Such is the false logic of the objective situation: any socialist party that came to power in Russia today must pursue the wrong tactics so long as it, as part of the international proletarian army, is left in the lurch by the main body of this army.**

As an example of ""wrong tactics,"" Trotsky discusses in a [report](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/ffyci-1/ch02.htm) that the early Soviet worker's militia could not confront the vastly better-equipped and better-trained German army, nor even the relatively more experienced armies under White control. As a result, Trotsky was compelled to professionalize the army, institute harsh drafts, and even incorporate captured White officers at gunpoint just to win the civil war. Both he and Lenin recognized that these measures were counter to the principles of the revolution but were nonetheless necessary if the revolution were to survive at all.

As we now know, neither Germany nor any comparably industrialized country underwent a successful communist revolution. The Soviets would remain isolated long after Lenin's death, and Stalin would further entrench authoritarianism-- what started as emergency measures became standard procedure when the emergency never went away. (EDIT: This part feels a bit insufficient. I don't want to attribute the entrenchment of authoritarianism as something unique to Stalin as a person -- it was likely a combination of broad social forces and personality. I might point to the rising nationalism in Marxist reformists are an analogous process, but this would require a more detailed treatment of Stalin I am not really prepared to make.)

For subsequent revolutions, the ""fruit from a poisoned tree"" situation you described is sort of right-- these revolutions drew explicitly from Lenin's revolutionary measures and, sometimes less explicitly, from Stalin's entrenchment. One might even say that they were all part of a single, broader revolution, and can't be treated as isolated cases. Later on certain countries like Cambodia and North Korea would spin off on their own and abandon communism even in name, but since they faced the same problems of political isolation, they had at least an excuse to remain authoritarian. 

It's probably not true that failure was inevitable, which would ignore the later history of Trotskyism and other oppositional forces in, most notably, the USSR and the China. But I don't want to spin off into counterfactuals-- things *could* have happened differently, but they didn't, and that's the question you're asking.

In summary:

* Pre-WW1 politics caused a deep rift between reformist and revolutionary factions in European socialism

* This led to the (short-term) success of the Russian revolution and the failure of the German revolution, as reformists were much more powerful in the latter country

* Without German support, the Russian Bolsheviks had to enact emergency authoritarian measures to remain afloat

* Later, the static international situation allowed authoritarianism to be entrenched

* Future revolutions would emulate the Bolsheviks and in turn face the same problems of political isolation

Note again that this is just a single perspective, taking into account mostly primary sources from the leaders of the Russian and German revolutions. Still, this is an important point of view I think, and the one I'm most familiar with.

"Good thoughts. I think you’re missing one thing though. While the Bible doesn’t directly mention Alexander the Great. I always found this part of Ezekiel interesting.

Ezekiel 26:3-6 - 3 therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea casting up its waves. 4 They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers; I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock. 5 Out in the sea she will become a place to spread fishnets, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord. She will become plunder for the nations, 6 and her settlements on the mainland will be ravaged by the sword. Then they will know that I am the Lord.

- Ezekiel predicts the destruction of Tyre in a very specific way. He says it will be destroyed down to the ground and it's stones tossed into the sea.

- Nebuchadnezzar attacks but doesn’t finish the job. Later,  in Ezekiel the author admits that Nebuchadnezzar didn’t completely fulfill the prophecy (29:18)

- 160ish years later Alexander the Great shows up and fulfills the rest of the prophecy almost word for word by destroying mainland Tyre and throwing its buildings into the sea to create a bridge out to the island of Tyre."
You historians are so amazing. Thanks so much for taking the time to write. So many of us non-historians really appreciate it!
"I love your linked answer, but I feel that this is much more arbitrary than the response makes it sound by suggesting it is a 'decision we make as a society.' I am a medievalist, so that is where my experience of this issue comes from, but there are lots of contradictory fashions over time in the various European languages common to European medieval scholarship for rendering names as they are in the original or translating them, and while these decisions often have clear goals behind them (respecting original languages, conveying an actual—rather than a translated name, making historical accounts more relatable by using simple names) at the same time they often ... don't. There is no clear rule for how or when to translate names and it is often all over the map. Complicating this, the materials we (medieval historians) are often using as sources are Latin, so the people at the time thought the names were translatable into Latin, and later historians, used to translating names from Latin, have localized the names in their translations. Even when common names are translated, rare names tend not to be translated: a favourite of mine is Abbot Deodedit (God's Gift) of Monte Cassino.

It is very sub-field dependant, too: Ethiopians (I work on Ethiopia as well as Europe) also have meaningful names, but we use their Amharic(/Tigrinya/Ge'ez/etc.) names in transliteration rather than translating, e.g. GebreYesus as Servant of Jesus. This is arguably destroying information, as Ethiopian names often express aspirations for the children. Of course, Ethiopian names are not written locally in Roman script either: for a historical name that is being transcribed from Ethiopic, we would generally use the main transliteration systems (that of the Encyclopaedia Aethiopica or the Beta Maseheft project) but living Ethiopians often have their own preferred transliterations of their names (using a much simpler, older, and less-accurate transcription system) that supersede the more accurate transliteration systems in academic use in Roman scripts.

Lest we think this is somehow consistent in other languages, I will risk incurring the sub's wrath by invoking an anecdote: I have an Irish name that is a translation of an English name which is a version of a Biblical Hebrew name, and work in two other countries (Ethiopia, Austria). In travels for my work, I have been referred to by practically every localization of the name including responding to the Irish, English, German, and Amharic in the same trip."
"Hello. If you don't get an answer to this here, consider posting it as a separate thread. It will get more visibility that way, and so be more likely to get answered."
"Fascinating. Thank you for being the person who finally answered my question 

I find it surprising that when I was born (1994) there were still private gun shops in Mexico

Also, form what you explain it seems that gun culture was already in decline since the end of the revolution. The events you describe certainly accelerated that decline, but I wonder what other factors played a role"
"Yes. 

One example is that a lot of Romans in many historical inspired films of some kind or another wear leather or similar bands around their wrists, which isn't what they seem to have done in reality. You can see mosaics of real soldiers and politicians and they are basically never seen to be wearing them in reality.

Another is thinking of everyone in the Roman empire as acting like a citizen in Rome. Especially given that these days we might expect a nationstate to have basically the same language, culture, religion, and food, like in Denmark, and for everyone to be citizens by virtue of being born in the country or being born to citizens living in the country, which is basically everyone who is born in most countries these days, you can forget that this isn't how citizenship worked back then. Some emperors decreed common citizenship grants at periods, but for most of it's history, the people of many provinces were seen to be citizens of that other place under their own kings or polities that just happened to be loyal to Rome, providing some tax revenue to fund an army and if it was agriculturally rich like Egypt or North Africa, send in food shipments. Not even Italians were given common citizenship until the Social War, hundreds of years later.

If you are thinking about a Roman, something that comes to your mind will probably be tied up roughly in the 1st century AD, with the height of the emperors, the military looking like they do with the round rectangular Scutum, the pila, the lorica segmentata, and so on. The Roman Republic might be in the picture but most people don't understand that Rome wasn't a republic like today with an elected legislature up for election every few years and same with a single head of state with a cabinet. The laws were only able to be passed by one of the assemblies, imperium was wielded by magistrates and conferred solely by assemblies, judgement of penalties including executions were done by the people either by jury or by popular assembly, and the Senate, while important, was ultimately consultative.

If people think of inequality in the Roman Republic and especially the Roman empire, people might think of patricians vs plebians. But if they are talking after about 200 BCE, the differences were largely irrelevant to how Rome worked politically. The patricians had plenty of privileges like 6 voting blocks dedicated to maybe a couple thousand patricians in the comitia centuriae, but most among the equitae and some in the first class in the centuriae were richer than the patricians and had much more power in elections. Most senators would ultimately come from them, as would eventually many magistrates. 

And hardly anyone ever thinks of the Romans as having ever been a true kingdom, but it was for as much time as America has been a country under it's current constitution. It lasted a long time. But it was vital to understanding the origin of much of Roman culture, urban development, even the Pomerium, and how it grew into a city state able to be the dominant power in the area about 50 km around it. 

You probably also think of the Roman military generally as being a highly professional force of volunteer Romans, signing a contract much like today (although for longer periods). For about half of ancient Rome's history, it was based on a citizen militia, of which only about a third of it was even in the maniple system rather than the hoplite system borrowed from the Greeks. For about half of the late Roman history, it was very often foreign and provincial volunteers with few ties to Rome, often you would have a hard time looking at one and realizing that they are not medieval soldiers without a significant background and exposure to the idea that Rome ever operated that way.

People also fail to understand that any culture even in basically ideal circumstances of national unity (like English from 1660 to today) will have substantial changes. Why would the Latin of Romulus or even Julius Caesar sound that similar to the Latin of Romulus Augustus or Diocletian? We get annoyed by sound changes in English from Shakespeare's time, let alone how hard it is to understand Chaucer, 600 years ago. 

We also might tend to overemphasize the city of Rome in our imagination during the late imperial age too, Ravenna and Mediolanum were both capitals and more populated, and there is of course Constantinople (called at the time Nova Roma). Some emperors barely knew Rome, many perhaps only going to the city to get confirmed by the senate as emperor and leaving on campaigns for years, often rising through the ranks from the provinces as commanders in armies who ultimately won out in a succession struggle which may or may not have been caused by them assassinating the old emperor. 

And this is before I even touch on the continuation of the Roman Empire until 1453. 

The Roman Civilization is a very diverse topic, covering 2200 years of history. Could you imagine a single state lasting from almost Hannibal himself pillaging outside Rome until now?  What would remain the same over that time? What would be different?"
"This is a great question–Unfortunately I can't speak to the chamber/bedroom side of it, but I can talk about the parlor/living room side of things some, at least in an American context.


I think it is important to understand that there is never a perfect correspondence between the names we use for spaces, the spaces themselves, and the way those spaces are used. So, the shift from talking about parlors to talking about living rooms might reflect the creation of a new type of room, it might reflect a change in the way rooms were used, or it might just be drift in language, with one term coming to replace another.  The other thing to understand is that there is always a divide between the ways that architects, home magazines, and domestics ""experts"" intend for certain spaces to be used and the ways that they are actually used in practice. That said, let's get started:


One of the earliest styles of home in North America is the “hall-and-parlor” plan, where the first floor would be split into two rooms: hall and parlor (duh). A variant of this is the “center-passage” plan, where the hall and parlor were separated by an entry hallway, often with stairs leading to chambers above. In this system, the “hall” was a multi-purpose room combining cooking, cleaning, and often family dining and socializing. In theory, the parlor was a more formal space, used to entertain guests, or perhaps for family dining or socializing. In practice, this division was enforced more or less rigidly. In some cases, the parlor may have been a truly genteel space, in others it might be used as a bedroom, or a general-purpose room indistinguishable from the hall. This would depend on a variety of factors: ethnicity, class, size of house, size of family, etc.


In the 19th century, under a lot of different influences, many American homes became more complex, less symmetrically planned, and contain a wider variety of spaces. There was also an increasing interest in separating the informal and formal parts of the house. An example of the latter trend, if not the former, can be seen in the prototypical house plan promoted by Catherine Beecher in her book, The American Woman's Home. This plan is effectively a center-passage plan, with a few variations. One unlabeled room, is used for dining, sleeping, and family socializing, and is provided with movable screens that can create some degree of separation between these different functions. The other room, labelled ""drawing room"" but effectively a parlor, is used exclusively for genteel uses: ""reserved for the reception-room of friends, and for our own dressed leisure hours,"" in Beecher's words. The kitchen is shrunk into a kind of ""galley kitchen,"" connecting the two spaces and tucked behind the stair hall.


It may seem odd to promote the idea that half of the house should be dedicated to receiving guests, but this is in line with the so-called ""cult of domesticity"" that Beecher helped to promote during the 19th century. This ""cult"" held that the world was divided into the masculine, rough, exterior world of work, labor, and industry, and the feminine, refined, cultured, and restive world of the home. This ideology of ""separate spheres"" promoted the creation of formal, beautiful, and artistically decorated interior spaces that would soothe the nerves of weary husbands, and would inculcate good manners and Christian values in children.


(Of course, the problem with the ""separate spheres"" idea, is that the home continued to be a space of work. A side effect of this is that kitchens began to shrink, and be tucked away towards the back of the house as a kind of specialized workspace, with no space in them for socializing or dining.)


Beecher's exact plan was never very widely adopted, and home builders in the 19th century began to favor complex, asymmetrical plans with a variety of rooms, partly enabled by the adoption of new house-framing systems that enabled greater flexibility compared with earlier timber-framing. But the broader idea of creating genteel spaces within the home was widely adopted, and many many homes created in the 19th century had formal ""parlors"" that were, in practice, reserved for receiving guests, or interacting in a refined manner. These spaced would be ""artistically"" decorated, carpeted and curtained, and would include new mass-produced artistic experiences: print reproductions of paintings or biblical scenes, photographs of relatives or famous men, perhaps a family bible, as well as factory-made furniture featuring patterned upholstery and carved detail work. These sorts of spaces became a near-ubiquitous part of middle, or upper-middle class American homes in the 19th century.


This model came under attack however, towards the end of the 19th-century. Increasingly, these sorts of spaces were seen as being characterized by an excessive, even stifling formality. Female domestic writers began to argue that these spaces were difficult to clean, and that all the drapery provided space for dust, or unclean air. Male writers argued that parlors were too feminine, overly aestheticized, and impossible to relax in. The Ladies' Home Journal, perhaps the most widely-read magazine in America, began a dedicated assault on the parlor in the late 1890s, refusing to publish house plans with parlors in them.


Into the void comes the living room. This was driven by a few different cultural shifts. Domesticity in the late 19th and early 20th century was increasingly interested in efficiency and cleanliness. Parlors were associated with certain trends in decoration, including lots of drapery, carved wood, carpets, and little nooks and crannies that could collect dust. As a result, domestic reformers advocated for spaces that were more simply decorated and easier to clean. The domestic ideal also began to emphasize relaxation over sophistication, and embraced a kind of neo-rustic simplicity over the Victorian ideal that emphasized beauty as a means of cultivating taste and Christian values.


There is bit of a paradox here. Homes at the turn of the twentieth century were on the one hand striving towards a kind of rusticity, looking backwards from the overly formal Victorian fashions. On the other hand, homes were looking forwards towards new technology, and new ideals of sanitation and industrial efficiency. As a result, these new plans almost never combined “living rooms” with kitchens, as had been the case with the 18th century “halls” in hall-and-parlor houses. The kitchen remained a dedicated workspace, separated from the rest of the house. It would not be until the 1920s or 30s that  “open kitchens” were more widely adopted, with a real pickup after WWII.


In any case, the parlor did not fit in with either ideal: it was neither rustic and informal, nor modern and “efficient.” As a result, it was increasingly rejected by architects and domestic writers. Again, there is a bit of ambiguity. In some cases, living rooms were formally different from earlier parlor plans: they might be open to the dining room, or maybe even to the stair hall. In other cases, the ""ban"" on parlors in the Ladies' Home Journal plans really was just a question of labelling the room differently, with the change in language reflecting a different kind of use, but not a different architectural form. Given that many Americans did not actually use their parlors in such a rigidly formal way, the rise of the living room may have been a purely linguistic shift for some, with no attendant change in either architectural form, or use. Also, it is worth noting that many people may have continued to like parlors and the attendant ideals they carried with them, even when architects and domestic reformers told them they weren’t “supposed” to.

"I'm really glad that Fish Event Horizon is the name of my new rock band, because it's exactly the phenomenon we want to be talking about here.

It is indeed a legitimate term used in legitimate scholarship to refer to the period in the 900s (in France, at least), when fish consumption seems to have increased drastically around the North/Baltic/&c Sea areas in northern Europe. Bones from saltwater fish in particular are found further and further inland.

As for a vast ocean? Yes, that's exactly what medieval people believed [lay around the known world.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Radkarte_MKL1888.png/220px-Radkarte_MKL1888.png) (Also regions where the earth was so hot it was on fire, and also cannibals.)

So that's pretty good on those points.

Onwards.

Medieval villages were not isolated outposts, and medieval peasants were not [Kevin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/219w2o/whos_the_dumbest_person_youve_ever_met/cgbhkwp/)

It's important to get over the conflation of villages in medieval Europe with the stereotypical ""pioneer"" (imperialist) outpost of the 19th century American West. Rural life was usually not based on subsistence farming. An ever-proliferating number of market charters shows just how much people depended on local trade, especially when you consider how a small a percentage of market hosts must have wanted legal recognition.

Christopher Dyer argues that 10ish miles was around the maximum distance from villages to a large village or small town with a market. During the German Reformation, chroniclers speak admirably of villages walking eleven miles just to hear a Protestant preacher, so that seems like a fairly reasonable maximum as far as isolation goes.

Fifty miles, too, is closer than we might think even in the Middle Ages. Marjorie Boyer calculated that somewhere around 28-33 miles per day was average for long-distance travelers.

There was plenty of traffic *to* villages, too. Peddlers; specialists in various medical disciplines (not that you necessarily wanted the dentist to show up...but I digress); relatives from other villages; young adults who had moved to cities to work better jobs and earn money returning home permanently or for a visit.

And priests, believe it or not! In the late Middle Ages, they often rotated among churches when there weren't enough priests to go around, or when a village couldn't afford to pay a priest enough money to survive there. (In 15th century Germany, there's one case where multiple villages had to band together to hire even *one* priest to share among them. Plenty of medieval priests were really hurting for money, working second jobs, &c.)

Priests are especially useful here because they might have fairly significant education. But also, because the nature of late medieval Christianity required some knowledge of world geography. Roads to Rome and beyond to Jerusalem, most importantly. The idea of ""stationary pilgrimages,"" in which someone who would never be able to go to Rome could still ""follow along"" spiritually by thinking about it or envisioning themselves along the path, was...okay, my knowledge of this is from 1500, but perhaps you're willing to forgive me a century because it's pretty cool and SO medieval to get afterlife credit for a *crusade* by picturing yourself walking to Rome.

And to finish, the late 1300s-1400s are a fascinating era in European history because it's sort of the ""waking up"" of the general population to wider events. That's not to say that peasants in 1100s Catalonia weren't protesting their lords' brutal mistreatment. But--for example--in 1100s Germany, aristocratic nuns Hildegard von Bingen and Elisabeth von Schönau were speaking out against that era's flavor of schism in the Church. The visionary prophets active during the 1378-1415 Great Schism came from the middle and even lower classes.

The wider world--international affairs--was more *relevant* to average people, both in the sense of being interesting and in the sense of it affecting their lives (materially or spiritually or politically) more.

So basically: people ate ocean fish, there was a good amount of local foot traffic, plenty of opportunity to learn about the goings-on of the world, plenty of interest in it, and you didn't have to take the girl out of hickville because there was no true hickville."
"While I appreciate your main point--that we should not look back at the notion of democracy or republics with contemporary sense of inevitability--I wholeheartedly disagree with your main contention, at least for the Revolution after 1792.  (you seem to be working from Alfred Cobban?  Cobban is very slanted...  or maybe Schama?  he's also profoundly misleading.) 

Namely, while your broad contentions hold for 1789 and 1790 (and maybe into 1791),  I think you are *massively* undervaluing how bitterly anti-*monarchical* most Revolutionaries were after 1792.  And not just in Paris, but in most urban areas, and even in some portions of the countryside.  

""Aristocrat"" was a swear-word in France by 1792. 

""Vive la **République!**"" was virtually synonymous--by 1792--with ""Vive la France!"".

A common accusation hurled at powerful Girondin or even Jacobin politicians (like Danton or Robespierre) by their opponents was that they wanted to be (or were acting like) ""kings.""   People were *killed* over these accusations.  (people like Danton.  And Robespierre...!) 

To be accused of being a ""royalist"" during the uprising of the Vendee was a death sentence. 
 
To *attack* the Republic... or to propose a return of a monarch after 1793 (when the Bourbon king was safely dead) was again most frequently punished by being referred to the tender mercies of the guillotine.  

The French Revolution, in short, was *radical*.  And I think your answer erroneously effaces that radicalism.  

Some suggestions on sources:  

The older Marxist historians emphasized its radicalism, i.e. Soboul's *Sans Culottes* (1968) Rude's *Crowd in the French Revolution*.  It's the reaction of the 1980s (Cobban, Furet) who really try to downplay the radicalism--and radical republicanism--of the Revolutionaries.  (for political reasons, I think.)   But later historians, whether Patrice Higgonet, Lynn Hunt, or Suzanne Desan... have all written about the Revolution (on very different topics) in ways that continue to underscore how fundamentally radical--and *profoundly Republican*--the Revolution was.

So OP's question is really quite puzzling.

Since being an outspoken ""monarchist"" in 1794 would get you immediately denounced by your outraged neighbors, and publicly undermining ""the Republic"" meant death during the Terror (and even well afterwards), and even Napoleon played his revolutionary (and anti-aristocratic) credentials in his rise to power circa 1799...  why, then, was it suddenly okay in 1804 to once again role-play the monarch...?   

While it's out of my area of expertise, I might throw out the idea that Napoleon's symbolic ""return"" to monarchy--not just the title of Emperor in 1804, but also the self-representation leading up to the coronation--was a play to the more conservative French countryside (who were, after all, more important to Napoleon, in terms of providing the backbone of volunteers and conscripts to the Grande Armee).   Napoleon had learned that more radical Republican urban centers could be controlled by force (witness the closing of the Jacobin Clubs, Napoleon's abolishing of the Directory with a whiff of grapeshot, etc. etc.)... just so long as the *soldiers* remained loyal.  

And the pseudo-monarchy was all about keeping the army loyal (I would suggest).  

My source for this is a recent book reviewed in the New York Review of Books... but I can't remember the author or title.

EDIT:  aha, found it!  Mikaberidze's *The Napoleonic Wars*.  I've not read it yet, but Lynn Hunt did a great review of it in the New York Review of Books, March 2020 issue."
"This is a great point, in general. However, in this case, Edwards did dig up some articles from a staunchly Republican, anti-Grover newspaper that reported on (at least) the public's approval of the wedding: ""No American wedding has attracted such general and amiable attention.""  That can't have been easy to print, so it stands a good chance of reflecting circumstances to a reasonable degree.

There's also the comparison to newspaper articles during the 1884 scandal over Grover's probable illegitimate son. Of course we shouldn't expect a mildly-Democratic newspaper to splurt the same sensationalist mudslinging as the Republican ones had earlier, but the difference is...extreme.

(There is very, very little scholarship on Frank--Grover's sister Rose gets the attention, for very understandable reasons--but what does exist tends to focus on Frank's popularity and Grover's possession of at least some political acumen, by way of arguing against any major contemporary-squickiness.)"
"I am not a trained historian, but rather a Political Science guy, but I feel qualified to answer this. The 2000 election for those of us too young to remember was a shitshow. In fact, news stations had to recall their initial projections twice. Following the election night drama, the election continued on for almost a month before ending in a controversial supreme court decision.

Let us start with election night itself. Early in the night, major networks called Florida for Al Gore. NBC was the first network to call it at 7:50 p.m. EST, but quickly the other major networks called it as well. However, as the night grew older more and more data came out of Florida that implied the calls were too early. Two hours later, CNN retracted their call after noticing a change between what the polling data they based their call on, and the actual results that was streaming on. Following the CNN call, the other major stations withdrew their decisions as well. 

Then early the next morning a little after 2 am, most of the major networks (CNN, FOX, CBS, etc.) called Florida for Bush (AP being the only exception). However, this devision would also be recalled around two hours later, as more votes came in which favored Gore. The final results on election night showed Bush up by 1,784 votes which triggered an automatic recount. 

The automatic recount brought up a lot of questions. Because of the way Florida conducted its ballots in 2000, there were some ballots that had trouble being counted. Florida used a ballot similar to a push-pin, where you pushed out a dangling (or chad as they became known) to vote for a candidate Occasionally, the chads so to speak on these ballots would not be fully disconnected resulting in a hanging chad, which the voting machines could not accurately read. This lead to even further confusion in the counting. 

After conducting the first recount, the new official total showed Bush with a 537 vote lead. Because of how close this margin was, both the Bush and Gore campaigns filed legal briefs and cases to try and get support. Although Gore won at the Florida Supreme Court, ultimately, the United States Supreme Court ruling in favor of Bush in Bush v. Gore. This ended the recount and was decided on partisan lines (i.e. the five conservatives on the court voted in favor of Bush and the four liberals for Gore). 

Now comes the ultimate question, was the election stolen. First off, there is no concrete evidence that Gore would have won the election. A group of media organizations conducted an extensive review of the disputed ballots that were ruled on in Bush v. Gore and found it would not have decided the election in favor of Gore. However, they also didn’t claim that Bush certainly won the total vote. Besides the over 43,000 votes that were at stake during Bush v. Gore, there was an even broader group of 175,010 ballots that was rejected in other counties. 

The election of 2000 in Florida was basically a statistical tie. The votes that were counted under Florida Law resulted in Bush winning by 537 votes. Either candidate could probably have claimed victory under this close of a race, but the systems favored George Bush (the Florida Secretary of State was Republican and the Supreme Court of the US was controlled by Republicans). So in my mind, it was not a stolen election just an uber close election where the system benefited Bush.

"Anthropologist of the South Pacific foodways and agriculture here.

I can't fully answer the question because I don't think anyone can truly objectively explain why pop-culture and discourses have largely excluded Polynesian-American contact, even if it is worthwhile pointing out patterns that could partly explain this lack of popularity. 

In my anthropological sector and people do and have been talking and arguing in favour or against Polynesian-American contact for a long time (decades), but perhaps the biggest factor explaining why popular discourse has ignored it is the fact Polynesians and Indigenous Americans interacting has only been decisively concluded a couple years ago, with human DNA demonstrating genetic admixture circa 1200 shared between Pa’umotuans, Marquesians, and Mangarevans (island groups were the study was conducted, does not mean other Polynesian peoples are not related, also very important to note the three are rather far apart and distinct cultural groups even if they did sustain contact and trade with each other) and South American DNA closest to modern day Colombians ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2487-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2487-2)).

Indeed, before 2020 there was no veritably unequivocal evidence for contact. 

Sure, linguistic evidence for sweet potato and the fact it was in Polynesian islands pre-European contact made a strong case, but DNA studies for Polynesian sweet potatoes support the theory the root crop floated through the Pacific and arrived in the South Pacific tens of thousands or years before the Austronesian expansion even started ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221830321X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221830321X)), and those who argued chickens were introduced to South America by Polynesians are contradicted by further DNA evidence showing South Pacific chickens to be wholly different from South American ones ([https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320412111](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320412111)).

It's worth noting the human DNA discovery made huge noises in academic circles interested in the region, and perhaps even more important to remark the study does NOT prove Polynesians reached the Americas any more than South Americans reached Polynesian islands, with some arguing the latter is more likely based on the evidence we currently have.

Lastly, there is the problem of conspiracy theorists frequently presenting South Pacific islands and societies as remnants or successors of ancient advanced civilisation (Lemuria for instance) that has long fallen for their apogee. I mention this particularly because this mythical ancient past often includes contact with other (or the same) ancient advanced civilisations in the Americans (North, Central, and South), with pseudoscientific arguments swearing structures like Nan Madol are linked to Mesoamerican pyramid structures and were built many thousands of years ago before collapse and are proof Lemurian civilisations existed. It is likely the fact lost continent/Lemurian conspiracy theories argue through pseudoscientific proofs that the South Pacific and Americas were linked as part of an advanced civilisation ultimately destroyed in time immemorial as a mainstay of their argument makes it a touchy subject in popular media to discuss inconclusive theories in scientific circle that can easily be interpreted as proof for mega-advanced ancient spiritual mastermind builder civilisations or something of the like."

Super interesting read. Thank you for sharing.

">Most of your audience here is likely not trained to your level, so your thoughts matter. 

Haha let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Basically the whole idea of ""the dark ages"" as this thousand-year-period between ""the fall of Rome"" and ""the Renaissance"" (please excuse all the ""scare quotes"") is something that the academic field has moved beyond. The idea of the fall of Rome has been pretty much supplanted with the concept of late antiquity, a time of transition rather than destruction, as articulated by Peter Brown and Philip Rousseau, and the Renaissance, while a more enduring concept, has also come under fire recently (Joan Kelly's ""Did Women Have a Renaissance?"" is good here). 

As for the middle ages themselves, basically the idea of a dark age isn't a neutral concept, and it's almost always used to contrast a ""new age"" with something earlier and worse. Petrarch gives us the term in the fourteenth century, as part of this triumphalist argument that the lights of Classical antiquity had been lost but were now rediscovered.
Edward Gibbon used the term in much the same way in the eighteenth, to attack an earlier period as part of an argument about his own age. And this is generally how people use this idea of medieval darkness. Historians of early modernity, especially, love contrasting their period with the middle ages in a way that makes the medieval period look backwards and idiotic. (This is a generalization, nothing against early modernists.) So Manchester is just writing in this really long tradition of using the middle ages as a foil for whatever better future tickles the author's fancy; in this case, Magellan and the Renaissance and the birth of modern thought - really, the birth of thought. So basically, what I'm saying is that the dark ages Manchester describes are the result of an agendized series of contrasts between what came before and after, usually with the goal of lauding the birth of modernity after a millenium of darkness.

But it's just not true. The middle ages had vibrant culture and a robust intellectual climate and I have a hard time separating the middle ages of *A World Lit Only by Fire* from the middle ages of *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. I hope that this is helpful."
"""Homeward Bound"" by William Holberton is a great resource about this topic specifically. It deals exclusively with the demobilization of both Confederate and Union armies. I'll quote from it heavily in my response. I'm currently sitting on a plane in Seattle, typing this on my iPhone before I fly home to my family in Alaska, so please excuse any errors I make. 

I used to be flared in this sub-Reddit for the U.S. Civil War, so hopefully that buys me some ""thread credibility."" 

The disbanding of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia was all in all a peaceful process, considering how long the men fought for and how far away from home many of them were. While there were serious concerns about an insurrection after the surrender, R.E. Lee cut a strong figure to his men (as well as Lincoln's firm tone of reconciliation) that upon receiving his order to peacefully disband, Lee did just that. 

I know it might sound strange, but after the men were paroled by Grant and the Union Army they simply melted away into the forest and surrounding roads, towns and hamlets in small groups or on their own, making their way up to 1,500-2,000 miles home. Those who had to trek through the south were particularly hampered because of the thorough job General William Tecumseh Sherman had done in destroying the railroads in his legendary campaign. 

There were cases of small scale looting, but nothing so bad as the potential guerrilla warfare that many citizens feared might transpire after the official surrender of the Confederacy. 

One observer noted of the paroled men, ""As a rule they were tall, thin, spare men with long hair and a beard of a tawney red color. They were all clad in the uniform of Southern grey; nearly all were ragged and dirty...""

According to the terms of surrender, ""each body of soldiers was allowed to hold rifles equal to one-seventh of their numerical strength for protection and hunting along the way home."" There was talk of confiscating horses or mules from those who owned them, but once the idea of how to tend a farm in post-war life was brought up these men who were fortunate enough to own a beast of burden were allowed to keep them. 

An Englishman Francis Lowley observed the surrender at Appomattox and wrote, ""By the evening of the 12th paroles...were distributed, and the disbanded men began to scatter through the country. Hardly one of them had a farthing of money. Some of them had 1,500 to 2,000 miles to travel over a country of which the scanty railroads were utterly annihilated.""

What's important to remember about these men is that this was the dedicated core of what was left of Lee's once mighty Army. At this point, desertions had ticked up after Grant pushed Lee out of Richmond, and had his Union soldiers nipping at Lee's flanks and heels, like a pack of bloodhounds, as they fought predominantly rear guard engagements until reaching Appomattox. 

Point being is that this was one tough contingent of men who were used to fighting for their lives with scant, if any, supply lines. Now that these men were paroled and didn't have the pressure of fighting for their lives each day, it is easier to understand how these men were able to make their way back to their respective homes without having much else besides the clothes on their backs. 

The experiences for travelers differed greatly, depending on rank and distance to home. 

General Lee was given an armed escort for his journey, which wasn't very far since he travelled in Virginia. He was met cordially along the road by his former soldiers, many of them hooting and hollering the rebel yell one last time for their proud commander. It was reported one morning that Lee had an eventful breakfast of ""hard tack, fried pork and black coffee,"" the latter of which being quite rare during the war, as the Union blockade forced many confederate soldiers to find substitutes to traditional coffee, generals and privates alike. 

Yet the travels of some of the rank and file soldiers were much longer indeed. A sergeant from Texas, Valerius C. Giles, had been away for four years and five months. Slowly and ""painfully"" it took him three months to travel back to his home. 

But to me this quote sums it up best: ""A sad procession; some were halt and lame, and some with one arm or one eye. Yet these men, careworn and anxious-looking, and wounded as they may have been were on their way home, and nothing was going to prevent them, however long and circuitous, to that goal."" 

These men were alive. They'd seen their comrades die and their cause vanish. Yet they were still standing. The human spirit, not only in this conflict but in all conflicts around the world, is strong and those who are still breathing will find their way home after the last bullet has flown. And that's exactly what Lee's men did, no matter how long the journey.

">All these things had one trait in common: read a lot, summarize the main ideas, be prepared to argue about those, skip the things which don't matter.

While Duce-related questions usually fall outside of my area, Mussolini actually wrote a whole book in 1913 about the 15th century Bohemian theologian Jan Hus that demonstrates this approach to scholarship. This book, titled *Jan Hus, the Veracious* (*Giovanni Huss il Veridico*, in Italian), was the first monograph about Hus written in Italian. The first five chapters of the book are pretty generic with some scattered commentary. They mostly summarize the previous secondary literature on Jan Hus and the Hussite Reformation, in some instances directly copying whole passages. There are also some inaccuracies and poor translations of the secondary literature. To the best of my knowledge, Mussolini did not read Czech, which might explain some of the issues with the translations-of-translations he is using.

In the sixth and final chapter, Mussolini engaged with the contemporary Catholic intellectual stance toward Hus, and this is where things get really interesting in my opinion. The narrative surrounding the Hussite Reformation aligned well with the views of an Italian anticlericalist and socialist like Mussolini, who clearly had a very high opinion of Jan Hus. The Hussites are frequently depicted in Czech national rhetoric as anti-imperialist nationalists while the religious nature of the movement is often completely ignored. Mussolini handles this in an interesting way by interpreting Jan Hus as a proto-socialist revolutionary whose religion was the socio-political health of the nation.  As an interesting aside, the post-WW2 Czechoslovak communists used a very similar interpretation of the Hussites in their own rhetoric. This is an over simplification but I have to step away for a bit. If anyone has any follow up questions, I can try to answer later. 

While I don't think that *Jan Hus, the Veracious* is an example of serious scholarship, it does reflect /u/Klesk_vs_Xaero's point that Mussolini was good at summarizing ideas from what he read and then synthesized them through his own political lens."
"You should be aware that Gouré's estimates are not considered very reliable these days — he was a Civil Defense ""alarmist"" who believed that the Soviet Civil Defense program was much larger and much more effective than it actually was.

See the Geist citation in my post for a discussion of what we have learned since the Cold War."

I hope that it helps until you receive a more specific answer on the countries you asked about!"
"This is a matter of knowing versus comprehension. It's also a matter of practicality. Yeltsin could have undoubtedly found out the contents of the average American grocery had he cared to. It's doubtful the United States would have exerted much effort to stop him from discovering Pudding Pops or Coca-Cola. But Yeltsin never had any reason to. It was simply never relevant. Do you think Donald Trump or Obama have ever shopped in a Chinese supermarket? Probably not. It's just not relevant to their lives.

Yeltsin also probably had statistics on standards of living available to him. But it's another thing to actually see and experience it. In addition, coming from the Soviet world where statistics were often... dubious if not outright fabricated, he had at least some reason to be suspicious.

Now, onto the context. What is not open for debate: Yeltsin did indeed visit an American grocery store. He had, by all reports, a grand time. He tried some of the wares and the manager gave him some free food to take with him. He inquired about the food distribution system and how managers were chosen. He was deeply affected by this and repeatedly commented on how much better the standards of living in the US were, both to people there and to his aides. Likewise, Yeltsin' assessment that the United States was wealthier and did a better job providing for its people was simply objectively correct. There is some controversy on this point by Soviet apologists, but I'm not aware of any mainstream historian who disagrees. (There are reasons for this other than Communism, but this does not change the standards of living themselves.)

All this is attested to by multiple sources who tell the same broad story with only a few minor contradictions or unverified reports. One aide, for example, recalls Yeltsin planned to open his own chain of grocery stores on this model, and spoke about grocery stores as the fundament of the modern world. While this is not mentioned in other reports, it doesn't really introduce ambiguity into the narrative. It broadly agrees with the other accounts and doesn't contradict them in a meaningful way.

But let's pull back a little. Because this incident didn't come out of nowhere. The Soviet Union and the United States had been competing on the standards of living for decades, going back to the '50s. Before Yeltsin visited the supermarket there were multiple incidents like the Kitchen Debates and other displays where both sides tried to outdo each other in living standards. In reality, the United States was always ahead but the Soviet Union was willing to lie to make it seem otherwise. From time to time, someone would expose this and embarrass the Soviets.

By making a surprise visit and comparing conditions, Yeltsin was acting in a tradition that would have been familiar both at home and in the United States. The surprise was that Yeltsin openly admitted his side wasn't winning. *That* had never happened before.

Why did he do that? Well, he says in part because it was true. And it certainly was true. But, and I have no citation for this, politicians lie. And (I do have a citation for this) the Soviets lied all the time to make themselves look better. Why the reversal?

The pat little story is that Yeltsin saw this grocery store and decided to fight Communism. This has no historical evidence: the reforms began in 1986 (three years before) and Gorbachev explicitly wanted to preserve Communism. Yeltsin was a critic but was not, at the time, explicitly anti-communist. The context was instead of a world where Gorbachev was trying to thaw relations with the United States and reform/revitalize the Soviet Union. He was a reformer doing battle with hardliners at home while trying to keep liberals from tearing the Soviet Union apart. And Yeltsin was a reformer.

By losing one of these 'kitchen debates' (for lack of a better term) he was damaging the conservatives who didn't want to admit the Soviet Union was behind while encouraging his own reformists. It was an attempt to show he was willing to break with previous policy and tradition to force the Soviet system to be examined and reformed. At the same time, hardliners would be put in the awkward position of having to lie without the support of the Soviet government (as a result of Gorbachev's reforms). And without that support, their lies would be much more apparent. It would also warm relations with the west at a time when the Soviet Union was vulnerable (and where Gorbachev was trying to warm the relations).

But none of this answers the more personal question. This is more an explanation of why friendliness to the West fit well into his general program. *Why* did the visit affect him like this? Yeltsin undoubtedly had more power, prestige, and luxuries than anyone else in that store.

In short, because Yeltsin was a Soviet.

It's easy to dismiss people with different belief systems as either secretly believing what we believe or believing in some more base philosophy. For example, saying that Stalin's actions were not *really* about Communism but about power. No one could *really* believe that, could they? Well, usually, yes. They could and did. And Yeltsin's autobiography shows that he really, truly believed in Communism. But he believed it in a specific way: he believed it was *right*, that it was better for the working class. And this was blatant, empirical proof that the United States was beating them in providing for the working class. This is what he tells us himself.

And that genuinely shocked him.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the great response! I've edited a few grammar mistakes."
"> Your counterpoint seems learned, but for our edification, would you elaberate on why, in your experienced opinion, you react so strongly to the term ""hysteria""?

Sure. It is because in the early 1980s, it became a common ""talking point"" to dismiss Civil Defense (and poor old Bert the Turtle, who was ""resurrected"" primarily to be made fun of) as a ""hysterical reaction"" by Americans in the 1950s. It was part of an anti-nuclear argument (and anti-Reagan argument) of its time, and is in many ways a deliberate, snide reading of the past. It has led many Americans to dismiss Cold War fears as being silly, overblown, etc. They were not. It is also part of a semi-conspiracy theory that Civil Defense was just meant to ""deceive"" people and make them complacent — there is no evidence that anyone involved with producing CD materials ever thought anything like this. It is true that the American CD efforts were underfunded and inadequate given the scope of the possible effects, and it is true that many of them were ""framed"" in ways that are easy to read as misleading, and it is true that nuclear war would be a terrible thing with or without Civil Defense (though there are different levels of ""terrible""). But to smugly dismiss it — often with very unjustified and dare-I-say ignorant assertions (""how could a school desk save someone from an atomic bomb?"") — is a bad reading of the past and often masks a bad reading of nuclear history.

The Cold War _was_ a very dangerous period. The fact that we survived it mostly intact (depends who ""we"" is in this context, of course, because many people _did_ die during the Cold War, and many _millions_ (!!!) of civilians perished in the proxy war struggles in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, etc.) should not be an excuse to snigger at the fact that many people correctly intuited at the time that it was extremely dangerous. In the early 1990s, the newly-appointed head of the Strategic Air Command reviewed US nuclear war plans and concluded that ""we escaped the Cold War without a nuclear holocaust by some combination of skill, luck, and divine intervention, and I suspect the latter in greatest proportion."" Most people that I have talked to, in the US anyway, are unaware how close we came — multiple times — to a full-scale nuclear exchange. It is very easy to imagine possible outcomes that were much more worse than what actually happened, and what actually happened was bad enough as it was (debilitating and destabilizing military arms races, interventions globally, etc. — practically _all_ of our present-day international concerns have, to one degree or another, their roots in Cold War policies by various nations).

""Hysteria"" implies _exaggerated_ emotional excitement. I don't think fear of nuclear holocaust during the Cold War was exaggerated. I don't see evidence of people running around irrationally. I see a lot of very real, relatable people trying to grasp what kind of world they live in. And in general, I try to take my historical actors seriously. It is easy to laugh at people's fears once they appear to be proven ""ill founded."" It is harder to take them seriously. "
"That is extremely interesting, I hadn't realized that so much variation was present in these communities; I assumed that the divide was more or less as simple as ""Amish vs Mennonite""."
"Your observation about the depiction of western towns - and the question about food sources - is very well placed. The West (particularly the arid West) has consistently been one of most urbanized regions of North America, and the towns are often is the least likely of locations with no obvious natural resources. Mineral resources are too often found in the most bleak of circumstances!

Various sources demonstrate that many people in these towns kept chickens, and sometimes they kept other animals used for food, but this was hardly sufficient to support a large community. In addition, a large community quickly exhausted natural food resources in the vicinity.

If we reach back further in time, we can see the California Gold Country following the rush of 1849, and it is easy to understand how the then-smaller communities survived: California has ample opportunities for agriculture and the style of mining was not conducive to large communities. Placer mining pursues extensive mineral resources that are pursued by small groups of people. While co-editing the [the Grosh letters](https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Allen-Shepperson-Nevada-History/dp/1943859019) (published in 2012) written from 1849 to 1857, it was clear that small parties of gold miners pursued their retrieval of gold, but usually one or more of the small group went hunting daily. This was usually done by men who had a good reputation for hunting. They were compensated with an equal share of gold retrieved. With gold in hand, someone was regularly sent to the nearest town to buy other supplies. That model was easily developed and implemented with very little infrastructure.

A crisis occurred in the West in 1859 with the discoveries of various underground gold and silver deposits in the West, remotely located and often in places where no sensible person would settle for lack of food and water. These were ""intensive"" deposits - veins of mineral resources - that required large underground operations, a switch from the earlier placer mining days. 

Establishing how to address this situation, Virginia City and the great Comstock Lode became the internationally accepted model on how to build and support a large mining community in a remote location (again, see my book, [The Roar and the Silence: A History of Virginia City and the Comstock Lode](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008BUSNQ4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) (1998)). As was often the case, this sort of community required the importation of everything from food, lumber, clothing, tools, and even water. This represented a considerable challenge, requiring the building of roads (and eventually a railroad) and a network of importers. Because of this, mining towns/cities of the arid Intermountain West often had better connections with the international marketplace than rural Midwestern agrarian communities. Archaeologically, one finds evidence of products from throughout the world: see my book [Virginia City: Secrets of a Western Past](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0803238487/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i12) (2012), which describes over two decades of archaeological investigations of the Virginia City National Historic Landmark District.

To augment what was imported, there was typically a network of ranches, farms, fisheries, etc., that consumed resources for dozens and then hundreds of miles around. This often resulted in the destruction of natural habitats and caused enormous suffering among Native American populations: see Eugene Hattori's excellent essay of Native American adaptation to the Comstock Mining District in my co-edited volume [Comstock Women: The Making of a Mining Community](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M8G80NJ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i6) (1998).

In the case of Virginia City, there was a large feedlot where cattle were kept (brought in from ranches hundreds of miles around) for regular slaughtering for local markets and restaurants. There was also a well-watered nearby community - American Flat - where farmers raised vegetables for Virginia City. Northern Paiutes at Pyramid Lake operated fisheries that provided additional resources. Many others contributed to this process of gathering and farming for resources for the mining town's markets and restaurants.

While many of the pinyon pine groves were destroyed for firewood in the first two winters (causing further deprivation for Native Americans), those living in the towns quickly developed an appetite for pinyon pine nuts, and the destruction began to decline. With some irony, Native American harvesters often sold the nuts to the city dwellers, because cash became more valuable to them than nuts. Mark Twain - who took his name in Virginia City in 1863 - was known to write friends asking for pinyon pine nuts!

That digression aside, the supply network became expansive, and this approach - written up in mining journals of the day - was imitated internationally. It was an expensive approach (Virginia City's water was piped in over seventeen miles away, for example). The network of roads alone was extensive, and experimentation included using camels to haul supplies (the experiment failed).

One could go on! Feel free to ask questions!

"There being mud on Elizabeth Bennet's dress is from canon. However:

a) The dress she would have been wearing in line with the 1813 publication date would not have been so long. By 1813, English women only wore trains, when they even did, in fashionable evening dress; the fashionable morning skirt length was at roughly the ankle. Mrs. Hurst says, ""Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office."" That's halfway up her calf! As she walked through this really deep mud, Elizabeth held up her gown's hem to protect it, and then dropped it once she got to Netherfield Park so that the dirty petticoat (which could be boiled clean) wouldn't be seen.

b) This is as much about characterization as it is reality. Elizabeth is the kind of person who will walk miles through mud while doing only the bare minimum to protect her clothing (imagine what her shoes look like). Louisa Hurst and Caroline Bingley are fashionable London ladies who absolutely would only make that trip by carriage, even if the road were dry, and probably wouldn't do it at all."
"You've focused heavily on polygamy, but weren't there other reasons people had for being skeptical of mormons? I am from Ohio, so I'm particularly familiar with the failed bank that they ran in Kirtland, which they used to defraud locals out of a bunch of money before essentially being run out of town.

Basically, polygamy was certainly part of it, but the early mormon church had quite the reputation for being less than scrupulous in other respects as well, didn't they?

EDIT: Also, the language you use to describe the unprovoked massacre of 120 people is pretty mild. That event cemented the reputation of mormons as violent religious extremists, and it wasn't really undeserved. To gloss over that the way you did as something that merely made them look ""bizarre"" is kind of troubling.

"I'm happy to discuss that! It's truly, deeply, fascinating.  

So the American Revolution really has two stories. What were the common people doing (the 99%ers as we would call them today) and the elite.  Now, I will also preface this with, there was not as much of a class struggle then as one might argue now. 

As most high school students learn, the American Revolution's origins were rooted in the economic and political fallout following the end of the French and Indian War.  Some factors affected affected lower-class people at a much more prevalent rate than the elite.  For instance, the [Proclamation Line of 1763](http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/proclamation-line-of-1763/), which was a border along the western United States, prohibited American colonists from settling on lands that they gained from the French during war, in order to make good on their treaties with Native Americans. While the line failed to halt many people expanding westward, the British still occupied forts during the 1760s with the sole purpose of pushing colonists back, sometimes by force.  This fueled tensions for poor farmers who were looking to make a living off of land that they wouldn't have to rent from someone.  While the line was largely ignored by poor farmers, it did halt some of the expansion from wealthy land speculators (including famous folks like George Washington) from trying to seize land that they planned on selling later at a steep price. Both groups of people were angered over this line.

Taxes, of course, were a matter that affected mostly everyone in America. A series of taxes were imposed on American colonists throughout the 1760s that down-right outraged most lower-class Americans.  This was especially true for Colonists living in New England. Some, like the [Stamp Act](http://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/stamp-act) never actually got off the ground due to intense pushback from the colonists, forcing Parliament to rescind it not even a year after it was announced.  Royal governors feared the masses, not the gentry when they spoke about the protests.  Check out this account where  the Governor of Massachusetts was talking about the protests of the stamp act.  Here, he's fearful not of the wealthy, but of the poor, and in particular, afraid of what may happen if the rich stopped supporting the government.  If ""persons of property and consideration did not unit in support of government"" it would lead to ""an insurrection of the poor.""(Bernard Bailyn *The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson* pp 37).  In my personal research, I even came across letters of Maryland's [Charles Carroll](https://www.biography.com/people/charles-carroll-21262233), signer of the Declaration of Independence, whom, in 1765, exchanged letters with his father condemning the masses for being too harsh in their reactions to the British crown. I have copies of the letters at home and can transcribe them tonight if you are interested, but the general gist was him being concerned that these lower-class 'peasants' did not realize that there could be real consequences for angering the British crown.  His views of course would change when, a decade later, he voted in favor of breaking off from Great Britain. 

Now, to be clear, in 1765, when this letter was written, the gentry were not on board yet and many attitudes would be at odds with later actions.  Heck, several founders still were very weary of even the concept of democracy being a positive thing yet.  John Adams said, just [two years prior in a letter](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-01-02-0045-0008):

>  ... Democracy, will soon degenerate into an Anarchy, such an Anarchy that every Man will do what is right in his own Eyes, and no Mans life or Property or Reputation or Liberty will be secure and every one of these will soon mould itself into a system of subordination of all the moral Virtues, and Intellectual Abilities, all the Powers of Wealth, Beauty, Wit, and Science, to the wanton Pleasures, the capricious Will, and the execrable Cruelty of one or a very few.

My point for referencing this is that, attitudes eventually changed and it took the elite a little more time to get on board. 

The series of taxes that followed, known today as the [Intolerable Acts](https://www.britannica.com/event/Intolerable-Acts)  were met with similar hostility and outcry.  While members of the American Gentry fueled the fires, it was the American masses that took to the streets during this period.  A really great breakdown of these events are in the book I cited above by Alan Taylor, *American Revolutions*.  Here, it's very apparent that the Revolution was a populist movement that was fueled by the elite. In Massachusetts, merchants, soon to be political figures like John Handcock, were outraged about the British's new policies, both in terms of taxation and their new enforcement of mercantilism that really put a strain on his shipping/smuggling business.

"How much truth is there to the arguments that uniform diversity was partially a product of regular military discipline breaking down due to bitterness over the war itself or that the ""best"" troops were stationed in Europe in case of direct Soviet invasion?"
"not the OP, but most of the larger western towns - the places that tend to be where western films were set - were likely to be places with a single primary economic production. That could mean mines, like gold mines in the Black Hills, like Deadwood, but it could also mean ""cow towns"" like Abilene or Dodge City, Kansas. Their prominence was due to the access they afforded cattle ranchers to the ""railhead"" that led back east, to where meatpackers would process the cattle.

The last sort of prominent fixture of towns, especially in the Great Plains, was along coach roads like the Santa Fe or Oregon Trails, and eventually the railroad right of way. These towns were generally established to protect and support westward travelers, or to service the railroad. Because their role was dependent on the travel route, they were also likely to be supported mostly by importing foodstuffs and finished goods."
This was a great write up. Thank you so much
"""He \[Montaigne\] fully believed that an ancient Roman, could one be brought back, would not be able to recognize \[the city of Rome\]. It has more than once happened that, after digging a long way down, the workmen have come to the top of some high column, which still remained standing on its base far beneath. The modern architects never think of looking for any other foundation for their houses than the tops of old buildings, the roofs of which ordinarily form the floors of modern cellars....There are many whole streets, that stand above the old ones, full thirty feet.""

Montaigne may have exaggerated a bit about sixteenth-century builders sticking houses on top of Roman roofs. But it is undeniably true that ancient Rome was - and largely still is - buried by up to forty feet of deposited earth and debris. The progress of the burial can be seen on the [facade of the Curia](https://www.livius.org/pictures/italy/rome/rome-forum-romanum/rome-forum-curia-julia/curia-julia-facade/) (Senate House) in the Roman Forum. Beside the original entrance are slots cut into the walls for medieval burials - at first only a few feet over the ancient pavement, and then a full eight or ten feet above it. By the eleventh century, the ancient (and modern) door had been filled, and a new one cut into the wall ten feet higher. This entrance served until the seventeenth century, when the progressive rise of the streets around forced the creation of another door, ten feet above the medieval one, on the level of the ancient clerestory windows. 

How did Rome - or any ancient city - come to be buried so deep? If a city remains in use, rubbish thrown onto the streets and piled in alleys has a way of building up. Natural processes - windblown dust, the slow growth and decay of vegetation - also played a real but relatively modest part. If you look at a modern building that's been abandoned for a few decades, you can already see plants growing from every convenient crevice (take, for example, [the roof of Detroit's famous Packard Plant](https://www.alamy.com/detroit-michigan-a-forest-of-trees-grows-on-the-roof-of-the-old-packard-plant-opened-in-1903-the-35-million-square-foot-plant-employed-40000-wo-image248910273.html)). Early modern representations of Rome's ruins show [similar rooftop forests](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/363894). In a temperate climate like Rome's (or Detroit's), the soil produced by the lives and deaths of these urban jungles accretes slowly but steadily - under particularly favorable conditions, perhaps an inch every century.

Most ancient cities, however, are buried primarily by their own rubble. Take a conventional Roman apartment building, three or four stories high. The exterior walls of the first couple stories are likely to be brick-faced concrete. But the rest - the upper stories, roof, partitions, floors, etc. - is wood. Abandon the building, and let it decay. The wood rots fairly quickly; within a century, the floors and roof have collapsed inward, creating a waist-deep heap inside the masonry shell. Add another century or so, and the slow reducing action of rain and frost will pulverize the mortar of the masonry walls. An earthquake or two brings the walls down, and our erstwhile apartment building is soon a grass-grown mound, six or eight feet high.

There were, of course, more dramatic processes of burial. Sometimes, buildings were deliberately covered to make foundations for new structures; parts of Nero's Golden House were preserved this wall. (So, fifteen hundred miles away, were the famous church and synagogue of Dura-Europos, covered and conserved by an artificial siege rampart.) Floods - to which the Tiber was lamentably prone until the construction of the modern embankments - left deposits of silt. And occasionally, earthquake-induced landslides covered buildings like the Church of Santa Maria Antiqua in several stories of mud. 

Every ancient city, of course, is different. Some are buried deeper than Rome: Sardis (now in western Turkey) is up to sixty feet deep, thanks to millennia of earth being washed down from its citadel. Cities in arid desert environments, by contrast, are often hardly buried at all: despite a millennium or more of abandonment, Syria's ""dead cities"" are still more or less at surface level - and [very well-preserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Cities#/media/File:Serjilla_01.jpg). How deep a city is buried will depend on a whole host of factors, ranging from the local climate to the construction of the buildings to the later history of the site. Troy / Ilion, for example, was buried so deep largely because the site was reused more or less constantly for the better part of three millennia; every time an earthquake or sack devastated the settlement, the ruins were knocked flat and a new city rose on the rubble. Schliemann had to hack through forty feet of superimposed cityscapes to reach the Early Bronze age levels where he found his gold. 

For the second part of your question, let's return - as I am always happy to do - to Rome. More particularly, let's watch the Roman Forum's transformation from monumental center to cow pasture. In late antiquity, the Forum looked much [as it had during the mid-imperial era](https://www.teggelaar.com/rome/images/imagesub/imrome/R3543.jpg): a monumental plaza bounded by imposing basilicas and temples. By the early fifth century, the temples had ceased to be used for worship, though they were preserved from pillage by imperial decree and imperial respect for the monuments of the ancient capital. Alaric's sack of Rome (410) destroyed one of the great basilicas beside the Forum square (if you visit today, you can still see clumps of coins melted into the marble pavement). The building was never repaired, though its elaborate portico continued to house shops. From the early sixth century onward, small churches sprouted along the Forum's edge, and makeshift houses were built into some of the marble porticoes. Besides the old Curia- which had been converted into a church - the buildings around the Forum became increasingly decrepit and dangerous. By the year 800 or so, when the author of the Einsiedeln Itinerary passed through, the Forum was still recognizable, though surrounded by half-collapsed buildings. Two serious earthquakes in the early ninth century, however, seem to have brought down most of the tottering ruins, covering the old Forum square with a blanket of rubble. After this, there was no attempt to reestablish the Forum as a monumental space, and the Forum soon became the [grass-grown field](https://art.thewalters.org/detail/24230/view-of-the-roman-forum/) it would remain until the excavations of the nineteenth century.

As for settlement patterns, Rome's diminished medieval population is often said to have concentrated in ancient Campus Martius - i.e., the bend of the Tiber opposite the Vatican. This was certainly the area of heaviest settlement, but there were scattered pockets elsewhere, including a thriving neighborhood in the Colosseum itself. Many people apparently lived in the lower stories of the more solid apartment blocks; the Roman insula on the slopes of the Capitoline, for example, shows many layers of medieval re-use (including a small church in the top floor - [note the bell tower](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ara_Coeli_Insula#/media/File:Insula_Romana_-_panoramio.jpg)). A few of the ancient mansions of the late antique aristocracy were apparently still inhabited through at least the ninth century (the Einsiedeln pilgrim mentions ""palaces""). Others, like the house of Gregory the Great, [survived as monasteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gregorio_Magno_al_Celio#/media/File:San_Gregorio_al_Celio_(Rome).jpg). 

This post feels overlong, so let's summarize and be done: ancient cities are usually buried by their own rubble. How quickly and how deeply that rubble accumulates depends on the nature of the buildings and later reuse.

I go into more detail on early medieval Rome in [this page on Rome's most impressive ninth-century church](https://toldinstone.com/santa-prassede/)."
"There's a quite detailed paper by Thomas Musgrave in the *Macquarie Law Journal* from 2003 which goes into some detail on this ([and which is freely available on the web](https://www.mq.edu.au/public/download/?id=16258)). 

To pretty briefly summarise that paper, Western Australia's presence in the Australian federation is to some extent an accident of history. If there hadn't been a gold rush in the 1890s which brought in a large amount of people from the other colonies (who ended up voting in the 1900 referendum on whether to join), Western Australia would likely not have joined the federation. Previous to the gold rush, Western Australia had done well out of exports to the other colonies (for which the state charged tariffs), and those tariffs were phased out under federation. Further, federal tariffs on agricultural products, once Western Australia had signed up, harmed the predominantly agrarian Western Australian economy in comparison to the more industrialised East. 

The perception that Western Australia getting a bum rap from the Federal government - [echoes of which are still around today](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/sep/05/waxit-beware-independence-western-australia-a-la-brexit-makes-no-sense) - culminated in a referendum of Western Australian voters in 1933, in which around two-thirds of the Western Australian public voted for secession. This was put to the British parliament, who said it could only lawfully happen with a referendum of all the other states on the matter - which never happened."

"Even before that in the Battle of Omdurman (1898, British Empire 10,000 - 48 Sudan, away win), the power of the machine gun was fully demonstrated by the British army. The main issue was that most of the machine gun work was done by colonial troops, which was generally considered a less prestigious posting for the dregs of the military. On the other hand, the branch that had the most to lose with the advent of the machine gun, the cavalry, was considered the most prestigious, the noblest and bore many high ranking officer (BEF commander French, and the two Russian generals Samsonov and von Rennenkampf were all cavalrymen). Therefore, the learnings for the Russo-Japanese War was mostly dismissed as mad or inconclusive. 

>""In the Russo-Japanese War an English observer, the future General Sir Ian Hamilton, reported that the only thing the cavalry could do in the face of entrenched machine guns was to cook rice for the infantry, causing the War Office to wonder if his months in the Orient had not affected his mind. When Germany's observer in the same war, the future General Max Hoffmann, reported a similar conclusion about the defensive power of the entrenched machine guns, Moltke was inspired to comment, 'There never was such a crazy way of making war!'""

- Tuckman, Barbara W. (1962) The Guns of August, pg 189

The Germans were slightly less affected by this institutional malice because a) they had insignificant number of colonials, b) they had a more robust military culture that wasn't ingrained in tradition as the British and French were, and c) the Kaiser Wilhelm II loved Maxim guns, which meant the Germans went to war with significantly more and slightly better understanding of their Maxim guns. The allied powers soon caught up after the initial shock, however. "

"Evans points out that by the 1930s, many doctors in Germany had developed beliefs in ""racial hygiene"" as an extension of the hygienic movement that emphasized sterile operating environments, cleanliness and antiseptic techniques in medicine.

The idea of racial hygiene, supported by the Nazis (and many in other conservative German parties), was that ""the best way to reduce the impossible burden of welfare on the economy was to prevent the underclass from reproducing, by subjecting them to forcible sterilization. Before many years had passed, there would thus be fewer indigent families to support. Before long, too, the numbers of alcoholics, ‘work-shy’, mentally handicapped, criminally inclined and physically disabled people in Germany would be drastically reduced - on the dubious assumption, of course, that all these conditions were overwhelmingly hereditary in nature - and the welfare state would be able to direct its dwindling resources on the deserving poor,"" Evans writes.

These attitudes garnered most of their support among Protestants, while Catholics strongly opposed them."
"Mormons were definitely demonized at the time. A Study in Scarlet (1887), the first Holmes story, was first published in the Strand Magazine. It was one of dozens of novels in this time period that depicted Mormons as predatory villains trying to trap virtuous young women into polygamy. These ""dime novels"" were almost never particularly accurate, but they did reflect a real sense at the time that Mormons were degraded, lustful fiends.

Let me back up just a bit and define ""Mormons."" We're talking here about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah. There were other ""Mormon"" churches that traced their roots to Joseph Smith, including groups in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and the largest branch after the LDS Church, the Reorganized Church in Missouri. Smith founded the church in 1830, and after his assassination in 1844 in Illinois, several splits occurred over the next several years that led to multiple groups claiming to be the one true successor to Smith.

The Reorganized Church in particular went to great lengths to distance itself from the Utah church and denounce polygamy. They taught for many years (erroneously) that Joseph Smith never practiced polygamy and did not introduce it to the church, but that it was Smith's LDS successor Brigham Young who started it all. Smith did practice polygamy, but did so secretly, and so it wasn't until 1852 when the LDS Church announced to the world that it believed in polygamy.

Like many groups that have an unusual belief or practice that is maligned for the practice, the LDS Church dug in its heels on polygamy. Leaders began to preach that polygamy was not only an acceptable practice, but was superior to monogamy. They taught that in order to achieve full exaltation in the highest kingdom of heaven, one must be a polygamist. Utah was isolated in the American West—the Mormons settled it in 1847, but the transcontinental railroad wasn't completed until 1869. Rumors from federal appointees would make their way east into newspapers about how Brigham Young, who was territorial governor, was running a theocracy in Utah (he basically was).

In 1857, Mormons in southern Utah massacred an immigrant train of around 120 men, women, and children from Arkansas at a place that was called the Mountain Meadows. This Mountain Meadows Massacre was quickly reported in newspapers across the country. The act only further isolated the Mormons from the country and reinforced the view of them as a strange, bizarre people.

Cartoonists lampooned Brigham Young and the Mormons as oddities. Popular images showed Young in bed for dozens of women. They portrayed Mormons as menacing. After the Civil War, more attention was paid to the church and the federal government began to intervene. They passed anti-polygamy legislation, and they passed legislation restricting emigration of Mormon converts from Europe.

It's against all this backdrop that we get the appearance of these dime novels portraying Mormon men—especially Mormon missionaries—as predators. They often depict an innocent, naive young woman who falls under the Mormon man's spell. She is kidnapped or coerced into traveling to Utah. She must be rescued by a daring suitor or some other hero.

One of my favorites, for those of you familiar at all with Salt Lake City, has a climactic chase where the kidnapped woman climbs to the tallest spire of the Salt Lake Temple and leaps into the Great Salt Lake to escape her captors. The Great Salt Lake is at minimum 15 miles from the Salt Lake Temple. But none of that mattered to readers who had never been to Salt Lake and of course, given what they had heard, had no intention of going.

These dime novels were popular and most were of poor quality, but ""A Study in Scarlet"" stands out. Most people who dive into Sherlock Holmes and decide to read them in chronological order of publication are surprised to discover that the world's most famous detective, and one of the world's most famous fictional characters ever, got his start in an anti-Mormon dime novel.

The first half of the novel includes Holmes tracking down a killer, but the second half is dedicated to the Latter-day Saints in Utah (again, this surprises first-time readers), who come across a man and a girl in the desert and rescue them. The man and girl live in Utah, but when the girl comes of age, she is expected to become the plural wife of one of the sons of a prominent Mormon leader. They give her thirty days. But she has a suitor who intervenes to rescue her. I won't spoil the mystery or the story for those who would like to read it, but it's something else.

How accurate were these dime novels? They weren't. Apart from the many details they often invented or got wrong, they portrayed Mormons in a way that wasn't particularly fair to who they really were. Polygamy was not the utopia Mormons portrayed, of course. Men played favorites with their wives, and some women lived in different homes than their husbands, had little money, and lived in poverty. But on the flip side, women in Utah were granted the right to vote in 1870, long before nearly any other state in the Union. It was all, to say the least, complicated.

Dissenters and non-Mormons did live in Utah. They had plenty of complaints about LDS domination of politics and business, but by and large, they lived peacefully. In 1870, the ""Salt Lake Tribune"" was founded, which stood in stark opposition to Young and LDS publications. It provided an outlet and news for non-Mormons.

As the federal government continued to crack down on polygamy, things became intolerable for the church. The Edmunds-Tucker Act (1887) was the last straw. The government threatened to seize church property, including temples. It had already disenfranchised polygamists and states like Idaho had implemented test oaths for anyone wanting to vote or run for public office. In 1890, the Woodruff Manifesto announced that Mormons would no longer enter into new plural marriages.

But the church continued to approve some plural marriages in secret. Rumors continued about these marriages and Mormons continued to be lampooned in the media. The advent of motion pictures allowed for a new kind of dime novel—the anti-Mormon movie. Films like ""A Mormon Maid"" (1917) and ""A Victim of the Mormons"" (1911) followed the basic plotline of the earlier dime novels. They portrayed Mormons wearing strange robes and clothing and trapping women into unwanted polygamous marriages.

But by then the church had truly abandoned polygamy with the second manifesto in 1904. Apostle Reed Smoot had been elected to the US Senate, and lengthy hearings were held in Washington, DC, to see if he should be granted his seat. Mormon church president Joseph F. Smith testified before Congress, albeit at times not very truthfully, about the continued practice of polygamy. Because of the attention paid to the church, Smith issued the manifesto and banned all future plural marriages.

I've covered a lot of ground, but for some good overviews of this, I recommend Sarah Barringer Gordon, \_The Mormon Question: Polygamy and Constitutional Conflict in Nineteenth-Century America\_ (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002); Kathleen Flake, \_The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot, Mormon Apostle\_ (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004); Michael Austin and Ardis Parshall, \_Dime Novel Mormons\_ (Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2017); and for portrayals of Mormons as savages and ""other,"" see W. Paul Reeve, \_Religion of a Different Color: Race and the Mormon Struggle for Whiteness\_ (New York: Oxford University Press, 2017).

Edit: A few commenters have called out my language in describing the Mountain Meadows Massacre as something that made Americans see Mormons as odd and ""strange."" It's a fair criticism and I wasn't trying to minimize the horrific nature of the massacre; rather, I was trying to explain that Mormons were already viewed as a bizarre religious cult. There were rumors around ""Danites""—Mormon assassins who would execute dissidents or those who tried to leave the faith.

The massacre itself was, if possible, worse than it sounds. After a siege, Mormons separated the men from the women and children, had the women and children march a ways down a trail, and then they killed both groups. Later, Mormons tried to blame the massacre on Paiutes. While there were some Paiutes involved, the massacre was wholly the result of southern Utah Mormons surrounding the wagon train and then deciding to exterminate everyone except a handful of extremely young children—infants and toddlers, essentially. I'd recommend reading Juanita Brooks or Will Bagley on the massacre. Though I'm not persuaded by Bagley's assertions on Brigham Young, he is a brilliant researcher and writer, and a dear friend.

This thread shows how contested Mormon history is. I've already been asked if I'm LDS because my answer is perceived as too biased in favor of the Mormons. I'm not LDS, but I'm very used to the skepticism. Although Mormon studies is becoming more and more professionalized as an academic practice, it frequently inspires a very binary response. Latter-day Saints want to know, ""Is this person for us or against us?"" Conversely, those who have left the faith are, if possible, even more intense and skeptical—at least in my experience.

My use of terms like ""complicated"" and ""messy"" isn't an effort to whitewash or somehow defend the LDS Church, but it's to acknowledge that these things \*are\* messy and complicated. Even here on Reddit, which allows for much broader discussion than say, Facebook or Twitter, there are still limitations. I'd encourage anyone interested in a particular topic to PM and I'm happy to offer additional reading."

"*I wrote this as a response to a post about the atlatl which was deleted.*

One thing to consider is why you would consider ""stories of individual archers accomplishing such feats"" as not fitting into the idea of a ""sniper"" given the way that that role arguably orientates itself towards individual feats of marksmanship (though over the course of the twentieth century it has increasingly become a paired role).

I'd argue that there's something to the idea that individual skill at marksmanship was a defining feature of the martial capacity of many less industrial/agricultural societies. The origin of the term itself is with the hunting of ""snipes"", a bird in the Indian subcontinent. A society that valued hunting often values marksmanship, and the flattened structure of such societies would in turn mean that disputes would often be understood in terms of individual antipathies (which would lead to the targeting of leaders) and asymetrical warfare over set-piece battles.

An example of this is the widespread use of a weapon commonly known elsewhere as the atlatl, amongst Aboriginal peoples in Australia. This was commonly used and in the Dharug language it was known as a ""woomera"": a long shaped piece of wood, ending in a hook, and sometimes doubling as a shield. One of the first representations of Aboriginal people shown in Europe has a warrior holding one (though through reproduction the artist represents it as a sort of club rather than a spear thrower).

I have personally seen a man from the Central Desert use one to great affect at what seemed like an extremely long distance, and they were widely used in resistance to European expansion from early on. The first Governor of the colony, Governor Arthur Phillip, was speared with one. David Collins description of that incident shows some of the skill with which it was deployed:

""(Willemering) …lifted a spear from the grass with his foot, and fixing it on his throwing-stick, in an instant darted it at the governor. The spear entered a little above the collar bone, and had been discharged with such force that the barb of it came through on the other side.""

This incident apparently did not occur at range, but I recall at least one account lamenting the incapacity of muskets in comparison to the speed and accuracy of a skilled warrior using a woomera (a skill used not only in battle but also hunting animals like Kangaroos, which are not easy game).

So in this respect I guess it depends on how you define a ""sniper"". The resistance to the European invasion of Australia did not involve large set piece battles, but the spearing of Phillip shows that there were warriors who directly targeted colonial leadership (even if in this case the attack was likely retaliatory and ""ritualistic"", as being speared was a customary punishment for a range of breaches of communal norms, I recommend Inga Clendinnen's ""Dances with Strangers"" and Grace Karskens ""the Colony"" as starting points on this incident if anyone is interested).

So it's not quite an example of what the OP is asking about: ""purpose-built military archery units"", but it *is* an example of the tactical deployment of individual marksmanship skills in pursuit of strategic goals (targeting leadership, sowing terror etc.), which I'd argue is as good a definition of ""sniping""."

"There were two things we might call ""loopholes"".

The first was that Prohibition (more specifically, the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act) meant that, for most purposes, alcoholic beverages could not be legally manufactured in the U.S. Nor could they be imported. Nor transported. Nor sold. *However*, they could be possessed and consumed. Strictly speaking, keeping an alcohol stash in the Whitehouse, and drinking it, were not violations of federal law.

The second involves that ""most purposes"" above. The manufacture of alcohol was not entirely illegal. It was allowed for scientific research, for use in various industrial processes, for religious rituals, and for medicine. Harding got his supply through that last category. One Jesse Smith, a friend of the then attorney general, had a permit that allowed him to obtain alcohol legally under the medical-use exemption. And Smith was able, and willing, to pass alcohol to Harding.

So Smith could legally obtain alcohol, and Harding could legally possess it, drink it, and share it with his friends. I doubt that the law would have smiled on Smith supplying his medical-exemption alcohol to Harding. But -- sometimes law enforcement doesn't know what is happening, and sometimes they do know, but choose to overlook."

Roughly the same time, there were some excavations on a different
site of the Tigris that had six sealed jars, each with different contents:

1. ten rolled up bronze cylinders, sealed, containing decomposed papyrus,
described by Upton at the time as ""probably exorcisms or blessings"" ([picture here](https://imgur.com/a/ETO3hCl))

2. three bronze rolls

3. three bronze sealed rolls

4. one bronze roll, where the jar and roll were sealed with bitumen (asphalt),
and there were traces of tin, iron, and lead

5. a jar with ""bitumen stoppers"" some corroded ""earthy substance"" that appeared to be lead.

6. A jar with ten corroded iron nails, previously wrapped with
an organic material. ([picture here](https://imgur.com/a/e6Q1mYf))

All were dated to the 5th-6th century.

Another find from 1936 was a sealed ceramic vessel, 15 cm high, with
an asphalt stopper. Inside there was both a copper cylinder closed on one end
with a copper plate (soldered with a lead/tin alloy) and an iron spike
held by an asphalt stopper. The spike came out roughly a centimeter from the
top. 

It supposedly was dated from the 2nd century CE (although the design suggests it was
actually from the same time as the other finds; the provenance was unfortunately not
well documented).

Its discovery was announced by the Austrian archaeologist König, where, due to some acidic material inside, he theorized it was used for electroplating, and after became known as the Baghdad Battery.

I first want to be clear that while ""acidic material"" led people
to theorize it was filled with vinegar or the like, it does not necessarily
mean such. Just like with Egyptian mummies could test positive for nicotine
by eating celery or eggplant ([and not smoking nicotine from another continent](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/nvj04f/is_there_a_working_theory_for_how_ancient/h1476k4/)), acidic substances can come from multiple sources, like any organic material that is acidic.

Issue #1: the concrete stopper is a complete seal. The iron spike pokes out but not the copper. There is no method for the battery to have a ""connection"". Any alleged replicas have to modify the device to account for this.

Issue #2: the residue is not what'd we expect. If it was
actually a battery, what we'd expect to have a significant
residue of copper salts.

Issue #3: the device would need to be refilled regularly to work, but it was designed as sealed.

While the _exact_ configuration of this particular device is unique, it _strongly_
resembles the other finds in basic form, some which definitively had papyrus.

The procedure appears to have been:

1. take a sacred scroll (""exorcisms or blessings"")

2. wrap it around a rod, it could be iron or bronze

3. put it in a copper tube or glass flask

4. then put this inside a plugged clay jar to be protected from decay.

The only thing suspicious about the supposed battery is that the iron spike pokes out; the one
with iron nails is large enough to contain them without such a design. However, again, there is
no practical way for there to be a battery, and the matching jars found in the same region clearly
don't resemble batteries at all.

"There was no specific planning for or against the patination of the copper. No measures were taken to either encourage or discourage the natural process. The copper skin of the statue is actually a fairly thin layer, about the thickness of two pennies, and it was left more or less untouched for the first hundred years or so of the statue's existence. Any effort to remove the patina would have disturbed the protective oxidation layer and eventually led the the thin copper sheets weathering away. The original copper did deteriorate over the years from water making its way into the statue and collecting in low points. This damage meant that several parts were so severely damaged that they needed to be replaced by the 1980s. The tip of her nose, the end of a hair curl, and the entire torch were replaced in a massive repair effort from 1984-1986.

Prior to that, there were various attempts over the years to seal the copper of the statue from the inside. These various efforts created a buildup of a variety of coatings, including bituminous sealants and many layers of paint. These remained intact until they were all removed during the 1980s restoration using a mixture of solvents and liquid nitrogen. As a result, the inside of the statue is now just the bare copper with the exception of the inside of her head, where the crown observation platform is. That area is painted because of ongoing vandalism concerns. It is repainted once a year on Christmas Eve to allow time for the paint to dry over Christmas Day, because that is the one day each year that the statue is closed.

The statue's skin does have many holes. Some are from missing rivets, some from water damage, and some others are intentional, to allow water to drain out and prevent it from collecting in low points. The holes are mostly small, but on bright days you can certainly see pinpricks of light coming into the statue, particularly as she narrows toward her shoulders and head.

All of this is not to say that people did not take notice of the greening of the statue and occasionally advocate for it to be ""restored,"" presumably by polishing or otherwise removing the patina. When asked about the patination, Bartholdi (the original sculptor) suggested that it could be gilded to prevent further discoloration. No effort to that effect was ever seriously considered as far as I know. The treatment of the statue during the 1980s restoration was a subject of major interest to people who care about historic structures. There were a number of papers written about the restoration techniques employed in the repair work and the project was a major subject of the annual meeting of the National Association of Corrosion Engineers. Several papers were written and presented at that conference and later combined into a book on the subject."
"From the Roman point of view (or any slaveholder's point of view), slaves were investments. Wealthy Romans tried to maximize the value of their investment by training slaves to perform marketable skills (shorthand for secretarial work, vocational classes for goldsmithing, jewelry-making, etc.). These slaves were then often set up on a semi-independent basis as contractors, able to keep a portion of their earnings. This money became their peculium (individual property), with which they were often able to purchase their freedom."
"Thanks for the answer and linked sources.

It seems like Amo Afer's first thesis was lost, but the first article you cite by Bemile has some more background on it and on his views of race - quoting it here in case others are interested:

> As an erudite scholar in theology, law, natural sciences and philosophy, Amo argued in his first book “The Rights of Blacks in Europe” that both in terms of natural law and the principles of the then cherished Christian religion, the Blacks of Africa were entitled to all the privileges and rights that Europeans enjoyed on the European continent. He also ... declared unequivocally his stand, namely his affirmation of his identity with his fellow black people. He also discussed the historical and legal sources of the freedom and liberation of black kings from the Roman Emperor and how far the freedom and service of blacks bought by white Christians conformed to the existing laws  (Suchier, 1916:4). A disputation of this calibre had never been heard in Halle. A summary of its main argument was, therefore, published in the Weekly Newspaper of Halle, dated November 28, 1729."

">That is, while the 1835 act made it illegal to contract such a marriage, it had always been considered invalid under English common law for a man to marry the sister of his wife - and for a man to marry his brother's wife.

Is there firm evidence that this was actually the case though, for instance from earlier case law referencing common law? 

Because it seems equally likely that this is just attempting to justify and defend the law, by insisting that it wasn't actually anything new, but merely clarifying and upholding an older forgotten precedent.

>The basis for the prohibition against these kinds of marriages was the Bible, actually. Leviticus says that a man may not marry his sister, and in marrying a man and woman were considered ""one flesh"", so therefore a wife's sister and a husband's brother were as close to you as your own sister or brother from birth. It was as incestuous to marry them as it would be to marry your own sibling or parent.

Yes, Leviticus forbids a man from marrying his brother's wife, but Deuteronomy explicitly says that a man *must* marry his brother's widow, and that it was the duty of a brother-in-law to continue the family line of his brother. If a man refuses to marry his brother's widow, he dishonours his entire family.

Why is it then that the Victorians gave weight to Leviticus, but not to Deuteronomy? And why did they ignore the obvious reinterpretation of Leviticus in light of Deuteronomy, as referring to a man who married his brother's wife *while the brother was still alive* (in other words, regular adultery)? After all, the passage in Leviticus doesn't mention the original husband being dead, whereas Deuteronomy explicitly does."

"Google's ngram viewer for English-language books (confined to English, since Victorian England was mentioned in the question) shows peaks of references to ""Egypt"" or ""Egyptian"" in 1690, again in 1738, and 1803. (source: [Google ngram viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=egypt%2Cegyptian&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1600&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=5&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CEgypt%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CEgyptian%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2CEgypt%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CEgyptian%3B%2Cc0))

All of these peaks are significantly higher than the peak we see during the Victorian Era (1837-1901) or Carter's discovery of Tut's tomb in 1922. This makes me wonder if the true height of Egyptomania was earlier than we believed.

I suspect that the spike in Egyptian references in English literature in 1803 corresponds to the Napoleonic campaigns in Egypt (1798-1801) but I have no explanation for the peaks of interest around 1690 or 1738.

Does anyone know what could account for the spikes in Egyptian references around 1690 or 1738?"
"In part, it was because if the move to using more root vegetables, which grew will natively. Turnip, carrot, and potato all require more boiling than more delicate vegetables.

The habit was formed, then applied to foods such as broccoli, cabbage, and other veg that really doesn't need the same vigorous boil.

An additional note, is that regarding cooking equipment at the time, precise temperatures weren't really possible. So am instruction to fill and bring to a rapid boil for 15 minutes, for example, would vary considerably in results based on how quickly your stove could bring water to the boil.

The looseness of temperature and time in historical recipes is difficult for modern cooks to come to grips with. The expectation was that you would continually check the food and play it by ear."

I would like to address some of your quotes. [The Jefferson one is authentic](https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/no-freeman-shall-be-debarred-use-arms-quotation) and it is worth noting that Jefferson was a huge advocate of a person's individual right to bear arms -- but this is true for most of Virginia. 

The Washington quote is something I've never head of before -- however that doesn't make it false.  We have over 30,000 letters and pages from diaries of Washington, so no one can be expected to know all of them. However, if you go to [the National Archives' database on the founders](http://founders.archives.gov) which has over 30,000 of these pieces of writing from Washington alone, a simple keyword search will actually come up empty for this quote.  Now this doesn't mean this is entirely a made up quote, but I think there is a good chance that it is.  All the founders, but Washington in particular has had a wide variety of forged statements made in his name.  Even a brief google search showed only gun advocacy websites quoting it with no pointers as to where the quote originated. 

Please also keep in mind that most gun advocacy groups are not historical organizations.  They have their own agendas which I don't pass judgment on. However, they have no one holding them accountable for the information they post online, so I typically recommend being skeptical when reviewing some of them."

">But the mere fact that sacrifices continued regularly, century after century, in so many ancient cities suggests that the great majority took them quite seriously: the gods were real, and had to be placated.

There are many instances which amply demonstrate this, but here is one that underlines your point particularly well I think. I quote from Livy's *Ab Urbe Condita*, 41.16:

>The Latin Festival took place on March 5, and something occurred to mar its celebrations; the magistrate of Lanuvium omitted to pray over one of the victims for ""the Roman people of the Quirites."" This irregularity was reported to the senate and by them referred to the college of pontiffs. The pontiffs decided that the Latin Festival not having been properly and duly celebrated must be observed anew, and that the people of Lanuvium, whose fault made the renewal necessary, should provide the victims. 

What happened here is that a priest made a mistake during a sacrifice at the Latin Festival. This mistake seems minor to us but was deemed so serious by the Roman Senate that the *entire* festival had to be redone. This shows both how seriously they took their religion and how act/form was more important than belief/intent."
"In *Perpetrating the Holocaust*, it's stated that two artists, Karl Diebitsch and Walter Heck, designed them. There's a lot about Diebitsch in *Art as Politics in the Third Reich* (Jonathan Petropoulos): he was in charge of the Department for Cultural Research in the SS and served as an officer during the war, although his main duties involved overseeing artistic and architectural issues relating to the German state, producing porcelain pieces in factories at Allach and Dachau.

Heck seems to have been a much more minor figure, a graphic designer in the SS who possibly just designed the SS logo."

"You could hardly do better than the work of Dale Allison -- particularly his *Jesus of Nazareth: Millenarian Prophet*. (This is a substantive work that I think is better than Bart Ehrman's *Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium*, although the latter is often recommended as a general introduction to this topic, too.)

Allison focuses on the historical Jesus and his ideological background here, and has some really good insights from the comparative history of religion. He definitely addresses the issue of how the early church dealt with disappointment of (imminent) eschatological expectation; but if you want a sort of larger-scale study of how the church dealt with these sorts of eschatological expectations over the first few *centuries* or so, this probably wouldn't the first book you'd turn to. 

Actually it's hard to think what would be the best here. As the name may suggest, Brian Daley's *The Hope of the Early Church: A Handbook of Patristic Eschatology* certainly compiles a lot of the most relevant data on eschatology in the early church (over the first few centuries or millennium).

I don't know much about it, but Frykholm's *Christian Understandings of the Future: The Historical Trajectory* offers an even longer-ranging survey of Christian views on eschatology throughout history. (I know a bit more about *The Continuum History of Apocalypticism*, which also has some very good stuff.)

But if you're looking for works that focus on the historical Jesus and his eschatological background and the growth of the church in the first (or second century) vis-a-vis eschatological views, Dale Allison's still probably your main guy. He has a bit more recent exploration of some of the same things he covered in **Jesus of Nazareth* in his *Constructing Jesus: Memory, Imagination, and History*, too. There are also a few good introductory-type essays in the section ""Biblical and Patristic Eschatology"" in *The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology*.

In some ways, pickings are surprisingly slim, at least in terms of recent monographs on this issue that aren't prohibitively technical. Really, beyond this, things kind of fracture into individual articles in academic journals and stuff, or edited volumes that compile a lot of technical essays here (like *Apocalyptic Thought in Early Christianity* edited by Robert Daly); or just technical monographs on specific issues of New Testament interpretation Vicky Balabanski's *Eschatology in the Making: Mark, Matthew and the Didache* or Joost Holleman's *Resurrection and Parousia* or something. 

In any case, if you wanted a recommendations for one of these technical articles/essays on, say, a very specific sub-topic pertaining to New Testament interpretation or something in the early church, I could probably point you in the right direction.

But just to throw out a couple of last things: for other works that look at the broader eschatological landscape of Second Temple Judaism (as well as early Christian eschatology), you could check out Albert Hogeterp's *Expectations of the End* or the work of John J. Collins in particular.

"It's a great question and one that's worthy of its own thread! (The short answer, way down here in a thread is that it's deeply linked to local context and settings. In other words, if a superintendent attended a conference with speakers that pushed Junior Highs just as there was a population boom in his district and there was a need to build a new school and he liked the idea, he would likely advocate for a Junior High. In contrast, a Superintendent or Board President who was more interested in small class size, would likely advocate for more elementary and more high schools within their district. It's one of the factors that led to neighboring districts having different school configuations.)"

"This question has already been answered extremely well. However, I figured I'd provide a book recommendation. *Our Beloved Kin: A New History of King Philip’s War* by Lisa Brooks does exactly what you are looking for in your question. All names in the book are written in the Wampanoag language, not the later English translations. That's where the ""new history"" comes in at. Essentially it's tackling King Philip's War mainly from the perspective of the tribes involved and not the English. Although it makes sense to refer to people's names in their native language, Brooks takes it a step further by also referring to places in that language. This serves a couple of purposes. It really helps show how the Wampanoag had their own world, separate from the English, that has virtually been erased over time. The second is that it's actually really disorienting. I found myself getting somewhat confused and having to make sure I knew where something was happening and who was doing it throughout the entire book. While it may sound like a negative, it's actually the same thing that the English were going through when trying to figure out what was going on. It's written to purposely be confusing in a good way and forces you to take their language seriously."

Your question really plays into three related, but also independent, factors, namely the popular image of the Revolution, shifting ideas of Mexican masculinity, and the conception and image of violence in Mexican society. My own interests to this topic is tangential at best and ends with the Revolution, finding the conflict itself fascinating, but also attracted to the late 19th to early 20th century due to the expression of elite violence in the form of the duel and honor disputes in Mexican political society of the period. It is definitely related, as I *can* speak to the use, and threat, of violence was used as part of the construction of masculinity for Mexican elites in the fin-de-siècle, which absolutely forms part of the foundation here, I just can't speak to the latter 20th century and the shift. *But*, I can recommend you some excellent books that tackle the three themes I highlighted above, some singularly, but also in conjunction with each other!

* *The Tyranny of Opinion: Honor in the Construction of the Mexican Public Sphere* by Pablo Piccato: This is going to be background, as it focuses on the late 19th century, but it is an absolutely invaluable book for *me* in its focus on elite masculinities and violence in Porfirian Mexican society. Highly recommend it just generally!

* *Violence, Coercion, and State-Making in Twentieth-Century Mexico: The Other Half of the Centaur* edited by Wil G. Pansters: This is an edited collection with a wide array of essays covering different aspects of, well, exactly what it says on the cover. Several I think would be relevant here, and I'd specifically highlight the essay ""Policing and Regime Transition"", as it speaks to all three of the themes at points as I recall.

* *Cinemachismo: Masculinities and Sexuality in Mexican Film* by Sergio de la Mora: This looks at popular presentation of Mexican masculinity in film, including (but hardly limited to!) the Revolution. I would pair this with *Constructing the Image of the Mexican Revolution: Cinema and the Archive* by Zuzana M.

"I'll take a stab at this, in a limited way, as a political scientist, since I think what you're asking has as much to do with institutional arrangements within political systems as it does historical, cultural, and religious trends.

If you take just the four countries you listed, what you're comparing is one presidential system (the US) to three parliamentary systems. So, to start, it helps to understand the differences between these two systems with regard to how a head of government gets elected. In a presidential system, if you're an aspiring head of government, you have to face the entire electorate as an individual and, in most cases, you have to secure a majority of the vote yourself. One exception to that, of course, is the US, where you can certainly become president without a majority of the vote, but in many presidential systems, runoff elections are popular and guarantee that the winner has a majority of the vote.

In a parliamentary system, if you were an aspiring head of government, you'd run as an individual in the specific district you represent in the parliament, but becoming head of government (prime minister, in most cases) depends on how you've risen within your party and whether your *party* gets a majority of seats in parliament. Even more important, your role as head of government could be secured in a parliamentary system even if your party got a relatively low plurality of the popular vote or a low plurality of seats (which of these matters more would depend on the type of electoral system, but that's for another post), since you could always form a coalition with other parties in order to govern.

It's possible in a presidential system without runoff elections (the US) to become head of government with a low plurality of votes, but it's less common, since voters will generally split their votes between two or three main candidates, which means most victors will get majorities or at least pretty large pluralities. In short, the electoral threshold for becoming head of government in a parliamentary system is often lower than it is in a presidential system. Likewise, securing a majority of seats in a parliamentary system is also less dependent on voters' affinity for the specific individual who would be head of government, compared to a presidential system.

These institutional features answer your question, at least in part. [Jalalzai and Krook](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0192512109354470) wrote a paper in 2010 that explored this:

>In general, women are more likely to serve in parliamentary systems and more often as prime ministers than as presidents: there have been 40 female prime ministers and 31 female presidents. Some studies attribute the greater success of women in obtaining prime ministerial posts to their ability to bypass a potentially biased general public and be chosen by the party as parliamentary rules dictate (Whicker and Isaacs, 1999). Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom and Angela Merkel of Germany are good examples of women rising to power through party promotion (Clemens, 2006; King, 2002). This is different from the processes involved in becoming president within a presidential system, which typically relies on some sort of popular vote for ascension.

Basically, what the authors are suggesting is that it's much more difficult for women to overcome gender biases in a presidential system, where they have to face the entire electorate as individuals, than it is for women in parliamentary systems to rise to leadership positions within their parties and then see their parties to victory (which results in those women becoming heads of government). The institutional arrangements of parliamentary systems, then, would explain why it's possible to see a woman prime minister in countries where women's rights aren't as advanced while simultaneously seeing a lack of female leadership in presidential systems where women's rights might be more advanced. On top of that, in several examples where we have women as heads of government in presidential systems, their rise to power was precipitated by instability, such as the assassination or death of their male spouse, who was president himself, or their rise to power as members of politically prominent families. We see less of this in the US, although Hillary Clinton, as an example, was certainly a member of a politically prominent family.

Moreover, Jalalzai and Krook (2010) note that, in parliamentary systems,

>collaboration is fundamental: the qualities necessary for successfully formulating programs are negotiation, collaboration, and deliberation, all typically considered more feminine. In contrast, presidents in presidential systems act independently of the legislature and generally are expected to lead in a quick and decisive manner, traits which are more often associated with masculinity (Duerst-Lahti, 1997; Jalalzai, 2008).

So in addition to helping women overcome potential gender biases in the electorate better than presidential systems, parliamentary systems also tend to be more conducive to leadership traits that some researchers would argue are considered more feminine anyway. However, it should be noted, and Jalalzai and Krook point this out, that

>the women who reach top political positions do not always seek to promote women  
as a group. Leaders like Gandhi, Meir, and Thatcher invoked masculine styles of leadership and did not take steps to improve women’s status during their tenures in office.

That sort of follows from their point about leadership traits and gender. It's possible that, even though parliamentary systems may be more favorable to traditionally feminine leadership styles, prominent female heads of government still adopt traditionally masculine leadership styles, which might also contribute to overcoming gender bias in the population. 

In sum, the answer to your question may largely come down to the type of government in the countries you reference. However, I will note that, in two of your examples - Pakistan and India - prominent female leaders ended up getting assassinated. Indira Gandhi in India was assassinated in 1984, and Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan was assassinated in 2007. So while parliamentary systems may produce female leaders in countries where women have fewer rights, they don't necessarily guarantee safety, stability, and long-term success for those women."
"> Men's romantic friendships were also under fire with respect to their emotionality. The gradual militarization of western culture over the 19th century (think the Salvation Army or the military trappings of the Boy Scouts) drove/was driven by a narrowing definition of masculinity on ""muscles""--vigor, strength, athleticism, the Teddy Roosevelt stereotype. Whereas emotions had once been the healthy counterpart, gradually the internal dimensions of character and a value on openness and gentleness became a liability. (Marriage was still okay, because the idealized marriage was the husband/father rising up to 'be a man' and take care of his family).

I appreciated this, but also hope that you might be able to go into more detail? Yes, western culture was narrowed into ""vigor, strength, athleticism"", but why? What forces were driving this narrowing, and crowding out the 'healthy emotional counterpart' and 'making openness and gentleness' appear to be a liability?

In addition, how much of this is American-centric? Were there similar forces acting in Europe as well?"
"You have honestly made my day... it has been a difficult week, thank you!"
"I had thought that we had previous answers on this topic, but when I looked, they were all bounded to specific periods rather than exploring the change, so you get a fresh new one.

Contrary to the assertions in many of the now-removed comments, masculinity and tears have not always been at odds. I am not prepared to discuss when this began, but in the Middle Ages there was a trope of masculine weeping being a mark of religious devotion and knightly chivalry; by the sixteenth century it was well-established that a masculine man was supposed to have deep emotions and to show them - in some cases, through tears. Masculinity is *not* inherently constructed as relating primarily to brute strength and stoicism, although it's common for people to think that it is out of presentism (inserting modern values into the past), as well as a view that the past was when ""men were men"" and the modern version of masculinity is therefore a watered-down version of a previous version. 

The early modern British conceptualization of masculinity rested instead upon a range of virtues, from the more obvious strength, bravery, and honorable reputation to honesty, prudence, and self-sufficiency, with interpretations of which were more important differing based on how much patriarchal power and what kind of it different groups of men had. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the virtues of politeness and self-restraint came to the fore. A gentleman was to be courteous to women and other men, to talk problems out, to keep from bursting into loud displays of anger or drunkenness. You might think that that would also put the kibosh on weeping - giving way to feelings of all sorts - but this was not the case. Another gentlemanly trait of the eighteenth century was sensibility, which today sounds like it ought to mean ""rationality"", but is actually being aware of and susceptible to one's finer emotions. This was frequently represented in sentimental novels of the period in ways similar to those you've noted in your question: they weep out of sadness and pity, and sometimes faint when the emotion they feel becomes too much. (That being said, women were generally conceded to have a greater amount of natural sensibility than men on average.) Down the social scale into the middle classes, standards of politeness were more informal and concerns more restricted to physically-restrained conduct, and we have very little idea of what constituted 'masculinity"" in a working-class context.

Tears started to become more strongly feminized in the nineteenth century, and it appears to happen first with boys at school. Through the middle of the century, it was still acceptable for men to weep in their own grief, gratitude, or pity, or, for instance, while watching an emotional scene in a play or melodrama - Dickens once noted that he ""invariably [began] to cry whenever anybody on the stage forgives an enemy or gives away a pocket-book"". It was even laudable, to middle- and upper-class observers, when working-class men showed their humanity by crying at appropriate times. At the same time, an incident of schoolyard bullying in *David Copperfield* involves one student standing up for another and weeping to some extent as he does so, which results in a caning from a teacher and feminizing mockery from the bully: the student is definitely portrayed as being in the right, and we know that Dickens was a supporter of male tears, but in the context of a Victorian boys' boarding school showing emotion was simply not done. Other narratives of boarding and day schools bear out the same principle of self-restraint in the face of sensibility, with not ""blubbing"" in the face of beating being a point of pride and the people one missed from home being never mentioned except to your closest friends in private, and parenting manuals began to preach that children cried to manipulate and must learn to control themselves and their emotions.

The concept of the ""stiff upper lip"" - originally an Americanism! - started to become a key part of British identity in the 1870s and 1880s, as the children who'd faced this scholastic experience replaced the previous generation of adults and the so-called ""cult of sensibility"" completely died away, to be replaced with stoic self-restraint. Even outside of Britain, obvious tears from men and boys were seen as embarrassing. Men were to be utterly ""rational"" instead of emotional, or, more modernly put, were to value reals over feels. To not do this was to be unmasculine and womanly - and while male effeminacy had been a concern for a long time, this is the period that saw real ""scientific"" attention paid to issues of gender and sexuality, as well as more public discourse on the same, which could lead to serious consequences for the unmasculine man.

"Thinking on this from an agricultural perspective... if we're seeing New York as a center place for the growth of the pickled cucumber (and going into today, I'm not going into a NY deli WITHOUT getting a pickle) - were cucumbers a plant that grew particularly well and/our bountifully in the New York area? One thing we see in immigrants adapting their techniques to what's available locally, and back at the height of that, New York wasn't dealing with California produce, it was more local stuff. So, maybe instead of the vegetables that Italian or Polish immigrants used to use, they were unavailable or too expensive, but cucumbers were cheap and plentiful?"

"'Zed' was the original form in English, coming from the Greek letter 'zeta.' Starting in the seventeenth century, 'zee' became an acceptable alternative in England by analogy with other letters (bee, cee, dee...), and both were brought over to the Americas. Noah Webster, when compiling his famous dictionary which was the source of many divergences in American/British English, states flatly in 1828 that the correct pronunciation is 'zee,' although the Oxford English Dictionary quotes a source from 1882 that claims the American South still uses 'zed.'

There's really not a whole lot more to it than basic linguistic changes.

"The difference in context is what is important here. At the time of the battle of tuetoberger Wald where the Romans famously lost a number of legions, or even prior to this in the time of Caesars conquest of Gaul, the Germanic tribes (however poorly the word tribe fits) were small and fractious, covering a large area of uncleared forests. The labour required to transform this land into productive homesteads similar to Gaul would have been enormous.

After the Romans defeat at the hands of the Germans in the 1st century AD, Augustas effectively set the boundaries of Roman expansion. While they would continue to grow, with the aquisition of Britain in the 1st century, and those of Dacia and mesapotamia by trajan in the 2nd century, Hadrian rolled back much of these expansions and focused his energy on securing the defensible Roman boarders, running the length of the Danube, demarcating Rome from Germania. 

The Marcomanic wars during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the crisis of the 3rd century that followed set the end to any real possibility of Roman expansion into Germanic territory. This was a time that coupled Roman weakness (political instability, plague, a rising Persian empire) with an increase in the cooperation of the German tribes into larger confederations. These Germanic proto-states had the man power and the organization to be able to challenge Roman power on both sides of the Danube, and were a far cry from the disunified groups that inhabited the area in Caesars day.

From the time of Aurelian then, the Roman focus had shifted dramatically from an empire of conquest, to one which focussed on maintenance of it's territory. The 3rd century had shown that powerful men could not be trusted with large armies under their control, limiting Roman ability to campaign on multiple fronts. Persia was a constant threat, and Germanic raids/migrations/invasions rocked the western empire and it's ability to defend it's territory, let alone Rome's ability for conquest. The German tribes who would eventually inherit the western empire had become too strong and too unified for the empire to contain, leading to German expansion into Roman territory, rather than the other way around "

"The Greeks and Romans themselves saw no distinction between the accomplishments of painting and those of sculpture. The greatest painters, like the most eminent sculptors, were famed for their ability to capture life in every ineffable detail.

Sometime around the beginning of the fourth century BC, the great Greek painters Zeuxis and Parrhasius had an artistic contest. As Pliny tells it:

""Zeuxis produced so lifelike a representation of grapes that birds flew up to the stage building where it was hung. Then Parrhasius produced such a successful image of a curtain that Zeuxis, puffed up with pride about his birds, asked the curtain to be drawn aside and the painting revealed. When he realized his mistake...he conceded the prize, saying that while he had deceived birds, Parrhasius had deceived an artist."" (35.65)

There are many other anecdotes about the astonishing level of verisimilitude achieved by other great artists (Apelles and Protogenes, for example, had a similar contest). For our purposes, the important point is this: the Greeks and Romans never viewed painting as an inferior medium, and attributed almost photographic realism to the greatest painted masterpieces.

So: why do the ancient paintings we possess seem inferior to the greatest classical sculptures? To an extent, the problem is often an apparent failure to use scientific perspective, making the scenes and figures appear flat and cartoonish. Sometimes, as in vase painting, this is just a consequence of convention. In frescoes, it tends to be a failure of the artist, not his technique. When they wanted to, the Greeks and (especially) the Romans were perfectly capable of creating impressively three-dimensional scenes. Roman Second Style paintings, for example, often evoke [whole monumental cityscapes](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247017).

The most basic reason for the perceived inadequacies of ancient painting, however, is the simple fact that all of the masterpieces have vanished. Thanks to the Roman practice of producing copies of Greek sculptures, we have at least a general idea of the appearance and accomplishment of the greatest accomplishments in that medium. But with the exception of the frescoes of Pompeii and Herculaneum (and, to a lesser extent, mosaic copies scattered across the Roman world), ancient painting is lost to us.

Most Pompeiian frescoes are not masterpieces. They were never meant to be. They were the functional equivalent of wallpaper, rendered rapidly by teams of painters working from pattern books. The same is true of most tomb paintings, such as the example given by the OP.  But when the artists were exceptionally talented or exceptionally careful, we can still catch glimpses of the lost masterpieces of ancient painting. Take, for example, the famous frescoes of the [Vergina tomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergina#/media/File:Hades_abducting_Persephone.jpg), or the [Alexander mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mosaic#/media/File:Battle_of_Issus_mosaic_-_Museo_Archeologico_Nazionale_-_Naples_2013-05-16_16-25-06_BW.jpg) from Pompeii (a reproduction of a lost painting by the great Apelles). At least some classical artists could work wonders in two dimensions."

"Yes, that part of my answer was specifically about why fixed surnames first began appearing in England and France around the 12th and 13th Centuries, which is also what Hey's passage is discussing. Although, re-reading my answer, it's worded poorly, so I can see where I may have led to confusion.

If you read [the context](https://books.google.com/books?id=xvPUAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA55) in Hey's book that I quoted from, in fact, he's discussing how England broke away from the patronymic and epithetic systems used in other Germanic (including Scandinavian) cultures of the time, and why the fixed surname system was adopted. It appears to have originated in Norman France, and was adopted in England after the Norman Invasion of 1066, but as to why, the reasons remain unclear.

But notably, these were the *first* European cultures to adopt fixed surnames, as far as historians can tell. Most other countries of Europe didn't adopt them until centuries later. The next dominoes to fall were the Catholic countries, after the Council of Trent in 1563 essentially mandated fixed surnames be recorded in parish records. The Church of England mandated similar records (where fixed surnames were already in place, more or less) around the same time. 

However, other Protestant countries' state churches did *not* require fixed surnames when they began to mandate parish record-keeping, usually between the late 1500s and early 1700s. Sweden was not unique in that respect - Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and some of the Protestant German states did not require fixed surnames in that period, either. Same in Iceland, where the patronymic system is *still* in use.

The others only adopted them once their state churches required them, which happened at different times. In Sweden, this didn't happen until the 1800s. Older Swedes were ""grandfathered in"" to the old system if they wished, so there were still patronymic names in that country into the early 1900s. But I don't have any info on what specifically caused the change in the Swedish church. 

The only one of these late adopters I know the reason for was the Netherlands. In 1811, the Netherlands was occupied by Napoleon, who mandated a civil registration. That civil registration required the adoption of fixed surnames. When Napoleon's occupation was over, the Dutch government did not revert the order mandating fixed surnames, and Dutch people have been using fixed surnames ever since.

So, Hey isn't saying that we don't know why *patronymic societies kept them*. He's talking about why *fixed surname systems adopted them* between 1066 and the requirement of parish registers of baptisms and other vital records in the mid-1500s. In that period, in those places, the records are spotty, so we don't know exactly why, for sure, people began adopting fixed surnames in the countries where they were adopted. We can make some educated guesses inferred by what *does* survive, but we can't say anything conclusive."

"**Yes, and not always.**

Support for Nixon was extremely strong among conservative circles, particularly in the South, despite the scandal. Opinion polls taken in late 1973 and published in the first week of 1974 [showed vast support for the charges against Nixon, but on actual impeachment, the country was much more divided](http://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/06/archives/charges-against-nixon-called-justified-by-79-in-poll-of-impeachment.html). 

In the South, there was a popular belief that the moves against Nixon were [""little more than a Northern liberal plot,"" possibly even a Communist-inspired plot, to embarass the president.](http://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/mood-of-deep-south-is-against-impeachment-constituents-drop-by.html) When Nixon visited Jackson, Mississippi in April 1974, he w[as greeted by a cheering crowd of 10,000 people](http://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/26/archives/nixon-is-greeted-warmly-by-10000-in-mississippi-nixon-is-welcomed.html). The local paper, the *Jackson Daily News*, published a front-page editorial saying Nixon had been ""electronically lynched each evening in the living rooms of the land"" and that the media was to blame for the president's troubles.

Nationally, William F. Buckley Jr., editor of the *National Review*, [wrote a lengthy and impassioned defense of Nixon](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9D0CEEDF123DE63ABC4851DFB3668388669EDE) in the May 20, 1973 issue of the *New York Times.* Buckley wrote that it was inappropriate to judge the president by normal standards, and in fact what he did was not out of line with the actions of previous presidents. ""The evolution of the Presidency slowly, but not less certainly, transformed the office and presented the republic with an unwritten qualification,"" Buckley wrote. ""It is this: You must not impeach and remove a President merely for the purpose of punishing him.""

There was, of course, [ample response to Buckley](http://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/10/archives/letters-regicide-beating-raps-gorgeous-snob-william-f-buckley-jr.html). 

You might consider that Nixon had a large base of support (after all, he was elected President twice, and if you consider 1960, was nearly elected three times) that gradually eroded as more information became published. The *New York Herald Tribune* had a fairly typical pro-Nixon editorial stance before it went out of business in 1966 (h/t /u/texum for the clarification), as did the *Manchester Union Leader*. As the scandals of Nixon's second term gained light (credit the *Washington Post* here for picking up on stories that others discounted or underplayed), Nixon's support began to erode. The conservative magazine *Ideas* (it folded in 1975) was one of the longer-lasting defenders, as was William Safire, Nixon's speechwriter (before an abrupt resignation), penned a book partially in defense of Nixon. ""I'm writing this book sympathetic, but not sycophantic,"" Safire said in 1973, [two years before the book was published in 1975](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E04E0D81739E136A05750C2A9649C946490D6CF). 

When Nixon's transcripts became public in 1974, even people like Buckley deserted him. Only the hardest of hardcore supporters stayed with Nixon, and with friends in the House and Senate saying that impeachment and conviction were likely, Nixon resigned."
"He's joking, there were no reporters. Ancient accounts of battles are, depending on the distance from the event itself (in space and time) mixes of varying parts 'factual' accounts (from commanders and soldiers actually at the battle), and mythologising/literary constructs. With a few exceptions, you need to be very careful in believing ancient accounts of battles, and even the more reliable accounts need to be critically analysed. Ancient authors had many discursive purposes, and only very rarely was it the accurate descriptions of historical detail. 

In reality, we don't really have hard data with which to construct intricate re-creations of battles. Those 'extremely detailed' videos on YouTube are either trusting in the sources far too heavily, or are engaging in fanciful reconstruction (not necessarily a bad thing). Most likely they're doing both. "

"It is unlikely that most Russians would have experienced any ""foreign"" foods until that point. Keep in mind that aside from the logistics of transporting fresh foods great distances, the Soviet Union had experienced nearly 20 years of war and conflict by the 1930s: the First World War, the Russian Revolution, the Russian Civil War, then the collectivization and industrialization campaigns (which further disrupted people's lives).

I also took a look through some literature (the best source on this era would be *Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s* by Sheila Fitzpatrick; it specifically focuses on Russians living in urban areas), and there is a lot of reference to Russian staples (bread, fish, meat, etc). This of course doesn't mean that they couldn't have some other foods, but when you consider that the country was undergoing a massive transformation, I would be inclined to state that getting some Georgian cheese or something would be far down the list of priorities. It's notable as well that aside from the Aragvi (which opened right before the Soviets were invaded in 1941), the other ethnic restaurants in Moscow came after the war ended, when things were a little calmer, and the country was able to enjoy prosperity for the first time in a long time."

"For /u/freddymungo:

The book you definitely want to start with Renate Blumenfeld-Kosinski, *The Strange Case of Ermine de Reims: A Medieval Woman Between Demons and Saints*! RBK does a really great job placing Ermine and her confessor in their social and religious contexts. The last part of the book includes some of the *Visions* in translation, too.

For a particular case that's utterly fascinating--magic used by a woman (at her brother's instruction) to acquire literacy that turns out to invoke demonic possession as well--the introduction and commentary in Nicholas Watson and Claire Fanger, *John of Morigny’s Flowers of Heavenly Teaching: An Edition and Commentary*. (Fanger also has *Rewriting Magic* on John and Bridget, but I find this book kind of grating with here ""my scholarly personal journey is as important as my research"" angle)

And for /u/Chamale, unfortunately, I'm not aware of any of the summae confessorum in English translation themselves (or even better, the mock scripts intended to teach similar things). There are a couple of similar types of text in the *Pastors and the Care of Souls in Medieval England* anthology--a list of reasons people could be excommunicated, and a list of questions that Church officials investigating how good a priest was at his job should ask. A lot of those concern the conduct of the laity (""Whether any lay persons play sports in sacred places"").

It's possible there is something in the *Medieval Popular Religion* anthology, but I don't have that in front of me so I couldn't tell you for sure.

The snowball example is quoted in Steven Ozment, *The Reformation in the Cities*, but if you go down that road be aware that his ""medieval confession led to the Reformation"" thesis is...disputed."
"I cannot answer for other fields, but in Theoretical Physics they had some of the greatest minds of the 20th Century. The most famous of which was Lev Landau, whose textbook series ""Course of Theoretical Physics"" is widely read and held in high regard by students and academics to this day. It should also be noted that the Soviets did make notable advances in many areas, for instance the Tokamak design of fusion reactor was initially developed there."
"Since the 10 Year Rule was ancillary to the specific answer of the question I glossed over it. To be more precise, the 10 Year Rule was government policy that assumed no major war would happen in the next decade and was implemented in 1919. I took the end of the war to be the signing of the Treaty of Versailles but that is understandably a bit confusing and unclear since most people view the war as having ended at armistice day. 

The rule as policy was specifically aimed at the decade of 1920 since Britain had strained itself economically to carry out the war; combined with drastic demands for better social welfare and other reforms that had been coalescing since the late 19th Century, there was too much strain on the treasury to fund both post-war recover programs and continuing military expenditure. The 10 Year Rule was not a halt on war planning or military development. Famously the Experimental Mechanized Force was formed in 1927 to test developments in armoured warfare thinking. It was largely a halt on the expansion of military spending which meant that all branches of the military were constrained to a smaller budget, which was further diluted since the RAF was established as its own independent service arm. This prevented the expansion of the military, which in particular affected the Royal Navy as they were the force least able to expand rapidly and thus more reliant on consistent peacetime funding. The armed forces being institutions that exist primarily for war still planned as if they were going to eventually fight an enemy. However, they now did so under much greater financial constraints and under the additional assumption that the outbreak of a major war within that period was unlikely given the aftermath the previous one.

The policy was made perpetual in 1928 which in essence led to the assumption that there would be no major conflicts in the foreseeable future and implicitly that Britain would take measures to avoid a military conflict. The 10 Year Rule was eventually dropped in 1932, though the financial situation was still highly constrained due to the effects of the Great Depression. It was more of a budgetary and political policy than a military once since its real effect was tying the purse strings of the arm services which continued to apprise defence requirements and attempt to meet them."
"Good question! Instinctively it doesn't seem likely that a local guide would be very helpful to an invading army. However, in most Greek wars, there would be at least some local sympathisers: allies from neighbouring states who knew the ground, local enslaved people with hopes of liberation, members of a local political faction hoping to benefit from regime change, or even mercenaries looking to change their allegiance for better pay. When we hear of local informers it is usually because those informers are willing to offer useful information. For example, when the Persians invaded at Marathon, it was because they had been guided there by Hippias, the deposed tyrant of Athens looking to regain his power. But sometimes armies were wrong to trust the locals:

> The Persians had for their own safety appointed the Milesians to watch the passes, so that if anything should happen to the Persian army such as did happen to it, they might have guides to bring them safely to the heights of Mykale. (...) They acted wholly contrary to the charge laid upon them; they misguided the fleeing Persians by ways that led them among their enemies, and at last they themselves became their worst enemies and killed them.

-- Herodotos 9.104

As a result, armies often didn't trust local guides and either stuck to well-known ground (for instance the usual roads between cities) or went in blind, to some extent. Aineias the Tactician writes in some detail about how defenders should use their superior knowledge of their own territory to hide and move troops, set ambushes, and generally make it impossible for an invading army to approach the city itself. This is where local people would effectively have a map-level knowledge which their enemies lacked."
Is it thought that biphasic sleep might be more common in pre-industrial societies _away_ from the equator (and less common among those near the equator)?
"Simply put: there is no such thing as a ""neutral"" accent. What many people in media, journalism, and the performing arts learn in their training is to *neutralize* the specific regional aspects of their native dialect for the sake of broader affect. The General American, or sometimes called Standard American English, dialect is often considered the most neutral *sounding* American dialect, but there is much debate on whether it is a true dialect (it sounds a lot like native dialects from Ohio) or a scholarly-constructed (and therefore, taught) dialect. But GA is the dialect that most non-American actors learn when playing American characters.

Edit: *Dialect and Language Variation* that I mentioned above covers this and would be a good source to turn to.

Edit 2: I forgot to mention that the BBC accent you mention has its roots in what's known as Received Pronunciation (or RP) and was taught in English boarding schools largely in the post-war period."

"Its hard to really give a precise timeline as to when they were supplanted. During the Gilded Age, both parties in the US were split between Progressives and Classical Liberals in essence, albeit with different views on other issues. It was really with FDR and the New Deal that we see the triumph of Social Liberalism in the Democratic Party and the fusion between Conservatives and Classical Liberals in the Republican Party, and as many here will note that wasn't really fully complete for some time, with both parties having wings that hew to either side. It seems to have finished its completion by the 1930s', but when you can say it happened is really hard to say."
"I mean, I think that professional historians have done a pretty good job reviewing the book, but without just recounting the laundry list of errors, Manchester was the author of a bunch of books on mid-20th-century US figures, who then just decided he'd write a book about the backwardsness of medieval Europe, a topic he didn't understand and had no training in. I feel like half of being a medievalist is just debunking the same handful of misconceptions over and over again, and so for this book to have even been published, let alone required reading, is just really frustrating to me."

Were they referencing the Temple ruins or did they believe there to still be an in-tact Temple? Or, were they somehow testing him to see his response?"

"The Middle ages (and the earliest Modern period that followed) was an era before uniforms as we understand them. Compared to say, the 18th century, there wasn’t a standardized, color-coded way to tell friend from foe. Instead, there were a variety of kinds of battlefield identifications used in different times and places in the medieval era to identify individuals, groups within an army, and armies. Because I study the later Middle Ages, I will discuss the period from around 1250 through 1500 or so. I will leave it to others to discuss battlefield identification in the early and high middle ages.

Battlefield identification had always been an issue. In the 13th century, the introduction of closed-faced [helms](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Topfhelm_DHM_transparent.png) made personal identification on the battlefield and in the tournament even more difficult. While older scholarship mentions helms as the impetus for crests and heraldry, more recent work questions this -  schemes to identify knights existed prior to closed-faced helmets. That said, in the 13th century means of identification became much, much more common. In the late 12th and 13th century, two ways of identifying individual soldiers developed. The first was heraldric surcoats and shields - coloring the surcoat (the loose robe worn over the armour in the 13th and 14th centuries) and shield with specific colors in specific patterns to identify a particular man at arms. The systems of heraldry is much more complicated than this, and relates to the construction of the knight as a social identity in the 13th and 14th century, but the battlefield/tournament use is still important to remember. The second was the [crest](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/KHM_Wien_B_74_-_Great_helm_of_Albert_von_Prankh,_14th_century,_front.jpg), a sculpted ‘topper’ for the helm generally made of parchment or leather. The design on this would often be somehow identifying, though it was not necessarily related to the user’s heraldry. Finally, in the 14th and 15th centuries as plate armour developed armour itself was decorated in ways that were individualized (for those who could afford it). The Black Prince’s Guantlets had gadlings (brass knuckles, basically) in the shape of a lion, one of the animals emblematic of the English monarchy. In the Early modern period, armour decoration became more developed - the armour of say, Otto Heinrich, Count Palatinate of the Rheine, was gold and black, to match his colors. Charles V had his armour decorated with the symbols of his domains - primarily Burgundy (and more specifically, the Low Countries, which he had inheritted from the Duchy of Burgundy). Such decorated armour would help identify its wearers to friends (so that they could rally to defend them) and foes (so that they would know to capture them alive).

The effect of this was that an individual man at arms could now be identified by those who knew his crest and heraldry or his armour - such as by people who knew him personally, people fighting next to him, or (as the system of heraldry developed) professional heralds. However, since they are individual identification neither crests nor heraldric colors helps identify which side someone is on unless you know which side he is on, indvidually. That said, heraldry and crests served another important role - when soldiers were captured for ransom, it allowed their easy identification. It also allowed for the identification of the dead after battle (assuming that the corpses had not already been stripped, as often happened). 

A solution that we see in the 15th century is the introduction of livery coats to identify the men in a certain lord’s retinue. This is most extensively used in England during the period of the Wars of the Roses. A livery coat was a garment provided by a lord to his retainers (contracted soldiers) as part of their contract of ‘livery and maintenance’ (along with pay, food and wine/beer). It would be in a specific color, that would not necessarily be related to the Lord’s heraldric colors, and often bear a badge associated with the lord (again, not related to the lord’s heraldry, necessarily). For example, Richard III’s men wore a badge with a boar on it. Wearing livery allowed men to identify the fellow members of their retinue, but didn’t necessarily identify which side every retinue was on.

EDIT: Tobias Capwell has also argued that the decoration on a number of late 15th century painted sallets [like this one](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a7/bb/c7/a7bbc784097587a05218bfb2643ffccb.jpg) were painted as a form of 'unit identification' by groups of medium cavalryman fighting for the city of Nuremberg. Essentially a group would all have monster faces painted onto their helmets. The evidence is not conclusive, but the idea is evocative at the very least.

Finally, there were army identifiers. Famously, Henry V had the English Army at Agincourt wear the red cross of St George. Similarly, in the late 15th century the Duke of Burgundy had his soldiers wear a red st Andrew’s cross to identify themselves. In [this illumination from a swiss chronicle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Schilling_murten_bern.jpg
)you can see the soldiers of Burgundy wearing an ‘x’ shaped cross fighting swiss soldiers with a ‘+’ shaped cross, the cross of Switzerland. These army identifiers might be worn on a livery coat, or sewn onto the clothing, or displayed on armour in some way. However, note that the soldiers are not wearing anything resembling a ‘uniform’ - the cross is a modification to their existing clothing, not a uniform garment worn by everyone.

In the end, there was not a uniform (heh) way of identifying one side from the another on the medieval battlefield. Friendly fire incidents did occur - at the Battle of Barnet in 1471 some Lancastrians mistook their own reinforcements for Yorkists, throwing the Lancastrians into disarray as they fought each other. However it should be noted that Barnet was fought in the fog - unusually low visibility for a medieval battle (though Towton 10 years earlier was fought in a snowstorm). Indeed compared with the smoke of an early modern battlefield, visiblity on a medieval battlefield would be relatively clear (though this clarity would decrease as the 15th and 16th centuries progressed). 

It is important to remember that the melee was not necessarily the normal shape of medieval combat. In infantry warfare especially, tight formations were the norm. As Christine de Pisan wrote in 1409 (as quoted in Keen’s ‘Medieval Warfare’): ‘Two great evils can follow from a disordered formation: one is that the enemies can more easily break into it; the other is that the formations may be so compressed that they cannot fight. Thus it is necessary to keep a formation in ranks, and tight and joined together like a wall.’ In this case it would be obvious who your friends were (the man next to you) and who your enemies were (the guy in front of you trying to jab a pike into your face). Contemporary military historians do not necessarily think of pre-modern battles as bloodthirsty free-for-alls, but instead a series of attacks and counter-attacks that could at times seem quite furtive as each side sought to maintain their cohesion and exploit any weaknesses of the enemy. That said, there were times - when cavalry charged, when reinforcements arrived, or when a group of men fled, that things could get quite chaotic. Then a badge of your army or lord might help you...or it might not.

"Modern media has a tendency to portray pre-electrified rooms in a fashion much brighter than a contemporary person living at that time would have experienced while moving about in them. Indeed, by modern standards, the average dining room or ballroom of the 18th century would have been vastly underlit, especially if one applied the illumination of that period to the relatively spartan décor of today. The designers therefore employed a sleight of hand when creating their rooms: almost every surface was reflective in order to amplify the light.

The first recognisable chandeliers appeared sometime during the early reign of Louis XIV and were, themselves, an evolution of the [candelabra](https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2019/excellence-pf1911/lot.92.html), a type of portable candlestick that contained several arms (typically six) versus a standard [chamberstick](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2019/style-silver-ceramics-furniture/cbd2eb43-1ee0-4cb9-bc3e-f28f42458813) consisting of a single light that would have been used by an individual in a private setting, such as reading, going to the bathroom or other nocturnal activities that require a source of light. They were also technologically different from earlier large hanging light fixtures by virtue of the intensity of light they gave off, thereby making a cohesive plan for lighting a room possible. These [early chandeliers]( https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/a-louis-xiv-ormolu-six-light-chandelier-attributed-5639216-details.aspx) were invariably made of parcel gilt wood and ormolu or, in the case of the Sun King himself, out of sterling or gilt silver in order to better amplify illumination in the room. This light would have then bounced off several other reflective surfaces such as sterling silver [flatware](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/200240) and [hollowware](https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/soupiere-et-son-couvercle-en-argent-par-6196916-details.aspx?from=salesummery&intObjectID=6196916) -- itself an improvement upon the earlier and [less reflective pewter](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1900-0212-1) of a generation prior -- [brass fixtures](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/206990), [gilt ornament](https://www.kunsthandel-muehlbauer.com/en/object-detail.html?id=129) and any other object that could scatter the light. What modern eyes therefore view as a riot of rococo excess, an explosion of gold and silver detailing on walls, would have been far more muted when experienced in person under candlelight. In some cases, guests arriving at night could not be expected to make out paintings at all.

Jules Hardouin Mansart, the court architect to Louis XIV, ran into this precise problem when he was charged with displaying a set of massive tributary and allegorical paintings of Louis XIV in the Grande Galerie of the Palace of Versailles. These paintings, created by the Sun King’s favourite painter Charles Le Brun, could not be seen by arriving guests and Mansart was charged with undertaking this technical challenge. The issue of light soon began to plague Mansart as he struggled with the challenge of illuminating the ceiling of a cavernous room: after lowering the ceiling *twice* (it is about two yards shorter than the actual roofline) and blowing out the windows to three times their original size in order to let in sunshine and starlight, the paintings could still not be seen in detail by observers below. Mansart’s final innovation, an extraordinarily costly wall of mirrored windows set perpendicularly to a concave roof vault, did the trick and made the Grande Galerie into one of the most famous rooms of all time. When Louis XIV first launched his fete to inaugurate the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, he spent nearly 117,000 livres on the party – a third of the annual cost of running the vast chateau – and spectators were awed by how *bright* the room was, an effect compounded by the king’s use of fireworks outside. Indeed, the room is quite literally more vivid at night when fully illuminated by candles than it is during the day when its details are lit by modern LED lighting, as can be seen from [this picture](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Vz-htNRWpbeI-UU7og2BGacHwVoeN09XrsoRX0ucvFstfJ5Fv6xp8rtXEr2D82C7XoUlgXPdc8TuCgr4wQn965PE8JeyLExPctwIi17YHJsI8g) from the Hall of Mirrors' 2007 renovation. (While the thought of any sort of active fire in the Hall of Mirrors would undoubtedly make a docent scream, the modern lights are made of historically accurate wax and designed to approximate the effect of being lit by candle.) In short, not only was light expensive, it could also be dazzling in every sense of the word, a demonstration of the host’s taste, power and refinement. Candles were, relatively speaking, cheap. But the other accoutrements required to really make a room shine were not.

By the mid-19th century, chandeliers were composed of two forms: the solid metal chandelier and the lead crystal chandelier. The latter was naturally brighter by virtue of its thousands of delicate pieces, called pendants, made from lead crystal and then faceted in order to increase the scattering of light in the room. The fashion for these lead crystal sconces and chandeliers reached their height in the late Victorian era – the cultural trope of the French chambermaid and her featherduster comes from the Victorian propensity for dusting everything – but the cleaning process for both is relatively straightforward. Household staff would clear the room of furniture and lower the chandelier via an internal pulley system in the wall onto a drop cloth lain down on the floor of the room for disassembly. The individual pieces would be marked, boiled in batches in order to remove any errant wax and washed in soap and water. They were then put together using cotton gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints.

In most cases, the wax was less of a problem than you’d think as long as the candle stood upright in its nozzle. In this case, a little bit of wax was actually welcome. Footmen or maids would insert a small piece of sticky material, typically beeswax comb, onto the bottom of nozzles in order to allow the candle to stand perfectly upright. During the course of an evening, the candle wax would empty out into the drip tray, which would have to be removed and boiled every few days in order to accommodate wax buildup. In some brass chandeliers, especially those used in commercial or industrial settings, the drip tray could be quite large in order to accommodate a bigger candle and to clean them less often.

Servants would often replace a candle before it became a sticky mess for this reason. They obviously could not do it during an event, but illuminatory candles generally had some staying power. British East India Company employees experiencing culture shock are a good source of material about burning times. In Europe, the best wax candles burnt for somewhere in between four to five hours. The average Indian candle could burn for upwards of ten and were allegedly imported to Britain in enormous quantities prior to shifting some production back to the metropole. At any rate, the candles and wax never went to waste.

Senior household staff were generally expected to have their pick of remaining (but used) candles for their own personal use. Leftover wax in drip trays, especially if the candles were made of beeswax, were popular items for polishing furniture and floors. Wax, especially the paraffin wax candle patented by James Young in 1856, could be resold due to the petroleum-based nature of these products, but more often than not wax that couldn’t be used domestically was simply dumped along with other refuse in the cesspools. In Georgian London, these were cleared of their “night soil” every four to eight months by workers. This is where most of the remaining wax ended up.

"I have to disagree a bit here. Metal armor was increasingly discarded from about 1600 on, and what metal armor was worn in the 17th century was largely plate, such as [this set](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1524/1342/products/Armor.jpg?v=1571454064). Notably absent is any mail neck protection. By 1700, only cavalry wore any metal armor, and by the middle of the 18th century, that had been pared down to a breastplate and a steel cap for the cuirassiers (heavy shock cavalry). I'm doubtful about the idea that mail aventails, which were last worn in large numbers in the 16th century, had any direct relationship to 18th century military fashion.

Bearskin caps also predate Napoleon by about two generations, first appearing in the 1760s."
"Perhaps (unsurprisingly) this answer might vary depending on where you're located, your gender, your race, and what you want to consider as ""roaring"".

Coming from a North American perspective, the short answer is ""relatively roaring"". While you might not be taking transatlantic vacations, several aspects of everyday life make even those earning a modest living a chance to increase their purchasing power.

Earlier in the decade however this was not necessarily the case. While America saw a period of an economic boom during WWI supplying the war effort, after the war the U.S had a surplus of goods it couldn't sell to a devasted Europe so unemployment rises and people couldn't pay back their loans or creditors. 

After a short recession in the early 20s President Coolidge famously said ""The chief business of the American people is business"". Market regulations under him were being removed and the economy enters a more ""laissez-faire"" period. This in turn meant that money and credit is cheap to borrow by 1927. 

Though Europe might be recovering from the war, American consumerism is on the rise as they still have the infrastructure in place to mass-produce things making them cheaper and more accessible to the common person. For example, owning a radio goes from 60,000 people at the beginning of the decade to 10 million by the later half of the 1920s.  People are in a spending mood and again, consumer credit is a major driving factor behind everyday people buying things like cars to furniture, radios, to household domestic items. In short, borrowing money or credit is no longer seen as something only poor people do. 

The driving factor behind all of this credit and borrowing is of course; the stock market. Historian Charles R Geist notes that ""the excess spending of the decade was based on the perception that economic life was getting better all the time and the stock market was proof of that"". The stock market becomes a sort of symbol of the American dream. American businessman John Raskob noted in 1929 (before the crash) notes that ""if a man saved 15$ a week and invested in common stocks and allows the dividend and rights to accumulate, he will be rich"" While Raskob was a bit deluded on just how easy it is to become rich (given the average salary at the time was 20$) the ordinary person can now speculate and invest in the pursuit of wealth. 

So the average U.S citizen has more money now. So what do to with all of it? Spend it of course!

In 1928 65 million movie ticket sales are reported weekly, and as people like Fitzgerald will have you believe nightclub culture booms and along with most people owning radios, jazz becomes synonymous with the times as it's played in nightclubs and radios across America and Europe. 

What's also notable about the economic boom is that now women have more money than they ever did. The ""flapper"" lifestyle is not only an aesthetic choice but one that subverts the traditionally female role into one where women have more independence. 

Though there is an economic boom, it doesn't spread to everyone, everywhere. 

Rural America struggles to make it out of the post-war recession. Many parts of the south and the midwest languish in poverty while other places in the country boom with prosperity. 90% of the wealth is held by only 5% of the population. 

Despite the popularity of jazz music, African-Americans remain on the economic margins often being barred from the most popular jazz clubs and being mistreated by their white managers. 

While the decade saw enormous amounts of prosperity, it was not distributed evenly and was mostly concentrated. And while credit was cheap, and spending was rampant, the bubble would eventually burst. 

The average person could buy more things than ever before and spend leisurely time on entertainment like never before. But this was not the standard way of life across the board.

"Even if this might sound ironic today, with the increasing concerns about State imposed restrictions on civil liberties and the push for immigration reform, France is still occasionally referred to in French as the *pays des droits de l'homme* (""the country of human rights""). Maybe the videos you are mentioning have been heavily influenced by the more recent years of political strife in France, especially the Yellow vests movement of 2018-19. Even if this movement has been one of the biggest in recent memory, for decades, protests have become something of a tradition in France; strikes and protests of 1995 (on Social Security reform), 1987 (on the State's railway workers conditions), 1968 (May 68, among other things), and 1947 (on post-war labor conditions following the Marshall Plan) are just a few examples. The story is almost always the same: people go on strike, public transportation grinds to a halt, negotiations drag on, and finally after a long while, they reach an agreement. According to this [2018 study](https://www.etui.org/content/download/38617/388428/file/Strikesmap_20200407.pdf) by the ETUI (European Trade Union Institute), France is among the top European countries in numbers of strike days by 1,000 employees, topped only by Cyprus.
 
Like many of its neighbours, France has known its fair share of peasant revolts (the *Jacquerie*) before the Revolution of 1789. However, even in the years that followed the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the right to protest was still heavily repressed in France. 

In 1791, Le Chapelier law passed by the National Assembly banned the formation of trade unions (guilds and *compagnonnage*) and the right to strike, making them criminal offenses. In May 1864, the Ollivier law lifted the ban, making some forms of protest legal under certain conditions, although they were still heavily repressed. The right to free enterprise was the main argument here. The Ollivier law was further completed in 1884 by the Waldeck-Rousseau law, allowing the formation of trade unions. It was not until the 4th Republic, in October 1946, that the right to strike has been fully recognized in the Constitution. However, with the political instability of the 4th Republic, this principle only really took under the current French republic.
 
What makes France such a special place for protesting? On the whole, the one thing that truly stands out throughout all these events is the deep culture of power relationships in the French social fabric. Not unlike in the US where we often encounter a lot of healthy skepticism towards government, the French have maintained an anarchist/collectivistic subculture that has consistently kept authorities on their toes. This was especially true before the 1970s. Then, the French Communist Party (PCF) was one of the biggest political forces in France, with its strongest bases among the labor and rural areas, as well as many intellectual circles. The PCF was part of the French governments from 1942 to 1947, with electoral support ranging from 26 % to 30 %. This also happened during many years of nationalization of large parts of the French economy (banking, insurance, healthcare, gas, auto industry, aviation, so forth).

In reaction, the French government’s attitude has always been strict regarding its own people, even under the 4th Republic and current regime. At the founding of the 5th Republic in 1958, the spirit of the Constitutional drafters was the President was to be an independent figure, free from all parties, and focused on the State’s long-term objectives and big picture stuff (strategic interests, international trade, national sovereignty, building a European community, etc.). After the de Gaulle and Pompidou presidencies, there has a been a slow shift of the actual decision-making process from the National Assembly to the office of the President, leading to an increase in centralized decisions by the Presidency (true to a long-lasting French Jacobin attitude) and to a decrease in the influence and accountability of the other elected officials. This shift was been particularly noticeable during the Mitterrand years (1981-1995), again with the participation of the PCF to the French government from 1981 to 1984. By then, France was up against the devastating effects of the two oil crises (1973, 1979), leading to a surge in unemployment and price increases. However, the socialist government’s plan to help the economy recover thought consumption was largely a failure, forcing the government to denationalize some sectors to avoid further damage, which still lead to another increase in unemployment also and ultimately to the socialists defeat in 1986. 

This criticism of presidential overreach and lack of local/regional accountability is probably, to this day, one of the main reasons the French people still feel the need to express their views so publicly.

It would be very interesting to see the long-term impact this protest subculture has had on the country as a whole, aside from the image of France as a place where people strike all the time for any reason. The question of how many of those protests/strikes have effectively led to change is truly here the heart of the matter.

In conclusion, if History has taught us anything, strikes and protests are going to be a part of French culture for a very long time.

"This is related to the first question, and may even answer it. But it's basic physics, not history.

There are two kinds of nuclear energy: fission, and fusion. 

The energy is called ""nuclear"" because both fission and fusion operate on the nuclei of atoms.

The nucleus is the part with most of the mass, and it's made of a clump of smaller particles called protons and neutrons. The rest of the atom is a cloud of much lighter particles which surround the nucleus some distance away from it.

The number of electrons in an atom matches the number of protons. Neutrons tag along for the ride. 

The electron cloud around atoms defines how chemistry works - which is basically the science of electron bonding and exchange between atoms - and also defines the physics of semiconductors, electronics, and of pigments and colours. (Neon tubes and LEDs are both special kinds of electron interaction that convert electron movements into light.)

All of this happens at relatively low energies. You can make electrons do their thing with a tiny battery connect to a little low-power LED. You can also use much higher energies - lightning literally rips the electrons from air molecules on its way to/from the ground - but generally electronics and electrical circuits are fairly tame. And most importantly, they don't go anywhere near the nucleus.

To get to the nucleus, you have to use much higher energies. 

You may remember from high school physics that like charges repel. But a special mechanism called the Strong Nuclear Force keeps protons and neutrons from flying apart - as they would do if it didn't exist. 

Because of the strong force there's a *lot* of energy trapped inside the nucleus. It's not unlike a collection of very powerful magnets forced into a confined space. They *really* want to fly apart, but the strong force won't let them.

But the strong force has limits, and some nuclei split apart spontaneously - making them radioactive. When the nuclei split, some of the trapped energy is released, and the remaining parts - protons, neutrons, electrons, and some left over bits and pieces, in various combinations - all fly off at very high speed. This is called fission.

Some heavy nuclei - specifically some kinds of uranium and plutonium - have a very special property. When they split apart they produce three high speed neutrons. These can slam into adjacent nuclei and force them to split apart too. 

If you start with a blob of pure Uranium or pure Plutonium, you can create a chain reaction and make it explode. Given enough of a start a few atoms split producing a cascade of neutrons slamming into other atoms, which split apart producing more neutrons, and this carries on until some large proportion of the atoms has been split. And a lot of energy has been released. 

This is how an atomic bomb (A-bomb) works. Getting a chain reaction to start is complicated and difficult, and so is preparing the right kind of plutonium or uranium in high enough concentrations. But if you get the preparations right, you're guaranteed a Hiroshima-style bang.

This is also how a nuclear reactor works, with the difference that in a reactor the uranium or plutonium fuel is fashioned into thin rods, and the body of the reactor is a made of a neutron moderator - sometimes graphite - which slows down the neutrons and keeps the chain reaction from running away and exploding. There are also control systems - further moderators, in the form of rods - which can be dropped into the reactor core to control how fast the reaction is running. 

Reactors can't explode like a bomb, but a graphite core can catch fire - as happened at Chernobyl, and also in an earlier nuclear fire at Windscale/Sellafield in the UK. If the cooling system fails the core can also become hot enough to melt, usually with an associated chemically-caused (hydrogen) explosion, which is what happened at Fukushima. Both are very bad outcomes because they spread radioactive dust from the core over large areas. 

This science used to be called atomic physics. Research began around the turn of the 20th century, and at that time there wasn't as much of a distinction between physics and chemistry. Physicists knew atoms existed, but the distinction between electrons and the nucleus hadn't been mapped yet. Nuclear physics started to split off formally in the 1920s, but there was still overlap between nuclear physics and atomic physics because both are technically branches of quantum theory. So the distinction was never quite formalised - Quantum Mechanics and its descendants being more of an umbrella discipline for both until at least the late 1950s. It was much easier to go with the ""atomic"" label, partly for legacy reasons, and partly because it was a reasonable description of what scientists were doing. 

So the initial reactor research by Enrico Fermi in 1942 and the Manhattan Project bomb effort both used the ""atomic"" label. (The first reactor was called an ""atomic pile"".)

After WWII populations were naturally terrified of atomic weapons, and there was a propaganda push in the US called Atoms for Peace which attempted to concentrate on power generation, large-scale engineering, and even some medical applications. You could even buy a basic atomic toy lab with real uranium for your kids. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_U-238_Atomic_Energy_Laboratory

This continued with Project Plowshare in the US during the 60s and 70s, which attempted - and failed - to find cost-effective and safe uses for nuclear explosions in large scale engineering. The USSR had its own equivalent, which was equally unsuccessful.

So why the change to ""nuclear""? Partly because splitting atoms isn't the only way to make energy. 

You can take light atoms like hydrogen and helium, and if you squish them together hard enough they will stick together to make a heavier atom. Counterintuitively, this produces a surprising amount of left over energy.

You can't do this with a chain reaction. You need very high temperatures and pressures - such as those generated by an atomic fission bomb. 

This process is called fusion. It's how the sun produces heat and light, and it's also known as a thermonuclear reaction, because of the intense heat/pressure required to make it work. Fusion bombs start with a fission bomb, and then add a special mix of lighter atoms - modern bombs use a solid called lithium deuteride, because it's much more convenient and stable than using gasses like hydrogen or helium - which creates a separate fusion process. These bombs have often been called H - for hydrogen - bombs.

The result is absolutely terrifying amounts of energy - potentially thousands of times more than the Hiroshima bomb.

And so far, fusion reactions are only useful for weapons. While it's possible to build a fusion reactor in theory, it's incredibly difficult to keep the temperatures and pressures stable for long enough to produce a controlled energy source. It's so hard it still hasn't been achieved after 70-odd years of effort. Current fusion designs are still experimental - in the sense of investigative - and the official joke is that fusion power has been fifty years away for more than fifty years now.

At some point thermonuclear was shortened to ""nuclear"" and blended with ""nuclear physics"". By the end of the 1960s ""atomic"" started to become tainted with Cold War propaganda and general lunacy - like radioactive children's toys, and plans to change river courses with gigantic explosions - and started to fall out of fashion as an unserious word on grant applications. There wasn't a single defining moment which made it obsolete, but there was a clear generational shift during which ""nuclear physics"" took over as the definitive term. By the early 80s this had spread into nuclear power engineering, and from there into popular descriptions in the media.

Thus silver that was not melted into currency would likely be melted into bars for storage."

"Medieval iconography certainly had its types and tropes--I'm not sure if it was deliberate, but the bald head and the beard on the snail in the image I linked look iconographically like St. Paul ([here he is](http://i.imgur.com/xEVZI4a.png) in Monreale Cathedral in Sicily, built by the Normans who hired artists trained in Byzantine mosaic technique to adorn its interior). But the thing about the snails is, they're not always deployed the same way. Sometimes you have a knight jousting a BIG snail, sometimes you have a yelling angry snail on its own, sometimes you have a knight jousting a little snail, sometimes you have other animals jousting on top of snails.

Where we see jousting snails and other miscellany like this is decorative borders and random illustrations in luxury manuscripts. I tend to think of them a little bit like the cartoons and random drawings in the New Yorker--little illuminations that don't illustrate the text. There's a couple decades in the 1300s, for example, where adding strawberries to borders suddenly became A Thing--and then it stopped.

Jousting snails are especially common on the edges of Psalters and Books of Hours--that is, prayer books, that people were meant to read over and over and over. And luxury expensive ones, often intended for display. Would a jousting snail be something to smile at, for the artist in the course of illumination or the reader in the course of contemplating the Passion? Would it be like the lyrics of ""Stairway to Heaven,"" something that each new reader could find meaning in, or that could mean different things to the same reader on a different day?"

I really like this question OP, and it's very timely. I'd also love to hear about how the Monarchy was regarded at this time (ie: Did people even really care whether the Queen was competent/qualified? Or was the role moving towards being a figurehead that, while having some cultural significance, is mostly politically irrelevant so it didn't really matter? How much political/social/cultural/international/economic damage could an incompetent Queen really have wrought, if Elizabeth had ended up being much less adept? Did major events like the initial escalation of the Cold War have an influence on the public's perceptions?)


Literally my only context for the Monarchy at this general point is from watching the King's Speech, which made the role seem incredibly important for the war effort (though I'm sure it was heavily editorialized for the sake of story). "

"> Perhaps more importantly, he introduced them also to the idea of ""survival of the fittest"", which was a major theme in the writings of reformers and revolutionaries like Liang Qichao, Kang Youwei, and Sun Yat-sen.

It is worth stressing that this was not simply a matter of Western imperialism vs a homogeneous 'China'. Darwinist and Social Darwinist language was explicitly used to justify racialised rhetoric employed against the Manchus. Quoting Liang Qichao (translation from the above-cited Pusey 1983):

> The myriad years from the time when first there were living things upon the earth until today... can be described in a single word – 'racial strife'. In the beginning animals struggled with animals, then men struggled with animals, and finally men struggled with men. First savages struggled with savages, then the civilised struggled with the savages, and finally the civilised struggled with the civilised, in endless struggle stretching back throughout all time. Alas, this is the law of the struggle for survival. Not even a Sage can do anything about it... According to the law of the survival of the fittest, members of an inferior race must be devoured by a superior one. Day by day, month by month, they will slowly be eaten away until there are no more of them left, and their race no longer lives upon the earth.

In the same essay, he writes

> Manchu and Chinese – it takes no expert to establish which is the superior race and which the inferior.

While it was Liang and the other radical constitutionalists who were particularly enthused with racialist rhetoric, given the reach of the constitutional movement this sort of rhetoric was pretty widespread: for instance, Li Yuanhong, who led the revolutionary army in 1911, was an outspoken Han nationalist. And as Pusey notes, Sun and the revolutionaries were no less vehement in their anti-Manchuism, indeed more so given their refusal to even tolerate an interim Manchu monarchy."
"Ahh.. gotcha. The disdain for literature and poetry as a part of formal education in the 18th century wasn't limited to texts from a particular country. American schoolmen weren't fans of British, colonial, or French ""pleasure"" texts mixing with academia. "
"A few quick background bits of history before we begin. The 1812 Overture was written in 1880 to commemorate the Russian victory over Napoleon during his invasion of Russia. It was originally written as part of the festivities for the opening of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, also built to commemorate that victory. The Tsar would also have his 25th anniversary of coronation in the same year, and an All-Russia Expo was coming to Moscow, so that idea was that the piece could be used as a big part of the spectacle for these events.

I say that because the piece has become overwhelmingly associated, at least in the US, with a completely different event: 4th of July. And this association is actually one of the biggest reasons why the cannon fire is so well-known today.

I'll get to that in a minute. First, did Tchaikovsky ever hear the piece with the cannon fire as he intended?

The original idea not only included very precise cannon fire, but an additional brass band along with the pealing bells of the cathedral and other churches in the area. The cannons were going to be set up to electrical switches that would set the off at precisely the right time. This was a very complicated undertaking, but hey, the Tsar wants a big celebration, the Tsar gets a big celebration.

Except, Tsar Alexander II was assassinated in 1881, before the planned celebrations. This, along with the fact that the cathedral didn't finish on time, meant that the piece was premiered in a tent at the Expo, with no cannons or bells.

It still made an impression, though, and became one of Tchaikovsky's most well-known pieces. When he went on conducting tours it was usually on the program, most famously at the dedication of Carnegie Hall in New York, which he led in 1891. However, it seems that none of these performances, nor most of the performances in the decades after it was first premiered, featured the cannon fire as written in the score.

Part of this was practical. I am not a military expert, so someone who is could possibly chime in about 19th century artillery. There are 16 shots in a roughly two minute period in the piece. There doesn't seem to be any contemporary cannon that could be safely reloaded and fired this quickly, necessitating multiple cannons (and multiple crews). The electric switches in the original plan were devised to get around this, but that was a much more complicated proposition at the time than it would be today.

The [earliest recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLslEM4DqXo), from 1915, uses percussion instead of cannon fire, and this was the common practice for many years. Other orchestras used rifles firing blanks in their performances rather than the more cumbersome cannons. But the big breakthrough came when recording technology was advanced enough to allow overdubbing.

In 1954, Antal Dorati [recorded the 1812 Overture with the Minneapolis Symphony.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rINP5ssEAgY) They then recorded a set of muzzle-loaded cannons at West Point, and overlaid those into the final recording. Herbert von Karajan did the same in [1966 with the Berlin Philharmonic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyQc0A1liaQ)

So audiences were starting to get familiar with the concept of actual cannon fire in the piece. But to really cement it in peoples' minds, another great conductor and showman would make it part of an American tradition...

**(in case it's not clear because of the edit, this continues in my reply to this comment below)**

**EDIT:** As u/TheMusicArchivist points out, the cannons and bells in the original score are not necessarily a *musical* choice by Tchaikovsky. Since the original idea was for this to be performed as a part of a big celebration, the main point was more to make a lot of noise than for great musicality. In fact, Tchaikovsky was not a huge fan of the piece himself, saying that it was ""very loud and noisy, but lacks artistic merit, because I wrote it without warmth and without love."" It's worth repeating that he conducted many concert performances of the piece indoors without the cannon fire, which suggests that he didn't think it was a musical necessity."
"There was actually a period of peace, known as the Peace of Amiens, as it was a result of the Treaty of Amiens, from the end of the 2nd Coalition in March 1802 until May 1803. By March 1803, it was already very clear that war was back on the cards very soon. The negotiations were wrapped up in late April IIRC,  a few short week before the resumption of war in May 1803.

Had the American delegates arrived a couple of weeks later, or the negotiations been protracted, the involvement of a British institution in the transaction may have proven rather more tricky."

Among the most famous cases where new information affected the perception of historians was the case of Alger Hiss, an American official accused of being a Soviet Spy shortly after World War II. He was indicted and ultimately convicted of perjury about his supposed spying and eventually served 3-4 years in prison.

The Hiss case was, in many ways, the absolute Rorschach test to determine a person's political leanings. Those on the left mostly had an absolutely belief that he had been railroaded during an era of anti-communist hysteria. Those on the right felt it was clear that he was a Soviet spy working on behalf of his foreign masters. This extended to historians as well. There seemed to be little middle ground for nuanced takes.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Hiss case was among the first to receive intense interest. Ultimately there was no clear ""smoking gun"" establishing Hiss' guilt, but there was more than enough evidence to make it clear in most historians' minds of Hiss' guilt.

A good rundown of the entire story can actually be found on the CIA website: https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol44no5/html/v44i5a01p.htm

In terms of my area of expertise (left-wing European terrorism of the 70s-80s) there was an absolutely shocking revelation after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

West Germany had been plagued by the Red Army Faction for almost 20 years; this Marxist terrorist org had bombed and murdered many Germans and Americans in West Germany in their effort to kickstart global Revolution in the west.

Members of the RAF were often extraordinarily successful and remaining hidden and underground. The West Germans knew that sometimes RAF members would go through East Germany on their way to places like the middle east; the East Germans knew who they were and tolerated them (typically grilling them for hours about their radical affiliations, before allowing them to continue).

What was unknown was that East Germany (or more accurately a small subset of the East German Stasi) had allowed 11 wanted members of the Red Army Faction to flee to East Germany, provide them with new identities, and live in East Germany as carefully hidden citizens. And even more shocking was that some members of the RAF who stayed underground in West Germany, traveled to East Germany to underground specialized weapon's training from the Stasi, before heading back to the west to use their new-found expertise (including an unsuccessful 1981 RPG attack in Heidelberg on a high ranking American General).

Though these were Stasi efforts, it has been alleged that the Soviets were either somewhat or completely aware of these efforts. Masha Gessen, a superb journalist, made a startling claim in her biography of Vladimir Putin that when he was stationed with the KGB in Dresden (mid to late 1980s), he regularly communicated with underground RAF members who were travelling through and would negotiate with them to have them bring him prized West German items like Blaupunkt stereos.

I have yet to actually confirm this story; and it does read a wee bit ""perfect"" (the current head of Russia just happened to be work with terrorists that were part of an ongoing war with the west). But I have no particular reason to doubt Gessen, who claimed to have learned it from an unnamed former RAF member she interviewed.

During the Cold War it was often assumed on the right that the Soviet Union was the master behind all forms of terrorism across the globe. On the left it was typically assumed that each group, be it the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command, or the IRA in Northern Ireland, or ETA in Spain, or the CCC in Belguim, or the Weather Underground in the US... each group was essentially independent and homegrown. It was also assumed that Eastern Governments generally did not try to support radical movements in the West; they were as much interested in detente and maintaining the status quo as the West.

The reality of the era, with knowledge gained since the fall of the wall, shows that the truth was more in the middle. The soviet union, and particularly East Germany, were not actively leading and directing the various global left-wing terror groups. But they sure did take an active and on-going support role."

"PART II

So why did Van Buren appointing another lackluster special prosecutor matter for New York's anti-Masonic movement?  Because it served as a tangible focus for political opposition that had been looking for a home.

That's because a good part of the answer to your question about 'why are there so many conspiracies?' comes from the fact that paranoia about Masonry proved for a short time to be *extremely* good politics.  What I realized when writing this up, though, is that in order to explain this more than superficially, I need to sidetrack to the administration of the most prominent anti-Masonist of them all, John Quincy Adams, and how his naivety was instrumental in unintentionally laying the groundwork for the political side of the movement.

Adams has received substantial love from historians in the last 15 years or so, and it's not unreasonable; he is one of the tiny handful of antebellum politicians whose positions and actions don't need rationalization almost 200 years later, he's probably the greatest Secretary of State in United States history, and once he finally figured out how to effectively use his office after a few years bumbling around (he was genuinely shocked to discover that once elected to the House, Jacksonian Democrats were intent on isolating him to prevent another Presidential run), his post-Presidential career as a Congressman is nothing short of remarkable.

But as President?  A comparison that comes to mind is Jimmy Carter: good human being but often nearly incompetent politician.  Years earlier, Adams had alienated significant portions of the Federalist party - especially Daniel Webster - long before everyone else was forced out by its implosion as he voted with the Jeffersonian Republicans on multiple issues while a Senator, was essentially expelled from the party, and refused to accept being viewed as or running for office as a Jeffersonian Republican - but to everybody except him he was one given his prominent appointed positions from Madison and Monroe.  When he achieved the Presidency, more recent scholarship suggests the infamous ""Corrupt Bargain"" with Clay that enraged Jackson was probably not quite as bad as it seemed on the surface - among other things, a year earlier apparently all the campaigns had fully expected the election to be decided in the House.  Even accounting for that, though, it still was one of the most naive political blunders of any incoming President, roughly at the same level as Carter alienating his own party leaders in Congress by deliberately snubbing them from inauguration onwards, and possibly only second to Buchanan actively monkeying behind the scenes to urge *Dred Scott* to be decided in the most conclusive and radical fashion possible 4 days into his term (since by Buchanan's bunglingly disastrous political calculus, he figured if the Court weighed in, he could forever put the slavery question to rest without spending any political capital to get what he wanted.)  Clay may have received the bulk of the personal hatred and later called it the worst mistake he ever made in his life - it almost certainly was responsible for keeping him from later becoming President - but its effect on Adams' ability to pass legislation from the day he took office can't be overstated either.

For self-inflicted wounds to his political support during his administration - rather than the standard political blunders all Presidents eventually make that drain it - Adams may actually be unsurpassed.  Even though the election cycle had rather bluntly suggested otherwise, he decided that the Monroe administration had proven that factionalism had finally ended, and therefore that he would govern as did George Washington - a leader above party and politics.  (That Washington actually didn't govern that way never really registered for him, which considering how close to power Adams was for most of his life tells you a little bit about how obtuse he could be.)  Worse yet, given this perspective he deliberately chose to avoid using the powers of the office, especially patronage, to enforce any party discipline among his supporters; having half your Cabinet work in secret against you is not exactly a recipe for success.  Last but not least, in an environment that had moved towards populism and found its standard bearer in Jackson, the man who spoke 5 languages and had been part of a legation at 14 was viewed by many as an elite snob: 

>""[When Adams] accepted an invitation in December 1827 to participate in the commemoration of the defense of Baltimore thirteen years earlier...he proposed a toast: “Ebony and Topaz,” he offered. “General Ross’s posthumous coat of arms, and the republican militiamen who gave it.”  The audience scratched their heads. What was the meaning? Realizing that he had puzzled the group, Adams hastily explained that the allusion was taken from the French writer Voltaire’s Le Blanc et Le Noir, in which Blanc (white) stood for the good Americans, and Noir (black) for the evil British invaders. The Jacksonian press was delighted. Once again Adams had shown himself to be an elitist steeped in European culture and out of touch with his own countrymen.""

As a result, the Jacksonian Democratic Republican faction in Congress began to emerge as a separate party and became a solid voting block against the administration.  In turn, despite having a nominal majority in the first two years of his term, Adams own supporters (variously referred to as ""Adams men"" and later as the National Republican party) were disorganized, with little campaign support, less Presidential leadership, and most importantly for the purpose of this answer, almost no party organization to speak of.

While we tend to think of Jackson being responsible for creating the new party system that emerged in those years, in many ways Adams was just as responsible given how the political vacuum at the top trickled down to the opposition.  The problem was that the amorphous mess the latter left in his wake was wildly scattershot and remained so until the late 1830s; my favorite description of the political chaos comes from New York, where six years of opposition looked like this:

>""[Jacksonian Democrat] opponents in New York were, in rough succession, the Clintonians, the People’s men, the National Republicans, the Workingmen, the Antimasons, and then the Whigs, formed in 1834.""

So that was the political landscape that missing-and-presumed-dead turncoat Mason William Morgan disappeared into, and why anti-Masonism in many ways was perfect for the times.  Instead of organizing around a negative - their dislike of Jackson and his policies - opponents finally had a cause to rally around: that Masons, their secrecy, and their oaths to each other that ranked above those given to the state were responsible for corrupting democracy and needed to be cleansed from the political system.  This included the former Grand Master, Old Hickory himself, and his campaign organizer, Martin Van Buren, who while not a Mason given his support for one and apparent cooperation with the subversion of justice by that evil organization served as an appropriate target of the wrath of the righteous.  And for the first time in their political history, the former Federalists who composed a good part of the anti-Masonic movement could offer a populist solution of their own.

I'll explore the actual efforts of anti-Masons like Adams, Seward, and Thaddeus Stevens in [Part III](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t955n3/why_were_the_freemasons_so_controversial_in_the/hzwb629/), which is now up in a separate thread!"
"The stereotype is simply not true. I have two previous answers on this topic:

"Livy was something of a skeptic about such things, but he managed to combine his skepticism with a healthy dose of Roman patriotism. Both are on display in the preface of his history: 

""The traditions of what happened prior to the foundation of the City or whilst it was being built are more fitted to adorn the creations of the poet than the authentic records of the historian, and I have no intention of establishing either their truth or their falsehood. This much license is conceded to the ancients, **that by intermingling human actions with divine they may confer a more august dignity on the origins of states**. Now, if any nation ought to be allowed to claim a sacred origin and point back to a divine paternity that nation is Rome. For such is her renown in war that when she chooses to represent Mars as her own and her founder's father, the nations of the world accept the statement with the same equanimity with which they accept her dominion.""

Livy's contemporaries - or at least the educated contemporaries for whom he composed his history - seem to have had no objections to his rationalization of the Roman foundation myth, not least because it was coupled with such obvious enthusiasm for the greatness of Rome."
">There is no source that definitely tells us when pickled cucumbers just became pickles.

Idle interest put me down a bit of a rabbit-hole, and I don't think there is a *definitive* answer, but I think we can at least trace some threads of informed speculation to narrow down on the reason and rough sense when. My first stop was the OED which was mildly useful in pointing to it being an American development, and then the *The Cambridge World History of Food* helped trace a very general path that the cucumber traveled. Finding Jan Davidson's *Pickles: A Global History* almost gets us there, but still doesn't quite spell it out. 

What I can offer though to expand on the excellent context you've laid out here is that the cucumber came over to North America with the earliest European invaders, showing up on Hispaniola before 1500, but the Dutch are the most important part of *this* story, cultivating cucumbers in New Netherland, and that cultivation taken over by the English when they transformed it to New York. Unlike some other things which can be pickled, but are fine not-pickled, cucumbers really weren't that popular at the time raw - they were considered quite bitter [the cultivars you eat today mostly developed in the late 19th century, so don't necessarily reflect how early modern cucumber would taste] and thought to cause indigestion - so pickling was the nearly the only preparation. In volume of production, New York became the pickle[d cucumber] capital of North America. 

This is where Davidson gets vague though, and think it lines up well with your own thoughts above, since is points to there not being a *clear* point of transition, but does very clearly lay out that it was a reflection of preferences and pride. Because cucumbers were almost entirely consumed pickled, *and* because of the pickling industry of New York, it came together for common reference to them by Americans as simply 'pickles'. It certainly *started* by the late 18th-century, but the problem then is to say when it had taken over as ubiquitous, since as you well lay out it still wasn't *fully* the case even entering the 20th century.

As you say, this is quite deceptively difficult to pin down! The broad strokes, I think, can be well traced, but the roots and the end point seem to be so separated out that I doubt there is really one, single point that could be said to be when things tipped over."
"Great question! The history of Sci-Fi is older than one might think! As my colleagues have told a bit about your question in particular, I am going to tell a little about Sci-Fi books in general, and try to show how the Sci-Fi genre has developed and thought of in the past. Basically you could say: Sci-Fi has always existed, since Sci-Fi means to think about your current issues, and your own future. But all right, here goes:

The gentleman on this [admittedly somewhat dated spaceship](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Godwin_man_in_the_moone.jpg) is Domingo Gonsales. Around 1635, Bishop Francis Godwin sends his literary character on a journey to the moon in ""Man in the Moone"" (its in the upper left corner of the etching). Dominigo Gonsales lives on an island for a time and uses geese as oversized carrier pigeons until he realizes they can carry an amazing amount of weight. He flies them to the moon, without any safety precautions, as the understanding of space was pretty basic at that time. He lands in an environment he can barely comprehend. Huge trees, unknown animals and plants cavort around him and he meets the moon's inhabitants, who live in utopian conditions.

There are many things in Dominigo's journey that are typical of sci-fi. He could have landed on James Cameron's ""Pandora"" and his situation would hardly have changed: Everything is different, as you would expect in a sci-fi movie. ""Avatar"" didn't surprise anyone thematically in 2009 - but geese-powered space travel in the 17th century, how does that happen?

Around 1635, [the question of extraterrestrial life is raised](https://galileo.ou.edu/sites/default/files/Wilkins-1684-a000-tp.jpg) in England, as it is only a logical consequence of the numerous discoveries and conflicts in the church. For a long time in Europe there was just one orthodoxy that taught you the reality, and now this condition is destroyed. So how can one be sure what is right? These religious crises, of course, also have origins in the European voyages of discovery to the ""New World."" One can ask pointedly: After Humans were discovered outside of Europe, why shouldn't there be some living on the moon as well? 
The fact that the foundations for sci-fi were laid in times of uncertainty and change comes as no surprise when you think about the genre more closely: that's exactly what it's there for today. Of course, people want to be entertained first and foremost on galactic journeys, but underneath that, sci-fi is always dealing with issues in contemporary society. Star Wars is in places a discussion of democracy, Wall-E or Interstellar deal with the final consequences of climate change, and The Tributes to Panem are ultimately social criticism, with bows and arrows that is.

It's no different in early modern literature. Why sci-fi is so well suited for this can be seen in Thomas More's ""[Utopia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Utopia.ortelius.jpg),"" or in ""Gulliver's Travels."" While these are not sci-fi books in our sense, both books are about countries with different social systems. Utopia shows how a regulated state can appear just and benevolent, and thus indirectly takes sharp criticism of the conditions of the time. Gulliver's Travels - actually an entertaining adventure - shows a similar side: political offices are given to those who can jump the highest, for example, and the inhabitants of the [floating science city of Laputa](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/48/4e/85/484e85cb12efa8c54728f726fbbc1408.jpg) are otherwise almost incapable of living, despite their high intellect - The book is a satire of England at the time throughout.
Admittedly, it doesn't sound very sci-fi, so please excuse the brief digression, because the concept of fictionality is very important in this question: both books fictionalize their fantastic journeys, which is a key moment for establishing a sci fi literature genre. The protagonist in Utopia forgot to write down where the island was, and it's similar in Gulliver's Travels. This may have been due to the somewhat *ruffle* stricter censorship and legal authorities of the time, but it also helps to present social criticism in a more abstract way, so that you can better apply it to your own circumstances. 

Fair enough, though, I've babbled long enough. Now what would sci-fi be without the future? Besides this spatial travel, it already needs something else: time travel.

Basically, it doesn't matter when a sci-fi story takes place: Star Wars happened thousands of years before our time, and yet it's futuristic. The idea of time travel, however, was first tested in literature in 1770: by Louis Sébastien Mercier. In his book ""2440"", a Parisian unexpectedly wakes up in the then distant future and finds himself, you guessed it, in utopian conditions. What is so important about this is that fictional islands become reality here, or rather, future. So it's not quite ""utopia"" anymore. An important step is made here, this makes Sci-Fi realistic.

From this point on, sci-fi rapidly evolves into what we are used to today, and this is mainly due to industrialization and advancing mechanization. Voltaire goes on an intergalactic journey in 1752 and ""Le Dernier Homme"" from 1805 shows an end-time scenario of the last remaining humans. In 1826, the first human being wakes up from cryo-sleep and in 1864 Jules Verne sends us to the center of the earth. And with H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds the first invasion of extraterrestrial invaders follows.

In the 20th century, sci-fi established itself as a genre in its own right, according to the motto: 75 percent literature, 25 percent science. Thats where I'll cut off, after that there'll come Metropolis, which will have repercussions up until today and Sci-Fi has already evolved to what you know of it today.

TLDR. In early modern literature, to get to Sci FI, we went from Utopia to dystopia. Sci-fi is a mirror of our times - and through exiting the here and now, both in time and space, it can draw societies as they might emerge and discuss our ideals and issues today. Whether these are positive or negative projections doesn't matter in the end. Thats why early examples of Sci Fi Literature, there is no heavy aspect laid on the scientific or technical side. Just like today, a good book should tell a compelling story and thats what these ""Sci-Fi""Books cared for; explaning what could be possible.

By the way, there are quite a few sci-fi works from antiquity that I haven't listed here. That's because it's not my area of expertise, but also because they've had little influence on the development of our genre today.We started here with Thomas More's Utopia. Sci-fi elements can be found earlier, but they are quite decoupled with the development of the genre. These are, for example: the Sanskrit epic Ra-Mayana with flying machines and weapons of mass destruction, or Anthonios Diogenes' lost journey to the moon. The Thousand and One Nights also has sci-fi gadgets at the ready. But as I said, these works have relatively little to do with the ongoing development of our genres.

"So first, I need to explain that television sitcom actors from the 1950s had a wide range of dialects that was a result of their training and/or performance background. Many of the most well-known actors of the period began their careers in theatre, radio, and/or Vaudeville. Those early acting opportunities shaped much of the development of their popular characters and acting styles once they appeared regularly on a television sitcom. Broadly, actors made dialectical choices for their characters that they had been working on and refining for much of their careers. But, you are specifically asking about the ""circus carny"" sound of men and the strident quality of women in television sitcoms of the 1950s, so I'll try to address that directly.

&#x200B;

The vocal qualities you describe for 1950s television actors are addressed by Jessica Taylor in “Speaking Shadows”: A History of the Voice in the Transition from Silent to Sound Film in the United States"" (*Journal of Linguistic Anthropology* Vol. 19 Issue 1, 2009), wherein Taylor frames her analysis of dialect/speech in early American media through the frame of the film *Singin' in the Rain* (1952). Taylor's critical analysis of the premise of *Singin' in the Rain* follows the qualities you identify for female actors of the period: their voices were often perceived as shrill or strident (and thus in need of coaching or adjustment of some kind). So, it's important to note that the ears of the 1950s were perceiving many of the same qualities you are perceiving. Piggybacking on Taylor's article, I would say that characters like Lucy from *I Love Lucy* may have been purposefully working from this expected auditory perception as a way to enhance/alter the visual aspects of her character so as to create a comic affect. (Personally, I think Lucille Ball was a genius at this, but I'll defer to anyone who knows more about her career and character/vocal choices.) As Taylor identifies: audience ""expectations were, in many ways, determined by discourses around appropriate gender performance"" (10). For more on these qualities and how their affect on listeners, I would suggest reading *Women and Radio: Airing Differences* (2014) on the history of women's elocution lessons, perceptions of the female voice, and early radio technology.

&#x200B;

But back to your question: did actors *choose* to speak this way? The best answer is yes, they did. In the two sources I mentioned above, the authors do much to explain that socio-economic understandings of the early-twentieth century did much to shape the perception of gendered voices and dictated the ways in which actors were educated in dialects based upon their characters and audiences. So an actor with a background performing in Vaudeville shows was trained to reach a largely working-class immigrant audiences and would often employ dialects and accents that would reach those audiences to bring them toward a stronger comic affect. In addition to the sources above, I'll add Jane Hodson's book, *Dialect in Film and Literature* (2014) to the list of sources that explain how early film and radio had strong expectations for gendered voices that, for the most part, achieved the ""proper"" dialectal qualities of the mid-atlantic dialect (the socio-economic and cultural reasons for this are addressed--though not through an analysis of dialect--in Michele Hines' chapter, ""The North Atlantic Triangle Britain, the USA and Canada in 1950s Television,"" in *Transnational Television History: A Comparative Approach*, 2012). With the growth in television ownership across the USA in the 1950s, the sitcom format began to do much of the same type of thing that Vaudeville was doing in the early part of the century: reach the working-class American and counter the affluent sound of the mid-atlantic dialect. The same types of acting strategies that worked for comic performances 30-50 years earlier were affective choices for the TV sitcom as well. I do not mean to suggest that a certain class of Americans actually spoke like TV sitcom characters, but it is a long tradition of comedy to employ exaggerated accents/dialects that give a character the perception of being ""lower"" or less intelligent so as to elevate their audience and make it easier for people to laugh at the ridiculous situations the character finds themself in. In summary, what you're hearing from those characters is likely exactly how the actor wanted you to hear it. But, in the 1950s this vocal quality probably held a stronger affect than it does today as comic expectations and affect changes with time (but that's not to say that sitcoms on the 1950s aren't still funny!).

"Without knowing which particular lists you're looking at, I suspect the universities you're thinking of that keep reappearing are Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc. In effect, what you're seeing is the replication of privilege in American higher education. (I answered a question about college in 1920 [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/brg4g1/im_an_early_20s_university_student_in_new_york/) that provides some additional context.) 

To take it way back to the beginning, higher education in the American colonies is generally recognized as having started with a small endowment and donation from John Harvard to the Massachusetts Bay college that was later renamed in his honor. The school served young men (all white, save a few Indigenous men connected to the Harvard Indian College, until the 1900s) and operated more like a boarding school than a college as we think of it today. The average age of students was around 15 1/2.

As the various colonies got their feet under them and developed a need to formalize education systems, men in positions of power or access to power (i.e. non-disabled white men) in early America created spaces for formal education for their sons. So, just as Boston gave rise to Harvard, New Haven men established Yale, Princeton men established Princeton, etc. In total, nine institutions were established during the colonial era. They are: 

* Harvard University
* College of William & Mary
* Collegiate School (Yale University)
* College of New Jersey (Princeton University)	
* King's College (Columbia University)
* College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania)
* College of Rhode Island (Brown University)
* Queen's College (Rutgers University)
* Dartmouth College

A primary goal of these schools was networking and they served their purpose. Classmates went on to found law firms, businesses, and work in government together. Subsequent generation of men would send their sons to the same institutions they went to so that their sons could network with the sons of other men in power. This pattern continued well into the 1900s; men who made the lists were men in power, or had access to power, and they associated ""good"" with where they went and where they were planning on sending their sons. It became a reinforcing feedback loop: men in power went to these particular schools so if a young man wanted a position of authority or power, he would attend one of those schools.  

To be clear, however, these Colonial Colleges were not the only institutes of higher education. Colleges for young women were established but they served a different purpose. A young white man went to a Colonial College because he was destined (or his father thought he was) to be a great man. A young white woman went to a woman's college because her future son was destined for greatness. Free Black men and women, simply did not attend the Colonial Colleges. They instead, attended schools like Oberlin, which quickly established itself a rigorous college for non-white male (and female) students as it followed a classical curriculum not unlike that seen at Harvard. While Oberlin did enroll white male students, they were more likely to lack political connections and specific education required to get into the colonial colleges. A man with more humble aspirations, or more limited means, might go to one of the land grant colleges that were founded in various waves during the 1800s. To be sure, not all of the Colonial Colleges are held in the same high esteem in the modern era which has a lot to do with endowments and how various states support colleges within its borders. 

This relationship between ""good"" and ""exclusive"" and how power traditional works in this country can also shed some light on why so few Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or Tribal colleges are seen on such rankings even when their graduates would go on to found entire new fields of history, science, or mathematics. As a general rule, if something related to American education is deemed good or better than, we're likely to see the presence of men with access to power. 

Keep in mind the colonial colleges were founded by men in power to prepare sons and their friend's sons access to the networks and knowledge they had, which means as women began to attend college in greater and greater numbers, it was about them gaining access to male spaces. As more and more students of color began going to college in the 1970s, especially those who attended Primarily White Institutes (PWIs), they were stepping into white spaces. Nearly all of the Colonial Colleges had their own quirky admissions exams until well into the 1900s. This meant that if a student wanted to attend Yale, he had to memorize a very particular set of Greek and Latin passages. And they could easily refuse to admit a young man of color or steer a young woman over to one of the Seven Sisters, the legacy women's colleges.

While the creation of the SAT exam was an attempt to even out admission policies among the ""best"" colleges, they all continued to give extra weight to legacy students. In effect, this was codifying the feedback loop I mentioned before. So, some schools are locked into performance on lists due to a combination of factors related to perception, exclusivity, and tradition. When ""ranking"" schools, publishers would look at how hard it was to get into, what graduates did after graduating, and other variables. In effect, it's not so much that newer colleges are kept from getting on to the list, it's more that the weight of tradition, exclusively, and access to power among those who've always been on the list has been too hard to overcome."
"Let me start by saying that my research was focused primarily on the armies because the myth itself is focused on the presence of black soldiers there specifically. Yes, the Confederate Navy also utilized enslaved men for various support roles, but they also employed free blacks in various capacities. One of the best examples is Robert Smalls, who worked as a boat ""captain"". He is best remembered for using a Confederate vessel to make his escape to the Union navy."
I've wondered the same thing about Virginia -- I feel like one of the first places to be settled by Europeans should have a bigger city to its name. Do you know the answer?
"I realize there aren’t really good analogies for wallet, keys, phone but there must have been other items that were very common to the time period/customs. I would think a water skin or snack items would be pretty common. Or you mention people of nobility, would it be a faux pas to be around the city or traveling without some items demonstrating their standing? Im not sure what those might be but some type of jewelry? Or movies often depict people wearing olive crown type of thing, im sure that may be an artistic liberty. I would also think bringing some type of coat or something to protect from possible rain since they couldn’t easily predict the weather and a knife or some type of fire starting material might also be common then. 

I realize much later a man would probably never leave his home without a hat, watch, some type of tobacco ie pipe. Would there be equivalent items for antiquity, obviously not watches. Maybe a religious relic or something?

Edit: some other items i thought of that were common at other times which may have an equivalent: lantern/torch, walking stick/cane, spare material for clothing repairs, pens/writing instrument, makeup for women, gloves, travel papers,"

">**At the time of US independence, the 13 colonies had 2+ million inhabitants, whereas the mother country, Britain, had only 8+ million.**

To be slightly more precise, the figures are probably 2,750,000 for the newly formed USA and about 7,5 million for Great Britain, excluding Ireland (around 4 million).

&#x200B;

>**How is it possible a colony could grow organically to 25% of home population in such a short time?**

That's mainly a matter of math. Essentially, it's a relatively small disparity between the birth rate and the mortality rate in the colonies which, over a period of about 150 years, resulted in marked growth. Whereas those figures in Britain remained much closer to one another and hence resulted in a less spectacular population increase.

1. **A higher birth and lower death rate**

The growth rate of the English colonies was remarkable. Especially in New England, which saw spectacular increases in population without the need for immigration. The annual population increase in New England exceeded the death rate by well over 3%. This might seem a small number, but figures like these are very significant when they're sustained over a long period of time because growth then effectively becomes exponential.

For example:

A population of 1,000 people (women) with a constant annual growth of 3% will result in a population figure of about 19,218 a century later;  which is an increase of well over 1800% compared to the initial 1000 people. Based on commonly cited estimates and without taking additional immigration into account, the 1780 US population had increased by less than that figure (increasing by about 1735%) over the preceding century. When accounting for immigration, an annual growth rate of 2.8% will easily get you from 151,500 colonists in 1680 to about 2,780,400 Americans in 1780.

To again stress the huge differences in outcome regarding these deceptively small figures: had the net growth rate been 3,5% instead of 3% the 1680 population would have resulted in 4,725,450 Americans in 1780; i.e. almost double its most probable historical estimate.

By comparison: the historical population of Britain is estimated at 6.5 million in 1680 and 7.5 million in 1780. This is a significant 15% increase, but a far slower growth rate than that of the Thirteen Colonies. The average birth rate and death rate largely  explain this. In the Thirteen Colonies the birth rate lay between 6.5 and 7.5 for much of the 17th century. Whereas the average total fertility rate in 17th century Britain was about 4.5 per woman. At the same time the average mortality rate in Britain (4.0-4.5 between 1640 and 1750) was much higher than that of the colonies, accounting for a slower level of growth prior to 1750.

In a large part, the discrepancy in death rates can be attributed to living conditions. 90% of Americans were farmers, living on countryside farms or small villages. Apart from a few port cities, urbanization within the American colonies was largely non-existent. In contrast, close to 35% of the British population lived in settlements with more than 2,500 inhabitants, with 15% of the total population living in cities of over 20,000 people. In general, for any period prior to the advent of modern sanitation and medicine, cities and large towns have a negative effect on the average health. It's hard to quantify this with solid examples, but one would be that of average height. A sample of British males (prisoners on their way to Australia) in 1780 showed the average height to be 5 feet 4 inches, whereas a sample of soldiers from the American Continental Amy in 1776 measured 5 feet 8 inches,  showing they were about 10 cm taller on average.

Poverty was also less of a factor in the ever expanding United States, with more than enough ""free"" land for sons of farmers to settle on; essentially providing a basic way of supporting oneself for everyone willing to work the land.

3. **Immigration**

American population growth was mainly, but not exclusively due to organic growth. Some 400,000 people immigrated (whether by their own choice, or not) to the Thirteen Colonies from Europe and Africa between 1700 and 1763. Even though immigrants, for most of the period prior to the American Revolution, never accounted for more than 10% of the population, they nevertheless contributed significantly to the ever expanding population base. Additionally, in the 17th century (when 85% of the immigrants came from Britain) these migrants slowed down population growth in Britain, though these effects had lessened by the 18th century, when less than 20% of the newly arriving immigrants were of British origins.

3. **Additional factors**

The period just following the initial colonization efforts in 1620-40 saw the start of the English Civil War, which (as a civil war) had a larger more negative impact on British population figures than a standard war; fought by abroad. Its overall impact on the population however, was still a relatively minor one.

&#x200B;

>**No other colonial power faced the same power disparity.**

Yes, but only when concerning the heritage of the settlers. Spain proper made up 42% of the total population of the Spanish Empire in 1800. By comparison, the Thirteen Colonies made up 'a mere' 27%  of the combined population of the colonies and Britain in 1780.

It is true, that the ethnic make up of the Spanish Empire was far more diverse/mixed than that of the English colonies and that they also included large percentages of native populations. The main factors in this difference in population composition are natural ones. The Spanish, for example, colonized latitudes with harsher climates and relatively more tropical diseases, for example malaria. The English colonies in North America, by comparison, were very similar to Britain itself; allowing for a rapid colonization by farmers and requiring far less adaptation in terms of agricultural methods. The same process, on a far smaller scale, can be observed in sub-Saharan Africa, which has no significant (genetically) European population beyond the descendants of the Dutch in South Africa; which is the only locality with a Europe-like climate."
"By faking, if you are referring to the 'Mask of Agamemnon' and the 'jewels of Helen' which he got his wife to famously model, it wasn't a case of faking and more not knowing the precise dating of these artefacts to correspond them to their respective figure in the Iliad. 

One could say Schliemann's greatest achievement (and terrible wanton destruction) was cutting down through the different layers at Troy and forming the first gathering of major archaeological evidence of the Trojan war occuring.  When corrobated with literary sources and other archaeological evidence, there's generally a match up to show that what he found was Trojan so to speak, just not from the right era. Which is a complete shame, as he probably destroyed so much evidence which could have been better preserved and studied today. (He cut down to the Second Layer of Troy (around 2600–2250 BCE), when the city which was attacked in the Iliad was in the 6th Layer. (1700-1500 BCE) All these layers are different settlements developed over time on the site and there are about 9 layers)

For example, Schliemann and Dörpfeld found the ruins of the temple of Athena at Troy which held trophies from the war, which we know Alexander The Great visited (Arrian, *Anabasis* 1.11.7-8). But you'd really have to point to later digs to demonstrate links between the Iliad and the site of Troy. Korfmann discovered a ditch cut into the bedrock in the lower settlement, possibly the front of a wooden stockade wall. In the *Iliad* at 7.433- 411, the Greeks ‘dug a trench, deep and wide, and in it planted stakes’ which was designed to protect their ships from the fire when they sacked the citadel. Also in the Iliad they made a mound of corpses and buried them just south of this ditch, and coincidentally a cemetery has also been discovered south of the ditch. So when we match up what's been discovered so far, we've been finding more and more evidence to demonstrate that Troy certainly did exist

I'd highly recommend reading Korfmann, who was head of the dig site at Troy and has found a lot of archaeological evidence that points towards Troys existence at the time of the Iliad and there being a war that led to the inspiration of the Iliad. It was just heavily romanticised and dramatised by Homer

"There wasn't a major difference in homesteading settlers between Montana and Alberta or neighboring Saskatchewan. The Oil Boom had a much bigger impact on population than the original homesteading. in 1921 Saskatchewan had a large prairie population of 757,510 compared to 588,454 in Alberta and 548,889 in Montana. 

Sask kept their lead until the 1940s until Alberta Oil and Gas took off. Alberta had over 15% growth every 5 years for 15 years, and never had less than 10% population growth **every 5 years** from 1941 to present with the exception 1986-1996 which still boasted 5%. In contrast after 1940 the population of Saskatchewan which has mainly stayed agricultural with a much smaller oilfield has maintained a population of 900k - 1Million since 1931, with a drop in the 40s and 50s with the decline of interest in uranium deposits.
Montana I'm less familiar about but while Both Alberta and Sask grew 20% between 1921-1931, Montana actually had a 2% decrease. This put them at a significant population disadvantage, and while they had modest growth better than Sask the average growth was only ~5% **every 10 years.**

Excellent breakdown. Thank you for your detailed response
"Only one ship sank during the Battle of Trafalgar itself, the French 74-gun ship *Achille*. *Achille* joined various other French and Spanish ships in engaging the British *Bellisle*. However, at 3:30 pm, she received a raking broadside from *Swiftsure*, which then drew up along her port side and began a short-range engagement. Meanwhile, her starboard side was engaged by *Polyphemus*. At about 4pm, she was engaged by the 98-gun *Prince*. An early broadside brought down *Achille*'s mainmast, and started a fire in the fore-top. Her crew began to cut away the foremast to prevent the fire spreading to the rest of the ship. As they did so, *Prince*'s next broadside brought the mast down, letting the fire spread, and in an unfortunate coincidence, smashing the ship's fire engine (mobile pump). With no way to prevent the fire spreading to the rest of the ship, her commanding officer ordered her seacocks opened, and ordered his crew to abandon ship. The British ships surrounding her moved away, to avoid being caught in the inevitable explosion when the fire reached her magazine, but began to lower their boats to rescue as many of her crew as possible. Two small British vessels, *Pickle* and *Entreprenante*, attached to Nelson's force as dispatch vessels, joined the rescue efforts, moving in close to the burning hulk to pick up men from the water. Some two-three hundred men (and at least one woman) were rescued from the water before, at about 5:30, *Achille* blew up in a spectacular explosion.

The remaining ships that sank as a result of Trafalgar sank in the days after the battle. The British had captured 17 French and Spanish ships in the battle, all heavily damaged. As the prize crews, often assisted by the French and Spanish prisoners, fought to bring the ships back to a British port, a gale blew up. The storm would blow for five days, from the 22nd to the 27th October. Many of the prizes had been heavily damaged, missing masts and rigging, and with crews depleted by battle casualties. Several foundered, slowly sinking as they were overwhelmed by the weather. As they did so, the British sent boats to take off the men aboard, both the British prize crews and French/Spanish prisoners. *Redoutable*, for example, was evacuated by the British *Swiftsure*, which had been helping to tow her. As *Redoutable* began to founder, *Switftsure*'s boats were dispatched to take off those aboard *Redoutable*; several trips were made, but the weather made things difficult, and *Redoutable* would ultimately succumb to the waves with 200 men aboard. Three of the captured ships, *Bucentaure*, *Aigle* and *Algéciras*, lost contact with the British fleet. Aboard them, the prisoners rose up, recovering the ships from the numerically inferior prize crews. Algéciras successfully returned to Cadiz, but the other two ships would be wrecked on the Spanish coast. Many aboard *Aigle* would be lost to the sea, but those aboard *Bucentaure* would be rescued by French warships. This included the British prize crew, commanded by a Lieutenant Richard Spear. The prize crew were treated with dignity, and were returned to the British fleet soon afterwards, under a flag of truce. "
"Just a habit. Anglophone authors mostly use the latinising form of the name (Socrates). I prefer the hellenising spelling (Sokrates) since it's closer to the original Greek (Σωκράτης). You can see the letter kappa (κ) in there, which is the origin of the letter k in our alphabet.

"Really, your question answers another commonly asked question: why didn't the Fellowship fly to Mordor with the Eagles? Simple. They were writing and recording one of the greatest songs of all time. 

Gandalf was their manager at the time, and after meeting with the Eagles after Orthanc, he gave them the idea for the song. Hotel California is actually about Saruman imprisoning Gandalf. (""You can check out anytime...but you can never leave"")

Rescuing Frodo and Sam was only a PR stunt orchestrated by Gandalf before the release of their album to gain publicity. In fact, some experts believe Hotel California would not have been as popular if the Eagles had not saved the ring bearer.

"After further research, I will add as an aside that while monarchs in Europe definitely had guards around this time, the move in the U.S. toward greater protection of its leaders over the second half of the 19th Century was a worldwide trend, even among those who already had guards.

This time period saw the rise of anarchist movements and other dissidents, some of whom believed in the concept of [""propaganda of the deed""](http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws55_prop_deed.html) — the idea that an assassination of a (definitionally illegitimate and oppressive) leader would do far more to bring support to your cause than merely publishing a pamphlet. McKinley's assassin was an anarchist, but worldwide a number of heads of state, including Emperor Napoleon III and several Russian tsars, faced assassination attempts in this period — some successful.

From the book ""[Royal Murders: Hatred, Revenge and the Seizing of Power](https://books.google.com/books?id=q50TDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT172&lpg=PT172&dq=queen+victoria's+bodyguards&source=bl&ots=O_pEbS0D2L&sig=K3MvwMV4IxqiWmbwBA3wgKUPSAg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxm_eGuaTTAhUCw4MKHYKhAf0Q6AEIlwEwGA#v=onepage&q=queen%20victoria's%20bodyguards&f=false)"": 

> The years 1898-1914 were the heyday of the anarchist assassin... By the last decade of the nineteenth century, the monarchs of Europe were closely guarded. The attempts on the lives of three of them in 1878 and the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 had reinforced the conviction that there must be a huge investment of men, money and effort in protecting 'crowned heads'. 

It was in these years that Scotland Yard created its Special Branch"" to ""undertake surveillance of those suspected of subversive activities *and also to act as bodyguards to members of the British royal family and of foreign royal families visiting Britain*"" (emphasis added). 

The first two presidential assassinations *could* be dismissed, if people were so inclined, as one-off events — one tied to the now-past turmoil of the Civil War and the other mentally unstable. McKinley's death was *ideologically motivated* and it's not too surprising that this — in conjunction with assassination attempts on other world leaders around this time — was the final straw that led to permanent, full-time protection of presidents."

"Thank you for the excellent answer. I have a follow up question if I may?

If I understand your answer correctly the modern system of hereditary surnames became fixed much earlier than I had imagined: between 1300 and 1450.

If I have understood this correctly I’m surprised that the profession-based names we have today (eg smith, baker, thatcher, cook, etc) all use the same Modern English terminology and indeed spelling that we would use today. I wouldn’t have expected this if the surnames became fixed as names distinct from professions during the Middle English period.

Have I misunderstood the timing or have surnames evolved with the language (eg today’s Mr Miller might have originally been a Mr Myllere)?

When did the actual spellings become fixed? Such that Miller, Milner and Myller began to denote different families?"

"Everyone! A note is necessary here. There is roughly a single fact that people know about mid-century accents, namely the existence of the ""Mid-Atlantic"" accent. [There is a nice old post about them on this subreddit even](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5secpc/why_did_all_announcers_from_the_1930s_and_1940s/ddex41k/) We have removed a bajillion comments which have responded to this question explaining it is the answer.

Anyone who is claiming this is the Mid-Atlantic accent is only helping to demonstrate exactly why we maintain such a strict level of quality control here, because you are demonstrating how *incorrect* answers can easily become so dominant as a response without it. The style of speech in question is *not* what one might find in 1930s films like *Bringing Up Baby*. It is what you would find in 1950s sitcoms, something like *I Love Lucy* or *The Honeymooners*. 

If you are able to discuss *that* style of speech with the necessary level of depth and comprehensiveness, we really look forward to your well-crafted response.

"One thing to note in the quote from the quote you shared out of the CBS handbook: most censor boards. Take note of the plural.

Today, we take for granted that movies and such are just rated (in the G, PG, PG-13, R sense). This system—as a united national system—doesn’t come about until 1968 in the US. Before that, there was a hodgepodge of local and national censorship boards (the national ones I know of were religiously affiliated—the wonderfully titled [National Legion of Decency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Legion_of_Decency) was Catholic affiliated, for example). They could boycott and otherwise economically punish “indecent” movie studios, and in some areas were even able to effectively block screenings of risqué movies. I’m not quite sure they had that power over the airwaves, but they certainly could be a headache for television (or radio) stations if they wanted. 

Because there wasn’t one clear standard by these censorship groups (this was pre-ratings, so as far as I’m aware the boards would mainly just declare a movie acceptable or not—our friends the National Legion of Decency I believe had two ratings C/Condemned and B/Partially Objectionable, A/Morally Unobjectionable), film studios and later television studios had to scramble to fit what they thought was likely to get passed even the more conservative local boards. This lead to a lot of voluntary self-censorship. In the film industry, this was codified as [the Hays Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code) (officially “the Motion Picture Production Code”). The industry definitely didn’t want outside government censorship but since unpredictable local censorship hurt business, these self-censoring moves by the industry were an attempt to have at least predictable, industry controlled self-regulation—which often meant to taking (as in the case with the word “pregnancy”) very conservative stances even when it wasn’t really necessary. 

Television was produced outside the Hays Code, but it still cast its shadow, and the television industry also wanted to avoid the ire of local censorship boards (which even at that point still existed in many places). Only in 1952 did the Supreme Court Rule in *Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson* (overturning an earlier decision) that films even had First Amendment freedom of speech protections, weakening then existing government censorship (this case involved New York State’s Board of Regents not permitting a short film to be exhibited). Official government (either state or municipal) boards continued to challenge these rules through the 1950’s and private citizen groups stuck around even longer—the National League of Decency only shut its doors in 1980. 

We take for granted that there’s one national rating system for movies, TV, music, video games, etc, but these are fairly recent (1968, 1996, 1985, 1994, respectively, as far as I’m aware). Before that, the industry had to fear backlash from dozens of local boards and organizations, many of which didn’t even distinguish media made for children and media made for adults. This uncertainty could lead to conservative standards as a business decision guaranteeing the widest audience."

"> before 1957 very few Americans believed the mafia even existed. J Edgar Hoover had even actively denied its existence

This is honestly quite surprising to me. Probably because of movies like The Godfather, it seemed like organized crime was a serious issue. Was it just that their crimes were contained to the ""underworld"" and didn't impact the general public?

What finally convinced the American public the mafia existed? And why would Hoover want to deny its existence?"

"Eighteenth-century British North America isn't one of the three places you identified, but I suspect this will be interesting to you and others.

To understand wealth in eighteenth-century America, historians often use tax lists. Their study of them hasn't been comprehensive, but has in many cases focused on large port cities (which aren't necessarily representative of the rest of the continent). These tax lists are a bit quirky. They weren't produced every year, or even every decade. Only a few have survived. They don't necessarily account for all of an individual's wealth, because some folks were very good at hiding wealth from tax assessors. Moreover, they tend to only count heads of household or individuals with property (usually white men, sometimes widows, never enslaved people). 

With those limitations in mind, what historians have found is that if you divide these tax lists into brackets, those at the top did own an extremely high proportion of the wealth, particularly in the late eighteenth century. I haven't found any analysis that breaks this down into the ""top 1%,"" unfortunately, but here is how historian Gary Nash breaks down several tax lists from colonial British North America:

1693 Philadelphia tax list:

* 0-30% bracket: 2.2% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 15.2% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 36.6% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 46.0% of wealth (13.2% in 91-95% bracket, 32.8% in 96-100% bracket)

1730 New York City tax list:

* 0-30% bracket: 6.2% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 13.9% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 36.5% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 43.7% of wealth (14.2% in 91-95% bracket, 25.4% in 96-100% bracket)

1767 Philadelphia tax list: 

* 0-30% bracket: 1.8% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 5.5% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 27.0% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 65.7% of wealth (16.2% in 91-95% bracket, 49.5% in 96-100% bracket)

1771 Boston tax list:

* 0-30% bracket: 0.1% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 9.1% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 27.4% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 63.4% of wealth (14.7% in 91-95% bracket, 48.7% in 96-100% bracket)

1774 Philadelphia tax list: 

* 0-30% bracket: 1.1% of wealth

* 31-60% bracket: 4% of wealth

* 61-90% bracket: 22.6% of wealth

* 91-100% bracket: 72.3% of wealth (16.8% in 91-95% bracket, 55.5% in 96-100% bracket)

While there are definitely limits to what this tells us, as I noted above, these numbers are a pretty powerful indication that there was, at least, a high concentration of wealth at the top end of urban society in eighteenth-century British North America—and that this concentration probably rose over the course of the eighteenth century. If you look at the top 10% bracket in Philadelphia, this rung of society went from owning 46% of wealth in 1693 to owning 72.3% in 1774. Compare that top 10% bracket to today, where (in 2013) the top 10% of families owned 76% of wealth. That's not so far off.

The 1774 Philadelphia tax list is particularly interesting to me, because it came just two years before the Declaration of Independence was signed in the same city. The enormous wealth stratification at the time, and the fact that many of the delegates who signed onto the notion that ""All men are created equal"" likely belonged to the top 10% of society, really sets that document into a different context.  

So what does this tell us? For me, it's an indication that industrialization cannot be regarded as the sole cause of wealth concentration. Having studied these tax lists, I can tell you that the wealthiest individuals in these societies tended to be merchants (with some exceptions). Just as in today's case where people can make huge fortunes through Wall Street and big banks, commerce and speculation were some of the main ways that individuals accumulated enormous amounts of wealth in the eighteenth century.

"I cannot write a properly sourced answer without doing additional research into this specific topic, but what I want to communicate in **very broad strokes** is that the article oversimplifies things a great deal — especially considering that Soviet health resorts themselves, as architectural objects, are so widely known, depicted, and talked about today.

- To get this out of the way right away: sanatorium / health resort vacations weren't mandatory. People were not expected to always spend their vacations there, nor were they forced to partake in any other organized vacationing. At most, you could call it peer pressure if a group from one's job went, or your number in line came up (see below).

- The 1922 decree, as you may guess, was not a way to forcibly coerce people to stay at resorts, but an idealized milestone to strive for. **In fact, the decree itself says nothing about a two-week vacation or that workers must (or rather *should*) be necessarily be able to visit sanatoriums: [it just orders the necessary efforts for establishing this system of workers' resorts in Crimea using existing infrastructure](https://dr-manshina.blogspot.com/2017/08/21-1920.html) (link includes a scan).** If anything, even with all existing Pre-Revolutionary spas, resorts, mansions, and hotels in Crimea repurposed for this aim, the peninsula wasn't quite big enough to host the entire Soviet Union's workforce every year. *(You also mixed up the ""half a million"" figure in the title: it was all of the thousands of sanatoriums in USSR, not just one. The USSR's population post-war ranged from 170 to 290 million).*

- The two-week vacation itself was mandated by labor rights, similar to the 8-hour workday. That right was indeed quite stringently protected — like in many other government-regulated areas, there was a lot of stability and safe predictability (if not always quality) in basic arrangements of one's life the Soviet Union: living space, job security, pensions, healthcare and so on.

- Health resorts, which sanatoriums were, were simply an option that you could exercise through some official organizations. You needed to obtain a ticket, based on quotas, priorities, and queues stemming from quotas. They indeed were officially healthcare facilities, and tried to enforce a daily regimen, wholesome (if bland) diet, and various invigorating or therapeutic procedures on their guests; the guests generally accepted this pampering and dutifully underwent the therapy, but had leeway in how serious they took the ""medical"" side of the vacation. In any case, it was a very regimented affair, more akin to a preventative hospital stay, so ""jam-packed"" sanatoriums were not.

- Now, how would a worker get an organized vacation, like a trip to sanatorium or a regular workers' resort (дом отдыха, ""recuperation house"")? Again, in broad strokes: you came to work, the word got around that spots in a (say, N Health Resort) are open for applications, you applied. Maybe you fit the quota right away, or you had to wait in line for some (long) time. The tickets/quotas could be from your union (this was where sanatorium vacations were distributed), or your company/factory, or some other org. 

- Some resorts were patronized (and even built) by specific large organizations, so you needed to be in the corporation to get a ticket. Others were for general worker population, depending on how the unions distributed them (so it could of course depend on some social capital, nepotism, favors, just luck). There were exclusive resorts built by and reserved for large orgs like major industrial firms or ministries, but also just regular ones for regular laborers.

- It might be simpler to visualize a sanatorium if we also mention pioneer summer camps. Basically, it's a boy/girl scout camp, there are tickets that are available form your school or your factory or social services etc. etc. (see above), you work out dates during the summer recess, get your son/daughter on a train, forget about them for several weeks =) Point is, the opportunity is presented to you through your social circle or local announcement, and it has grounds that you're not supposed to leave, unless on a field trip or sneaking out. Oh, and just in case: not all (to put it mildly) summer camps, resorts, or sanatoriums were in Crimea, or sea-side.

- Still, going back to the gist of my answer, many, if not most Soviet people simply spent vacations as people do. They sat at home watching TV or reading or making hobby crafts, tinkered with their prized automobile, went for a country or mountain hike with friends or with a tourist club, spent time in their hobby club, flew to another city to visit relatives, or went on a alcohol bender with friends or alone... 

- Specifically Soviet options were to go to their dacha (a small country house with a garden), or to a village where they had a house / relatives or friends with a house, and spend their vacation walking, swimming, picking berries and mushrooms, and doing country stuff around the house like splitting wood and gardening. Some were also avid hunters, who went on hunting trips (shotguns mostly though, apart from higher management, forest rangers, prospectors, and the military; rifles weren't sold in sporting stores during post-war Soviet era, you had to have access to them otherwise).

But yes, there was a push to grant women the right to vote to continue LDS domination of elections, especially since Brigham Young feared waves of outsiders flooding Utah after the transcontinental railroad was finished. Young also developed programs to get converts naturalized as quickly as possible so they could vote and maintain a Mormon bloc, especially in the face of efforts to disenfranchise polygamists. And that's why I say it's complicated (and Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's book on this is wonderful): Women did have a lot more empowerment in Utah than they might elsewhere, but it was granted to them by men for a specific purpose. Those women were able to use that power to their advantage, sometimes in ways the men did not anticipate. The women's Relief Society, disbanded by Young and then allowed by him to reform, also gave women some autonomy. But, as these things always are, it was messy given that men could intervene and restrict that power and autonomy."

"Basically, because of Byzantium. 

Let's start with a thought experiment. Imagine that the Western Roman Empire survived for another thousand years. Maybe Adrianopole went the other way; maybe one of the fifth-century emperors managed to stop the parade of civil wars that ruined the state. We might imagine all sorts of political scenarios - a strong and centralized Empire, a Roman commonwealth, etc. - but we can be sure of one thing: the Western Empire would have used Latin to the bitter end. Spoken Latin would probably still have evolved in the direction of the Romance languages; but since the imperial elite would have continued to uphold the Classical standard as the only ""correct"" form of Latin, the change would have been much slower. And since there would have been only a single reference point for linguistic correctness, the Romance languages themselves – in the sense of recognized and prestigious alternatives to Latin – would never have come into existence.

This scenario was played out in the Eastern Roman Empire, which of course did survive its western counterpart by nearly a thousand years. As the political and social structures that maintained a single standard of Latin fell apart in the west, the structures that upheld the unity of Greek endured. There was of course always variation in the use of Greek, and all sorts of local dialects. But there was only one standard - or rather, as we'll see, two closely allied standards - for ""good"" Greek, and that remained the case as long as the Eastern Empire endured. 

By the first century CE, Greek was the lingua franca of the Eastern Mediterranean, spoken by cultural and political elites in a great sweeping arc from Bulgaria to Libya. It was the language of the majority only in the Greek peninsula, western Asia Minor, and a few areas of heavy colonization. Elsewhere - in Syria, in Palestine, in Egypt - it was the language of the cities that Greek colonists and Hellenistic kings had scattered along the near the coast. 

The Greek language, famously, was never monolithic. In the Classical era, there were several major dialects, all mutually intelligible but markedly different in sound. Though originally regional (Doric Greek dialects were mostly spoken in the Peloponnese, Ionic in the islands of the Aegean and along the coast of Asia Minor), the dialects also became artificial literary standards, with authors using (variants of) one or another in different genres. In keeping with the economic and (especially) cultural importance of Athens, the Attic dialect became increasingly prominent, both in literature and (apparently) in common use. The vast expansion of the Greek world during the Hellenistic period and the Hellenistic canonization of Athenian literature as the golden standard of Hellenic cultural achievement cemented the ascendancy of Attic as the most prestigious form of Greek. In everyday usage, Attic became the basis of the ""common"" or Koine dialect, the Greek used in the teeming new cities of the Hellenistic world.

By the first century, Koine was the spoken standard across the Greek-speaking world. It had also become the accepted variety for written works with no literary pretensions - including, famously, the Christian New Testament. The standards for high-style literary composition, however, was still Attic. The Greek cultural revival known as the Second Sophistic fetishized a hyper-correct form of Classical Attic. (The second-century author Lucian has one work in which he profusely apologizes for using a non-Attic greeting when he met a friend, and another, comedic treatise in which the letter sigma sues the letter tau in court for encroaching on his syllabic territory.) 

The dual standard of imperial Greek - Koine in everyday use, Attic in literary contexts - survived into late antiquity and beyond. The Byzantine Empire retained, if only in Constantinople, the essentials of the Roman educational system, founded on memorization and imitation of a small canon of ancient masterpieces. Although spoken Greek drifted steadily away, shifting its sounds and simplifying its syntax, literature continued to be written in stylized Koine or the author’s best stab at Attic, and the unchallenged prestige of the ancient models prevented a rupture between literary and vernacular usage. 

The area in which Greek was spoken contracted rapidly in the early Middle Ages. The Islamic conquests stripped Byzantium of its eastern territories, and Arabic swiftly replaced Greek as the language of prestige and culture in Syria and Egypt. The Slavic incursions drove deep in the Balkans, driving Greek-speakers into scattered enclaves. By the time the smoke cleared in the ninth century, Greek was spoken only in parts of Sicily and southern Italy, the Greek peninsula, and Asia Minor. 

The Greek spoken in the smaller, medieval Eastern Empire was quite different from either Attic or Koine (by the eleventh century, in fact, it seems to have sounded much like modern Greek). But thanks to the enduring strength - or if you like, inertia - of the ancient standard upheld by the Byzantine court and educational system, the spoken forms had no prestige. A language, famously, is a dialect with an army and a navy; and Byzantium represented the single recognized source of political and cultural authority within the Greek-speaking world. 

The Greek language, in short, was saved from developing into multiple languages by the persistence of the Eastern Roman Empire and its schools, which continued to endorse ancient paradigms of “good” Greek. Thanks to the Greek Orthodox Church and Greek nationalism, this dynamic survived Byzantium itself."
"To add a bit more to what's already been explained by /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov and /u/Snapshot52, it is worth stressing that American schools have a fair amount of responsibility for his prominence. 

The American common school movement used a number of Protestant touchstones as it took shape in the mid-1800s. This included things like having boys and girls in class together, religious texts in early primers and readers, and routines and celebrations. 

While some schools started off the day with prayers and religious songs, others moved into more secular celebrations of holidays, seasons, and Americana (a term that refers to songs, texts, ideas, and people associated with the United States. It includes things like Franklin an his key and the mnemonic ditty, ""In fourteen-hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue."") Early history textbooks would give lip service to the Indigenous people on this soil before colonizers arrived, but generally stated the timeline of America in 1492 and the arrival of Columbus and his ships. (That he didn't really land in the states and where he thought he was often deliberately left out of the narrative. A key feature of Americana is simple narratives and ideas that can be communicated easily to children.) 

From an older response of mine:
> Americana can best be thought of as the packaging of American history and touchstones for the next generation. It's a framework that led to the Washington and the cherry tree genre of stories, generations of school children memorizing the preamble to the Constitution, learning Christopher Columbus ""discovered"" American and mass dislocation and genocide of Indigenous people was simply ""manifest destiny"", and other broad strokes about what happened on this soil. This simplistic approach to American history was embedded in the texts children read and the way teachers talked about history. ... This meant that the 400th anniversary [of his landing] was everything. Schools across the country were planning celebrations, not because they coordinated, but because celebrations of events related to Americana was something you did in American schools. 

In 1892, a poet to put to paper and created a special poem to commemorate Columbus' landing. His ""pledge"" was taken by children around the country and forever entwined the name of Columbus with this notion of America. In [my response](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/eztjvl/when_did_american_schools_start_saying_the_pledge/fgso4nu/) to the question, *When did American schools start saying the pledge every day?* I go into more depth about the relationship between Columbus and the pledge.

All of which is to say, Americana - as disseminated in American schools - stripped Columbus of his context, put him at the front of the list of Great American men, and let history and collective memory do the rest."

I can provide a partial answer from a legal history perspective.

Those fifty-odd years between the Eighteenth Amendment and the War on Drugs witnessed one of the most important transformations in American legal history: the advent of the modern, federalized administrative state.

First, a bit of background. Today, Americans are used to the Federal government being involved in the day-to-day affairs of states and individuals. From regulating seatbelts and energy prices to mandating masks during a global pandemic, the federal government is involved. More than two million people play their part in this great administrative machine. The federal administrative state is so influential that it is referred to as the Fourth Branch of the government. 

This is a relatively modern state of affairs. If you took high school civics in the U.S., you probably remember the federal government is limited to ""enumerated powers"" and the states or people have everything else. As understood by the First Congress, direct federal power seems to have been read very narrowly. The only branch of the federal government they set up that might regularly interact with everyday American life was the post office.

Direct federal intervention in the lives of people remained fairly small. The first count of civilian federal employees happened shortly after the War of 1812. It tabulated less than five thousand employees. Federal courts regularly met in the post office rather than in their own buildings (the Supreme Court itself did not get its own building until 1935). Even where federal law applied, it was often enforced by *state* courts.

The exact date of birth of the federal administrative state is likely going to be debated by legal historians forever. But a solid argument can be made for the Civil War. The Freedmen's Bureau, born in the crisis of the Civil War and Reconstruction, was the first major federal agency to regulate the details of every day life. Bureau agents scattered across the south maintained order, made and broke contracts, released people on bail, oversaw cases, and more. This novel federal intervention into the lives of individuals was authorized under the war powers and the new Reconstruction Amendments (the 13th, 14th, and 15th). The Bureau was always viewed as a temporary, emergency measure and even in that context, was highly controversial. Congress sunset the Bureau in the early 1870s. 

Starting in the late 1880s, Congress began seriously developing the administrative state again. For now though, federal agents typically kept to traditional areas of federal regulation. For example, the 1887 Interstate Commerce Commission handled disputes between railroads and set interstate shipping rates. (The Constitution directly gives Congress the power to regulate such interstate activities so the use was fairly uncontroversial).

Second, with that established, we can turn to part of the main question: why did Prohibition need the Eighteenth Amendment? Because was a dramatic break with prior understandings of where and how federal power could be exercised.

By the time the Eighteenth Amendment was ratified in 1919, most states had passed some form of laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol and it was firmly settled they had the power to do so. The controversy was the *federal* government stepping into this area of traditional state power and centralizing it in Washington.

One contemporary commentator described it nicely, ""Men did not seem so much impressed by the fact that the individual was totally deprived of his right to decide for himself what he would drink as the fact that the jurisdiction of the states was to be reduced."" JOHN BURGESS, RECENT CHANGES IN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY 87–88 (1923) (quoted in Post, infra, note 7).

Prohibition, as enforced by the 1919 Volstead Act, made the federal government's rule supreme in an area of traditional state jurisdiction. In doing so, the federal government agents once again began intervening directly in every day affairs. By 1920, the Prohibition Bureau was up and running and federal agents began raiding speakeasies across the country. This time, unlike the Bureau agents, the intervention was intended to be permanent.

Finally, the last part of your question: why did the War on Drugs not require a Constitutional Amendment? Simply put, federal intervention into everyday affairs of traditional state jurisdiction became normal. The federal administrative state and the laws supporting it ballooned during the Great Depression.

By 1970, the federal government both was used to reaching into traditional state areas of regulation and had built up the administrative apparatus to do so. At the same time, federal criminal law had come of age with a growing number of federal crimes being codified. Approximately half of federal crimes came into being *after* 1970.

In short, by the time the War on Drugs was declared, it was no longer controversial for the federal government to step in and dominate an area traditionally associated with the powers of the states.

"Wow. Great answer. I had no idea.

Are there any commonalities between Liberia and other countries over the past few hundred years with that ""oppressed becoming the oppressor"" kind of dynamic?

Like, is this a unique thing or does it happen regularly? I'm thinking about how people abused as children will frequently. Become abusers themselves. Seems like similar behaviour played about on a political scale."

"As I understand, Russian surnames [had an incredible variety](https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/stanovlenie-instituta-russkih-i-frantsuzskih-familiy-istoriya-i-sravnenie/viewer) of sources. First the feudal lords' and nobles (nicknames, patronyms, or names of their fiefdoms), then the invented ""sophisticated-sounding"" surnames of priests (done in imitation of this privileged practice). Then the peasant surnames, made from patronyms and nicknames (according to the paper above, in 1897, 75% of people who responded to the first census still didn't have a surname as we know it!).

And it's amazing how universal the mocking/humorous public nickname business was, basically there wasn't any people at all who didn't have one, judging by documents (actual XVI c. archive records that list people as, say, ""Guba son of Mikifor, nickname Crooked Cheeks, free peasant"", or Danilo the Snot, peasant). And even by [this paper](https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/derevenskie-prozvischa-k-voprosu-o-haraktere-bytovanii-i-sotsialnyh-funktsiyah-po-polevym-materialam-belozerskogo-r-na-vologodskoy/viewer) that researched a real living village in the field in the early 21 century!

> ...also, near nobody lived without a nickname. Everyone had a nickname. <...> So many nicknames, all different, in each village. <...> That's how it was back in the day, it wasn't any more in my time. People ridiculed each other in all sorts of ways. 

And still, the researchers recorded about 100 actual, used nicknames for living people. The oldest villagers even remembered an old practice of songs and rhymes (ustavleniya) that fixed these nicknames both for individual people and for dwellers of neighbouring villages collectively. And also served as entertainment, sort of roasting sessions / rap battles, and mnemonic devices."
"There is already an excellent answer provided by the Thane of Cawdor (great username) but I wanted to pitch in from a different angle. I do a PhD in History of Art but specifically on the use of music in a particular 19th-century movement, when popular concert halls and orchestral venues became a large-scale phenomenon for the first time. By large-scale I mean, anyone could go and music took on a different role in Victorian London. There was one painter, raised in industrial Birmingham, never heard a proper orchestra before, who - upon his first experience - thought he was witnessing the 'Day of Creation'. He was also deeply religious at the time, but it struck me how the experience of music at that time and place (Victorian era) generated a quasi-religious experience.

It is also very true that orchestral performances were commonly loud, raucous, far from the revered silence-attitude we're used to today. That was first introduced in the early- to mid-19th century following the popularity of classical instrumental music coming from composers like Beethoven, Haydn, Schubert, Mozart, etc. The shift from social entertainment to independent artwork, to be appreciated as is, led to a shift from noise to revered silence. New concert halls were being constructed (St James's Hall, 1858; Handel Festivals and Saturday Concerts at the Crystal Palace from 1855 onwards; the Hallé Orchestra, 1857; London Philharmonic Society, 1813; Royal Albert Hall, 1878) were built to be such shrines of culture and classical music, dedicated entirely to this new style of appreciating music. I've noticed that, among those artists who were already religiously inclined, their responses to orchestral performances - and I mean large-scale ones, of c. 100 musicians - were decidedly religious. Specifically performances of Beethoven's symphonies were considered to be transcendent, mystical, and divine, an approach modelled on the original German Romantic response to Beethoven's music (specifically E.T.A. Hoffmann in 1810).

There was an easy connection between the impact of a large-scale orchestra and overwhelming sensory experiences, but not everyone interpreted it that way. My research focuses heavily on musical immersion and the artists I work on were mostly interested in colour-music, tonal relations, formal harmony, and the impact on the senses. That being said, these are artists, not every person on the street (though most of these artists did start off as kids in poor industrial families). There was definitely a large sense of wonder that many could see as religious, but others saw as purely sensuous. I think for many religion did provide the rhetoric to interpret these sensations, at least in the nineteenth century (many responses to Wagner's music; H.R. Haweis in London; revivals of Early Music in Oxford student societies in the 1840s and 1850s)."

"Yes, but in terms of cultural impact I think you might want to zoom out and look at the two cities from a purely physical perspective.  To add to what /u/Mictlantecuhtli said from a more Roman perspective:

You can walk through the  Colosseum today and stand where the gladiatorial combats took place two millennia ago.  You can stand below the Arch of Constantine and see the same untouched sculpture and inscriptions almost as they were in ancient times.  The ruins that were repurposed or built over were often preserved to a significant extent and certainly weren't razed to destroy the ancient past - visit the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels and the Martyrs in Rome and you can still see a tremendous amount of the Baths of Diocletian remaining.  The whole city proclaims its ancient legacy at a glance and has always done so, even to the uneducated or illiterate who might not fully understand or place the ruins in context.

There's no equivalent of that in Mexico City at all.  The geography carries echoes of the past, but the recognizable physical entity of Tenochtitlan as it existed prior to the conquest was pretty much eradicated.  You can see digs and foundations, or visit museums and see artifacts, or travel outside the city and see real structures, but just walking through Mexico city without any prior knowledge you will not really see any evidence of the pre-conquest city.

I actually  think that it might be worth making a comparison to a different ""Roman"" capital that saw a very different historical trajectory compared Rome itself - Istanbul.  Constantinople remained ""Roman"" far more recently than Rome itself in a lot of ways and matched the Eternal City in size and architecture, yet the physical reality of the city today is far less obviously Roman.  While there's still a much more obvious physical record of Roman civilization in Istanbul than Mexica civilization in Mexico city, it's still an example of another culture forcibly establishing itself in a way that never really happened to Rome.  There are Roman ruins, but they are smaller and you have to look to find them or have been significantly changed.  Besides the walls, which are... walls, and not really cultural artifacts to the same extent as other ruins, the Roman legacy isn't *visible* in the same way it is in Rome.  Much of what has been preserved was significantly changed by the Ottomans.  There are certainly still plenty of buildings standing and if you look you can find lots of smaller preserved bits of Byzantine Constantinople, but the city doesn't feel Roman in the same way."

"Treatment was limited. There was a consideration of performing trephination (opening the skull to relieve pressure) but the physicians decided against it. In retrospect it likely would not have helped. This is Vesalius' clinical summary and autopsy report for those interested. 

""Despite the fact that the left eye was immensely swollen, it retained full vision, indicating that there had not been a breakdown of the nervous force. The bone of the skull in the frontal region appeared completely uninjured and intact although there was an oedematous swelling of the forehead. The superior part of the nasal bone was not at all bare and had suffered from contusion rather than abrasion. The external side of the socket of the right eye was completely denuded of membrane and was rough. Its innermost and posterior aspect still contained a large number of splinters which, like stakes, had been driven in a kind of circle which chiefly occupied a position between the socket and the lower aspect of the eye. Their tips had penetrated the hard covering of the eye so that small splinters extended into it from as far as the superior part of the socket and the anterior region of the eye, which otherwise seemed uninjured and intact in content and appearance.
The membranes of the brain and the brain itself at the forehead and at the right socket of the eye, which one might believe could have been preserved only by extraordinary chance, appeared quite unharmed, and the dural membrane appeared everywhere uninjured. But the membrane attached to it somewhat posteriorly at the vertex had a yellowish color for the length of one finger, the width of two, and the depth of a thumb. The whole of the left part was observed to be filled with a serous ichor-like fluid which flowed away as if the whole had recently been affected by putrefaction or some sort of gangrene.
In the region where the suppuration occurred, the dural membrane was observed to have vessels more distended and blackish than elsewhere, but between this structure and the skull there was some grumous blood. The skull and the skin that, as may already have been conjectured, had been scraped off, showed nothing abnormal, although at some time, as a scar indicated, the king had been wounded there. Thus the putrid condition gave proof that the brain had collided with the skull and had been concussed and shocked by it, and not that the condition had been caused by an injury to the skull.""

"Okay, finally a question that I'm probably one of the few people qualified to answer. My historical background is just a BA and MA in history, writing primarily on US Army Air Force bombing campaigns in WWII, with particular attention to targeting of civilians - I know, not what we're talking about, but just letting you know I'm one of you but am writing a bit outside of my academic wheelhouse. Professionally, I am an Air Force pilot and have flown against Soviet era AAA and SAM systems across the world, admittedly mostly against ancient ones with poorly trained operators. I will make sure I don't violate rule 4 with ""personal/anecdotal"" experience by backing myself up with sources, which is good practice anyways because if I write about stuff that I do at work, I need to make sure it's already on there so I don't embarrass [myself like this.](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/18/classified-details-of-armys-challenger-tank-leaked-via-video-game) 

**Caveat**: My training in counter SAMs / SEAD (suppression of enemy air defenses) began in 2014, not 1986, and even then, it was the basics - I don't specialize in it, I don't fly F-35s or F-16CJs like my [Wild Weasel brethren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Weasel) that live for this. I'm using old copies of [Jane's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janes_Information_Services), which are available to me through a subscription I have from work - these are not classified, but are behind a paywall. Jane's has been the gold standard of quantifying and comparing military equipment across pretty much every category - aircraft, planes, weapons, etc, and has been since the late 19th century. The oldest copy of it that I've touched in a 1898 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships in the stacks at Air University's library in Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. While it is a western publication, I'm using references across the years to get more accurate data. Of course, newer systems are less likely to have accurate data, and data gets more accurate as Soviet client states broke off and allowed western intelligence to analyze the systems or they were seen in combat and western intelligence extrapolated based on their performance.

**Assumption**: You mentioned a small airplane, but did not specify which, so I will fill in. One of the most ubiquitous US civilian airplanes is the Cessna 172 Skyhawk. Anecdotal, but it is also the first plane I ever flew, and probably the first for the majority of American pilots. It's an almost 70 year old plane now, so it would be available for your hypothetical flight.

**Data and Methodology**: First, a quick term to explain - radar cross section (RCS). This is a measurement of a plane's reflectivity on radar. It's based off the material, shape, size, and smoothness of a plane's surface. The Cessna 172 has a RCS of 10m^2 [worst case.](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a029262.pdf) Worst case means with the nose of the aircraft pointed towards the radar. To compare this with other planes of its day, an F-14 Tomcat would have a 25m^2 RCS, an F-15C's is 20m^2, an F-16's is an impressive 5m^2. Today's F-22's unclassified/estimated RCS is .0001m^2, roughly the size of a marble. Long story short, your Cessna would be measurable on radar if it was tuned to look for something like you.

**Answer, kinda**: Without getting TOO much into how radars work, typical Soviet SA systems are not on 24/7 unless put on alert, they rely on men located at the radar site, and there are several layers of both range and sensitivity across several different types of SAMs. Strategic SAM systems aren't sensitive, they're meant to pick up US nuclear bombers and send a heavy missile that doesn't need to maneuver to hit its target, so they have very high ranges. Tactical SAM systems can be sensitive, but their range suffers because their missiles are intended for fighters that can 'defend' via their agility and turns, so the missiles need to keep up. Go figure, I can't source any documentation of Soviet missile defense deployments in 1986, so I can't tell you if there's an ingress route or not with certainty. HOWEVER - I can make an educated guess based on sheer geography and military knowledge. The Soviet Union's [entire eastern half](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/USSR_population_density_map_1982.jpg) is incredibly low density population-wise, and it's huge. Because they can't exactly make a wall of [ZSU-23-4s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZSU-23-4_Shilka) across their eastern border, there are likely several gaps you could ingress into and avoid detection by flying [nap of the earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nap-of-the-earth) (i.e., low). For more on Soviet air defenses, [this 1989 article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2538855?read-now=1&seq=12) on anticipated Soviet reactions to US stealth technology goes into their organization. 


The thing you'd have to worry most about is interceptors. [MiG-25s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-25) or [MiG-31s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-31) could be flying a [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_air_patrol) anywhere, and although [big sky theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_sky_theory) is a thing, depending on so many factors (their position, your position, your color, sun reflectivity, etc.), you could be easy to spot with their [Mk. I Eyeball sensors](https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_I_Eyeball) (incredibly advanced, I know). Additionally, most interceptors have radars that can be a bit more sensitive to other aircraft since they don't have to worry about the ground. Can't find a good illustration for an aircraft of that era, but [this one](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ae38d8bf17c62ecf0fdc1e93f3c4bc42-lq) serves well enough for the premise. 

ALL OF THAT BEING SAID, you can pretty much disregard it all, because as many aviation fans know, [Mathias Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathias_Rust) was a young, 50 hour Cessna 172 pilot (for reference, 50 hours is about what I'd expect the most basic of private pilots to have before being allowed to fly without an instructor in the US) who took his plane from West Germany to Iceland to Finland and then landed directly in Moscow's Red Square. Unlike your hypothetical flight, young Mathias did not make a return trip until he was pardoned about a year later, but I think it's worth mentioning because he WAS picked up on Soviet air defense radar, he WAS intercepted by Soviet aircraft, and through various failures and breakdowns in Soviet [C2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control), he made it through what was the most heavily defended and fortified air space in the world outside of the US.

To summarize, you probably could, but it would take a lot of precise flying, a pre-planned flight where you avoided populated areas and landed away from anywhere, and then returned without refueling (unless you have a perfect Russian accent and enough rubles to somehow arrange for AV gas to be transported to you), which would incredibly limit your options. Also, you're probably landing without a runway to avoid civilization, so I hope you're really good and can also find some dense ground that fits all of those conditions and is large enough for you to take off in.

"Kinda. Even though the first color photograph was produced by Thomas Sutton in 1861, it wasn't until the late 1890's that color photography was somewhat viable enough to be used by the public and not just an experimental technology.

The first non-colorized color photograph of Lady Liberty is [this one](https://i.imgur.com/69kaA7F.jpg), captured circa 1900 and depicting the statue during its color transition to the blue-green we see today. Although the oxidative process was already underway - it took only two decades for it to completely change the statue's color and by 1906 it was completely covered in verdigris - we can clearly see a hint of its original copper color in the photo. 

Although no color photo of the Statue of Liberty without its patina exists, there's plenty of artistic renditions of how it would have looked at the time such as [this.](https://i.imgur.com/oI1z8xQ.jpg)

"My biggest recommendation is to look for references that **cite their sources.** Plenty of accessible writing references more academic texts and even if you have difficulty parsing them, the fact that they're actually basing their information off of real scholasticism is a good (although not sure-fire) sign.

Second, I recommend trying to read widely. Confirm what you've read. If somebody makes a claim that doesn't ""feel"" right, track it down. Find out what other people say. This is good practice anyway, because even people who aren't trying to peddle bigotry and nonsense are often wrong because of perfectly normal biases that aren't, like, awful. Just the other day I found *several* references online to something (I honestly don't even remember what I was looking up) being invented in 4,000 BCE when it was actually invented in 400 BCE because somebody along the way made a typo and all of the other SEO-bait websites were just copying the error. It didn't feel right, so I dug and dug and dug until I figured out what had happened.

Third, pay attention to who created the source. Google them. Are they a professor at a respected institution? Are they at the center of any Twitter controversies? What does their ""About"" page say? What does their purpose for writing seem to be? Do they come across as someone who loves a particular time period, or do they seem to be really interested in making a point (which doesn't automatically mean they're wrong, but it is a factor to consider). For example, if a particular article is deadset on talking about Vikings in a particular way... is that person writing a whole bunch of articles making the same point, and really hyper focused on that point, or are the rest of their articles looking at other facets of Viking life that don't make that point?

Who agrees with them? Are the people agreeing with them engaging in something that feels academically rigorous, or are they just happy to have ""someone who sounds smart"" agreeing with *their* pre-existing biases?  


EDIT: Typo."
"

Back to 1876 and moving forward again, Jim Crow didn't come down in one fell swoop though, and again, even as 'Redeemers' claimed statehouses for white supremacy, it took some time to fully implement the exclusion of black voters (and, again, some poor whites too), and as late as 1896, as you note, turnout was still fairly high before taking a real plunge in 1900 and beyond, which well coincides with the point when Jim Crow was fully implace in the South, and soon after, the approval of such measures by the Supreme Court in Giles v. Harris.

To close out though, it ought to also be said that while Jim Crow was the hallmark of the American South, similar political tactics were not unknown throughout the country, just in different ways. In the Northern and Western states, turnout had dropped to 55 percent by the 1920 election, after all, and while it cannot be blamed on *institutional* barriers such as those in the South, responses to political mobilization by immigrants and lower-class groups *outside* the South by political elites saw attempts at ""demobilizing what they judged to be the least desirable components of the electorate"". They may not have been legally barring them from the polls in the same way that, say, South Carolina did, but through the late 1800s and early 20th century, they certainly were attempting to dissuade them from showing up.

In short, voter turnout in the United States was consistently fairly high up until the 1880s. The apex of turnout in 1876 isn't exactly an anomaly if we look at the turnouts in votes around it, such as 1868 at 78.1%, or 1880 at 79.4%, but it does coincide with a period in American history rife with political upheaval, not just the American South, still on the tail end of Reconstruction, but nationwide, with Populist movements in the ascendant. The end of the century, and the early 1900s, thus provide a stark contrast, as attempts both at institutional vote suppression, as well as simple 'demobilization' of cohorts of voters, lead to a decline in turnout nationwide.

"Why does Ramon not stop, does he say?  You got your money, you are literally rich beyond your wildest dreams by your own admission- why not bail to some tropical paradise?  Why go off and fight another battle if your entire company is wealthy beyond imagination?"
"I would say that for Mesopotamia I dont see that too much but it certainly could have been among the tools used to keep track of time. It is very much possible that there were various environmental factors used in folklore that just never got written down. These types of timekeeping would be too difficult to use for serious administrative purposes and so would be unlikely to appear in written records, but at the same time this does not mean at all that people didnt use those types of indicators. I would expect that many different indicators were used together, and even though celestial timekeeping is likely the most accurate way to keep track of days and plan future actions there were some inherent issues with it that would necessitate a different method be used.

Obviously the visibility at night is very important, and so if there were a stretch of mostly cloudy nights you may need to judge based on other factors what to do out of fear that by the time you actually can see the stars at night you will be too late. We have a few written examples of the problems caused by low visibility at night. Months in the Babylonian calendar could be either 29 or 30 days long, and the position of the moon on the nights in which the moon is first visible after cloudy nights can help approximate whether the previous month was 29 or 30 days if there was no visibility on those two days. 

In one really extreme example, a letter from a Neo-Assyrian scholar to the king Esarhaddon indicates that because of heavy cloud coverage he could not observe the moon's position until a few days into what would have been the new year at that point. When he finally did get to observe the moon and stars, he realized that the position was off enough to necessitate an intercalary month in the prior year. This caused an issue as the major new years ritual had already begun, and so the scholars were torn on how to fix the situation. They ultimately decided to put the ritual on hold and wait to finish it until it was appropriate in the next month, though it seems they did not feel they could restart the ritual entirely.

In addition to cloud coverage being an issue, it was not always possible for people to have a good location for viewing the stars even if there was no coverage. Seeing the first visibility of a star can be difficult if you cannot see the entire celestial horizon, as the star only appears briefly on the night of its first visibility. This is likely why celestial timekeeping would have always been one among multiple methods for keeping track of time. Later Babylonian astronomers used a number of stars that they refer to as ""ziqpu,"" or ""zenith,"" to help fix this issue. There are lists that basically say ""when X star is at its 'ziqpu,' Y star has its first visibility."" The ziqpu stars were all stars that were higher in the sky and so far easier to observe, but this system required far more astronomical knowledge and learning these stars and their connections would have likely required the ability to read and also access to the tablets that provide the lists.

One very obvious example that I havent mentioned, as it is not from Mesopotamia, of a natural timekeeping device is the flooding of the Nile in Egypt. This would have served as a very good timekeeping device and the regular cycle of the flood would have likely been used far more than other methods of timekeeping until again administration and urbanization necessitated a more standardized and robust system."

"Understanding when, and equally useful, why, conquest came to be unacceptable internationally hinges on a few things. What do we mean by ‘conquest’, crucially, what constitutes a “nation”? To separate these from other territorial arrangements from war (like military occupation), here’s the Permanent Court of International Justice definition, at a time where the League of Nations was heavily preoccupied with the issue: conquest is a “‘a cause of loss of sovereignty when there is war between two States and by reason of the defeat of one of them sovereignty over territory passes from the loser to the victorious State”.

A bit of a mouthful (and we need to unpack what sovereignty means), but I think it suffices here. But even when norms against conquest spread, the provenance of conquest, as linked to international law, might imply there are some forms of aggression that did not receive the same scrutiny, especially when who received recognition of a nation, with all the benefits of this status, was historically conditioned. This brings us questions on what the unacceptability of conquest demands, beyond responding to an ongoing act of conquest: the reversal of conquest itself?

In other words, you’ve asked a complicated question (as the 100+ deleted comments here suggest). I suspect the easiest answer to give you would be to trace the discussion of ‘conquest’ throughout international law, which usually leads to an account of some older, if not ancient custom of war that established a right to conquest – in Roman times, the medieval period, and into the 16th century with Hugo Grotius, Kant and other usual suspects. Various developments like the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht in Europe seem to constrain, but not rule out conquest, in making conquest’s legitimacy contingent on a peace treaty – although there’s some legal debate over whether that meant the peace treaty (not the conquest itself) was the basis for the transfer of territory. I don’t feel comfortable giving a precise rundown of this period, other than to say this account largely privileges a Western, and increasingly rationalist, account of international law. This usually risks overstating the extent to which law operated independently of politics - the evolution of international law as we know it today is fairly recent.

Nonetheless, by the 19th century, the validity of conquest began to be contested more and more: the Monroe doctrine was intended to avoid territorial changes in the region arising out of coercion and war, leading to the declaration at the First Inter-American Conference (1890) that “the principle of conquest shall not…be recognized as admissible under American public law”. Emphasis mine – this nonrecognition of conquest was construed as a domestic development, although other similar treaties like the Saavedra Lamas Treaty (1933) signed in Argentina echo this.

From here, determining when conquest stopped being internationally acceptable is a trickier question, especially defining ‘international recognition’ or ‘validity’ requires dealing with who the international community was. The League of Nations certainly played a major role, especially in Article 10 (“The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League”). But for the League, in 1924 the question of how to respond to such aggression was left open to the Council, owing to the political impossibility of specifying action within its foundational document.

To continue sketching this rough timeline, the two-article Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) further “condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another” in its brevity, which in effect would have condemned Japan’s conquest of Manchuria, or Italy and Ethiopia, which occurred anyway. Nonacceptability did not mean effectively translate to prohibition. To state the obvious: there is no authority analogous to what states have over us, that exists in the international sphere (‘anarchy’, the International Relations literature suggests).

Yet the nonexistence of a sovereign capable of using coercive force against states not complying with international agreements or behaving aggressively does not mean no form of higher political authority exists. International attitudes against conquest were – and are – always evolving, and I’d point to the United Nations, prohibiting force or the threat of force (in Article 2) as one culmination. The UN does not write international law, of course, but is comprised of its member-states and an institutional, administrative body (the UN Secretariat), organized into various agencies and councils. But through its resolutions, the UN has both affirmed certain norms against conquest and aggression, while developing various processes and institutions intended to contain attempts at conquest.

Most visible amongst these is peacekeeping, which developed initially as an extremely limited force intended to observe, not  involve themselves, in conflicts – as the name United Nations Emergency Force implies, when it was deployed in the Suez Crisis. Peacekeeping is especially notable as a response to conquest given that the UN never realized its plans for a standing army, something specified in its Charter as well: it implies again the political, diplomatic difficulties post-WWII in cooperation that posed limitations to attempts at international cooperation, and focusing solely on formal UN instruments and documents cannot tell us much about the complex nature of international politics going on elsewhere.

But even the General Assembly, for all its pretenses to be universal, was never as general as suggested – in the UN’s first decades, various colonies did not receive recognition. Were these nations? For all that nationhood implied a right to self-determination, to be exercised when they were not self-governing due to colonization or conquest, the situation of nations like Tibet never received formal attention at the UN, which was largely preoccupied with the Korean War. The People’s Republic of China took its seat at the Security Council in 1971, effectively ruling out this possibility. There have been numerous resolutions that have since outlawed, or affirmed the outlaw of conquest – often in specific cases like in the former Yugoslavia, Nagorno-Karabakh, or Georgia.

However, historical and political terms like the (legitimate) “nation” cannot escape more normative judgments. Beyond questions of what counts as a nation, whose free status and rights to self-determination would have to be preserved, what should be done when this peace was violated? Peacekeeping, as the name implies, arises largely when there was a peace to keep, and even longstanding operations like in Cyprus ostensibly prevented conquest of the island by one party or another, without necessarily delivering a political solution. The same might go for Israel, the context I suspect you had in mind asking this question, where UN resolutions in 1968 essentially denied the validity of conquest or boundary changes, a position incongruent with territorial changes and Israeli occupation since. (I’ll set aside discussion of more recent resolutions given the sub). Most dramatically, attempts by Iraq to conquer and annex Kuwait were met with the Security Council’s authorization of an intervention. But even this further complicated matters when UN authorization was involved a decade later to justify war in Iraq (again, 20 year rule!)

Here, the political science and IR literature has something to say too: Douglas Lemke has an interesting article arguing that norms against conquest seem to hold only when all parties are recognized as de jure sovereign states, but less so for nonsovereign polities (think Somaliland – whose peaceful behaviour seems to qualify them for membership under UN). Yet his categories and descriptions of conquest remind us that what categories we use to analyse and historically evaluate conflicts and politics matter: unlike Lemke, I don’t think the Rwandan Patriotic Front defeating the Hutu government in Kigali to take power was a “conquest by territorial contenders), nor was there a “conquest of the Tamil de facto state” in Sri Lanka – situations better viewed as a civil war. Nonetheless, if the UN, alongside a non-comprehensive system of international law is the closest there exists today to some form of international political authority, my answer to your question would be that it certainly became unacceptable to engage in conquest by 1945.

I’ve offered only a sketch on how we might think about conquest and the hardening international norms against conquest here. What I’d like to reiterate, however, is that this question shouldn’t be considered as a purely legal one, or independent of what responses came after – just like how a criminal code not specifying the punishment would be vague at best, insidious at worst."
"Currently on mobile so I do not have sources, if someone else doesn't share some I'll try to come back later.

But another layer to the just war thing is treaties. Fighting back against someone who broke a treaty is just, but being the one to break it in the first place is not. The US repeatedly made treaties with Native American tribes, and then broke them, usually by taking land. That the US was the one to break the treaty - instead of responding to an already broken one - is one of the contributors to the perception of the US *stealing* the land instead of conquering it."
"After an incredibly annoying and somewhat exhausting research that /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov and I conducted over the last couple of hours, I think it's possible to cut through the confusion: The painting shows not just Maria Theresia's dead children but contains a nod to her grand-child Christina, born in 1762 by Isabella of Parma, wife of Maria Theresia's son Jospeh II.

Maria Theresia had 16 children, five of which died before becoming full adults but only three of which died very early: Maria Elisabeth (1737–1740), her first child, died suddenly at age three of unspecified reasons.

Maria Karolina (1740–1741), her third child, died of severe cramps at age 1.

Maria Karolina (1748–1748), her tenth child, barely lived two hours after it had been born.

While several of her children had nichnames by which they were called – Marie Christine (1742–1798) was called Mimi; Maria Karolina (1752-1814) was called Charlotte – the most likely explanation going by the names Martin von Meytens who painted the picture in 1765 as part of the Habsurg family portraits in the Innsbruck Hofburg is that from bottom to top, it's Elisabeth, Karolina I, then Karolina II and finally Christina, grand daughter of Maria Theresia.

There is no reference to any other stillborn or miscarried children with Maria Theresia and the only child called Christina or Christine survived until adulthood so according to our research with book like Franz Herre: MNaria Theresia, 2004 and Hanne Egghardt: Maria Theresias Kinder is that one."

"I wrote my master's thesis in history on Frances Cleveland and public perceptions of her role as first lady. One of the chapters focused on the wedding of Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsom, and in researching this portion I read as much newspaper and magazine coverage as I could get access to. This included major papers such as the *New York Times*, the *New York Tribune*, the *Chicago Daily News,* and the Washington D.C. *Evening Star*. I also examined popular mass-circulation magazines, including *Ladies Home Journal, Harpers Bazar, Puck,* and *Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspapers*. 

All of these publications devoted extensive space to the White House wedding, and in none of them did I encounter any hint that there was anything strange about the pairing of Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsom. In fact, the general sentiment was summed up by an article in the *New York Tribune* (titled ""Mr. Cleveland's Devotion to His Ward"") that described it as ""like a story book or fairy tale."" Up until the announcement of the engagement, Cleveland had had a reputation for being rather gruff and unsociable, and people seem to have been genuinely charmed by the revelation of his romantic side. As one writer for the *Chicago Daily News* observed:

""There is something characteristically American about the merry yet respectful, jesting yet sincere, interest our people take in the nuptials of the president. Every bit of gossip concerning his courtship and the life, appearance, and character of his intended is discussed with as much avidity as if she were to be the bride of some personal friend. The people do not stand afar off and watch the preparations for the marriage as if it were to be a pageant of royalty. They are not restrained by any awe of the president's high office from showing their curiosity about his persona affairs. They feel that he owes his elevation to their suffrage, and they wish him joy and tender him advice with all the freedom of equals.""

Of course, this was just what was being said publicly, but I have no reason to think private opinion was drastically different. Frances was an enormously popular figure throughout Cleveland's first term in office, and she was joyfully welcomed back to the White House in 1892. By that time the Clevelands had a daughter, Ruth, and would welcome a second child in 1893, completing the picture of domestic felicity."

I don't understand this, isn't impeachment evidence of working checks and balances?

Am I just out of touch with public perception or did I misunderstand something?"

* [The Innovators of Armouring](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6zlr8f/are_any_particular_people_or_workshops_noted_as/)

But since u/MrAlbs mentioned arms manufacturing, let's look at the medieval armour industry form a different angle - in what ways was it dominated by entities like modern corporations. The quick, simple answer is 'not much' - the kind of relationships that armourers had with each other and with the merchants that sold armour are quite different from a modern joint-stock company. The individual workshops are more individual, and their relationships are less directly controlled than in a modern corporate ownership structure. A medieval armourer, if he is an employee, is an employee in a workshop of a few dozen at most. Indeed, some places, like Nuremberg, deliberately establish municipal regulations (restricting the number of apprentices and journeymen) that prevent individual armourers' workshops from getting too large and individual armourers from amassing too much power and influence.

But taken from a different perspective, a variety of relationships can be described in more corporate terms. First, as sunagainstgold already mentioned, guilds (where they exist) allow armourers to get together to amass capital for joint projects (like polishing mills in early 16th century Cologne) and to regulate quality and workshop organization (quality in the form of inspections and municipal marking, workshop organization in terms of restrictions on the size of workshops). City marks in particular, by marking armour from a certain place that has been inspected to the same standard with a mark of quality, establish a strong armour 'brand' for cities like Augsburg and Nuremberg*. This is particularly important for a place like Augsburg, whose armourers target a 'premium' market for high-quality heat-treated armour. It is here perhaps relevant to say that in England the guilds are called 'companies.' Though they don't have profits or employees (instead, they have members) when taken together all the armourers of say, the Cologne armourers guild, produced hundreds or thousands of armours in a year and between them all produced massive revenues.

Another structure that is rather 'corporate' is the merchant-armourers of 15th century Milan, particularly the Missaglia family. This is a particular structure found in Italy, which didn't have guilds in the same sense as the cities North of the alps. These arrangements use a system of subcontracting to effectively employ other armourers (often with workshops of their own) as a kind of subsidiary craftsmen. These contracts would specify a term and a division of the profits. These subsidiary armourers would specialize in particular pieces of armour - gauntlets, helmets, breastplates, arm harnesses, and deliver the pieces to a workshop for assembly by a specialized assembler of armour, a *traversator*, who would also take care of heat treatment. We can see this division of labor reflected on the armours themselves in the form of the armourers marks of each craftsman (or at least, each lead craftsman) that worked on the armour. The famous 'Avant' armour from Churburg Castle has 9 distinct armourers marks on it, for 51 marks total! However, all pieces seem to have undergone the same heat treatment. In some other cases, contracts from a merchant-armourer would lay out money for raw materials and charge a subcontractor with making the actual harness, with a contractually dictated division of profits when the armour was sold. Essentially, the merchant provided capital and the artisan-armourer provided labor. In the case of the Missaglia the power of the family extended beyond the contracts. They had workshops in France, Spain and Southern Italy, as well as Milan. They owned iron mines, blast furnaces and polishing mills, creating vertical integration that controlled the entire supply chain and sequence of production. Their entire operation was worth hundreds of thousands of scudi. The Sforza Dukes of Milan were on their debt, which the Missaglia used to their advantage, receiving gifts (that polishing mill) and other favors. They used their wealth to buy an estate and then eventually a noble title. 

In the 16th century their operation was gradually taken over by the Negroli family. Though their most famous members are the artist-armourers Fillipo, Franscesco and Giovan Paolo, other parts of the family focused on selling armour rather than making it, and in the process became 16th century millionaires.

"So, this is a very complex question, to the point where entire books could be, and likely have been, written on the question of the development of Liberalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. You are also asking two different questions here, why is there a difference between continental usages of the term, and why Liberalism became synonymous with the center-left.

I will tackle the latter, rather than the former, as the specific reasons for etymological terms being utilized differently in different areas isn't my area of expertise. Also, for anyone looking to put all this in its proper context, and he does a masterful job of this, I'd suggest Eric Hobsbawm's Age of series, where he charts historical developments, including the development of the ideology of Liberalism, throughout the so-called ""Long Nineteenth Century"" between 1789 and 1914.

I will be simplifying here greatly for the sake of brevity and specificity. Liberalism is a political ideology that emphasizes the liberty of the individual, although what that means in practice is constantly changing and evolving.

A prime figure in Liberalism is John Locke, who wrote that individuals had natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and that it was unjust of governments to arbitrarily seize or restrict these natural rights. In modern times these are often called Classical Liberals.

However, there is also another political philosophy growing out of Liberalism. This philosophy is often called Social Liberalism. Many Liberals began believing that the promises of liberty and equality of Liberalism couldn't be achieved without the amelioration of material conditions and market intervention, something that Classical Liberals abhor. Classical Liberals believe that all people working in concert towards their own happiness, specifically through a free market. There are many shades of grey between these two poles, but that is the basic difference between the two different camps.

Classical Liberals believe a free and unregulated market, alongside the rule of law and democracy, are the best tools for maximizing human happiness. Social Liberals, on the other hand, believe that social conditions need to be ameliorated through government action and that a totally unregulated market can be harmful to the human condition. Many Classical Liberals made alliances of convenience or ideology with Conservatives as time went on, while Social Liberals carved out a middle position between the Conservatives and the rising Socialists, and in the modern age it can be hard to distinguish the two.

A good figure to illustrate this trend is John Stuart Mill. Another influential Liberal thinker, Mill already shows the beginnings of the move towards a more Social form of Liberalism in his earlier years.

He passionately defends the rights of the individual to be free from the tyranny of the state and that intervention by the government should only take place when an individual is harming others. He considers progressive taxes to be a form of mild robbery upon those who work harder. However, Mill believed that in theory, if it could be justified on utilitarian grounds, that is increasing the overall amount of happiness the most, government intervention could be justified.

However, later on, Mill trends more and more towards intervention in the economy and economic justice. He championed worker's co-operatives and believed that the capitalist system hindered the continued development and happiness of humanity. The object here has not changed. He championed the freedom and equality of humanity in both cases. To simplify his work, and Liberalism's changes in general greatly, the ends did not really change, only the means and the scope.

If anyone has any questions or requests for clarification feel free to ask, as this is a very brief overview of a very complex topic."
"I can speak for the history of WWII, but boy did it ever.

&#x200B;

The historiography of WWII has had some serious issues over the years.  The official history of the war written by the Americans was informed by none other than former OKH chief, Franz Halder.  The 1950 combat infantry manual for the US Army that talked about Soviet fighting capabilities was HEAVILY informed by the Germans... and so was popular history.  Halder has his diary, and Heinz Guderian and Erich von Manstein wrote memoirs that were widely published in the West by the 1950's.

&#x200B;

The large histories of the 1960's and 1970's suffered from having access to German memoirs and remembrances, but not always their sources if they were captured by the Soviets or destroyed.  Soviet sources were hidden and Soviet writings and memoirs had some serious issues:

&#x200B;

1. Censorship.  Soviet Marshall Georgi Zhukov once had the word ""rout"" censored to ""withdrawal.""  A picture from Stalingrad showing Chuikov's 62nd Army staff gathering and laughing as a man held a machine gun... well that was actually a puppy.  Things like that happened all the time and it meant that information was either untrustworthy, OR
2. The West didn't trust Soviet sources.  A CIA paper written in the late 1950's titled ""Caeser X 59"" basically disregards most earlier writings and only then starts to trust sources from the Soviets.  The CIA had a unique take because
3. Translation.  Not every important Russian/Soviet source made it to the West.

&#x200B;

As such, there are issues that plague histories that rely on the Germans and sparsely on the Soviets.  Here are just a few examples.

&#x200B;

Second Kharkov and the Donbas Campaign.  Reading Alan Clark's Barbarossa (first published in 1965), it seems like the Soviets learned in the Spring/Summer 1942 how to retreat and withdraw before being encircled.  There is now serious doubt that this was the case.  Internal documents (Glantz and the first book in the Stalingrad trilogy has a lot on this) shows that these withdrawals were often piecemeal and against orders from Stavka (Soviet High Command).  Veteran testimony that has come out recently sure talks about morale issues and retreats and a shattered army.  This is all new.

&#x200B;

We now have documents showing that Chuikov tried to move the HQ of the 62nd Army to the East bank of the Volga... twice.  This is laid out in a book that is really high on Chuikov (Michael K. Jones - Stalingrad: How the Red Army Triumphed).

&#x200B;

Speaking of Stalingrad.  What a good example of how Stalin and the Red Army learned how to attack at one place at one time.  Right?  I mean, we have internal cables from Zhukov telling officers how to fight in the Winter of 1941-1942 (he literally had to tell officers that they should use recon, then air, then artillery, then have more dudes than the enemy, check Glantz - When Titans Clashed, stuff like that which could be embarrassing to the Red Army is far more widely available now).  Anyway, Operation Uranus wasn't the only attack.  The Soviets had multiple operations around Rzhev that led to hundreds of thousands of casualties... each.  These were, by and large, lost to history until Russian historians got access to the archives and the West got access to them.

&#x200B;

The Purges are being reconsidered.  I would read Richard Overy ""Russia's War,"" but new numbers post archives show that the Red Army officer corps was larger than we thought and that more men were let out of prison and back into the army than we thought (think Rokossovsky).

&#x200B;

Some historians think that Lend-Lease was FAR more important than previously thought.  Jonathon House, using post-archive numbers puts the number of American trucks up to 500,000.  He argues that Kursk would not be possible without US help, adding years to the length of the war.  Albert Weeks ""Russia's Lifesaver"" brings some of those Russian numbers to an English translation if you want to check them out.  I find the book not super useful, but the figures are nice.

&#x200B;

You get chilling internal memos like the NKVD records from the Winter War against Finland.  When they were considering how to re-write infantry manuals after losing tens of thousands of men, one commissar noted that they needed to start training men how to go to ground under fire (Catherine Merridale - Ivan's War), yeah... crazy stuff.

&#x200B;

David Glantz is probably the go-to on this for a Western reader.  His Stalingrad series uses Soviet and German records to painstakingly detail the day by day order of battle and location of the units as the battle unfolds.  Reading that can show that they often disagreed on what units were where (like Stalingrad, Chuikov gave the Germans two divisions that weren't actually present).

&#x200B;

I'm sure I'm leaving stuff out, it would be impossible not to, but this gives you an idea of some of the things going on in the historiography.

&#x200B;

I recommend listening to dudes smarter than myself on the matter: (all of these lectures are available on Youtube)

">Tl;dr: if your professor has presented this view as divine truth, then there are many reasons to question it. **But if, as seems more likely, they are challenging you to rethink the way you’ve framed the Second World War up until now, then they're just doing their job.**

"I'm writing this from memory as I'm at work right now and all my books are at home, so I apologize for the briefness (mods, if it is too short please feel free to delete.) While, to my recollection, she never commented PUBLICLY about her father executing her mother, she was close to her Boleyn relatives and showed the favour at her court once she was queen. She was also known to wear a small pendant with her mother's portrait inside.

Her aunt Mary Carey (nee Boleyn, Anne's sister) had two children from her marriage to William Carey--Henry and Catherine (many speculate one or both were actually Henry VIII children, but that's a whole different topic.) Henry was knighted and then made 1st Baron Hunsdon shortly after Elizabeth's accession, became a Knight of the Garter later on, and was offered the title Earl of Ormond (which was a Boleyn family title) on his deathbed (he declined.) Catherine married Sir Francis Knollys and had 10+ kids, and all except the last one lived to adulthood. Catherine became chief Lady of the Bedchamber to Elizabeth, an incredibly close and intimate position. Both Henry and Catherine served Elizabeth until their deaths, and both were buried in honour in Westminster Abbey and Elizabeth paid for their funerals.

The only member of the extended Boleyn family she fell out with was the eldest daughter of Catherine Knollys, Lettice. Lettice was described to look very similar to Elizabeth when she (Liz) was younger--red hair, vivacious personality, charming, etc. But she incurred Elizabeth's wrath when she married the current favourite Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. Elizabeth banished them both from court. In time Leicester was allowed to return and was eventually back in Elizabeth's good grace, but not Lettice. Until Elizabeth's death in 1603 they met only once and put on a good show for the court, but no one bought it and nothing changed.

After Leicester's death Lettice's son from her first marriage became the Queen's favouite--Robert Deveraux, 2nd Earl of Essex, called ""Sweet Robin"" by Elizabeth. However, he thought being the Queen's favourite meant he could do what he pleased. Long story short, his anger led him to believe he could force a meeting with Elizabeth when he was on the outs with her, he was proclaimed a traitor, and was executed.

If you want to read further I recommend these books by Alison Weir: The Life of Elizabeth I; The Lady in the Tower: The Fall of Anne Boleyn; Mary Boleyn: The Mistress of Kings. By Nicola Tallis: Elizabeth's Rival: The Tumultuous Tale of Lettice Knollys, Countess of Leicester.

TL;DR: while Elizabeth appeared to ""put the past behind her"" once she became queen, she routinely favoured and rewarded members of her Boleyn family...unless they crossed her."
">The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History by Raymond Kévorkian is then the deeper complement if you do want that heavier, academic treatment, providing a very thorough study of the topic.

"It is not an assumption of two kinds. It is based on hundreds of knives taken as archaeological evidence that there are two kinds.

They wouldn’t recognize it as a “kitchen knife” (as opposed to a multi-purpose knife that can be used for food amongst other things) because they didn’t have such a niche."
"Witchcraft as envisaged in the *Malleus* - an organized form of worship in league with Satan and opposed to Christianity and involving the manipulation of supernatural forces, with the main adherents of said organization being mainly women - is not currently accepted to have actually existed. While there were groups of people who were organized in local faith movements that the Catholic Church deemed heretical, such as the Albigensians and the Vaudois, and some subsequent 20th century writers like Margaret Murray in *The Witch-Cult in Western Europe* speculated at the survival of a pre-Christian pagan cult-network, there is essentially no solid evidence that ""witchcraft"" was actually an organized activity along the lines envisaged by the *Malleus*. I talk about Murray in a bit greater depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6bobyr/was_margaret_murrays_witchcult_hypothesis_ever/), which might clear things up.

So yes, the main demand for the work appears to have been among secular authorities who needed a source text for prosecutions related to witchcraft and heresy."
"Yes. People would let their pigs free during the days to find their food elsewhere and, presumably, not tear up their shed/barn/yard by rooting. And yes, sometimes the pigs would snout their way into unlocked homes, and sometimes a pig would either eat, or try to, an unwatched infant. This wasn't exactly an everyday event, but it happened enough to leave traces in court records and to be considered one motivation for laws like 15C Nuremberg's against letting your pigs roam free."

"Everyone knew that their houses and shops were built on ruins, if only because ancient masonry and tiles turned up whenever a foundation or well was dug. It was also common knowledge that Rome had once been much larger. The identity of specific buildings, however, seems to have faded after the ninth century. By the time the medieval Mirabilia Urbis Romae (Marvels of Rome) was produced, the Colosseum was assumed to have been a colossal temple of the Sun, the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius was confidently attributed to Constantine, and almost every monument not clearly labeled by an inscription was misidentified."
"Space travel was a theme of proto-science fiction like *Les Posthumes* (1802) by Nicolas-Edme Rétif, *Star ou Psi de Cassiopée: Histoire Merveilleuse de l’un des Mondes de l’Espace* (1854) by C. I. Defontenay, and *Lumen* (1872) by Camille Flammarion, but these stories lacked any strong scientific understanding of what space was like or what space travel entailed. Some of the first actual fiction to deal with the actual science of potential space travel was Jules Verne's *De la Terre à la Lune, trajet direct en 97 heures 20 minutes* (1865) and its sequel *Autour de la Lune* (1869), which had the Baltimore Gun Club use a massive space gun to overcome gravity; H. G. Wells got in on the act with *The War of the Worlds* (1897), which involves projectile-ships, and *The First Men in the Moon* (1900-1901), where a gravity-negating mineral facilitates the travel.

In these early examples, the Earth-travelers are explicitly civilian, and the format of the story is that of the adventure-romance, a mode of fiction that would become known as *scientific romance*. Fiction of this genre would not always even bother with physical vessels for interplanetary travel; Edgar Rice Burroughs' *A Princess of Mars* (1912) involves a kind of transposition of bodies through space, much like Mark Twain's *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court* (1889), and E. R. Eddison in *The Worm Ouroboros* (1922) used the same basic idea for his fantasy world (nominally Mercury).

Wells' *War of the Worlds* would involve an *invading* extraterrestrial force, but this not based explicitly on contemporary military structures, but a sort of inversion of invasion literature, where the technologically inferior Earth-forces are faced with a numerically inferior but technologically superior foe.

""Future war"" fiction was another proto-science fiction mode, with close parallels to Yellow Peril literature and the like, and here we get closer to what might be the actual answer to your question. An unauthorized sequel to *War of the Worlds*, *Edison's Conquest of Mars* (1898) has the Earthlings repay the favor by invading Mars, with ""Ships of Space"" powered by a reverse-engineered Martian anti-gravity device and armed with disintegrator rays, and the immediate parallel is navel vessels:

> From the northeast, their great guns flashing in the sunlight and their huge funnels belching black volumes that rested like thunder clouds upon the sea, came the mighty warships of England, with her meteor flag streaming red in the breeze, while the royal insignia, indicating the presence of the ruler of the British Empire, was conspicuously displayed upon the flagship of the squadron.

By the same token, *The Struggle for Empire: A Story of the Year 2236* (1900) by Robert William Cole is basically the contemporary British Empire with its ships and fleets and colonies projected into space...and I mean that quite literally, it replicates the entire command structure of a naval fleet:

> Early in the morning of the 12th of May, in the year 2237, the vast space of ground where the interstellar fleet lay drawn up was a scene of great bustle and excitement. The last preparations were being made, for in a few hours they were to dash off into space. The vessels were drawn up in long lines, being arranged in divisions, with the flag-ship of each division in the middle, and the other ships lying on either side of it according to their size and qualities. The flag-ship of the Admiral-in-Chief was floating about a hundred yards in the air, the Union Jack flying from one of its masts [...]

Not every story involving space-travel involved vessels, and not every vessel was military, but those that were military in this early period tended to be follow military lines of thinking - and there are real-life parallels to this, in the command structure of civilian merchant ships and (eventually) practical air travel.

The simile was sometimes carried over in other ways. ""Space Marines"" for example are first mentioned in ""Captain Brink of the Space Marines"" (1932) and ""The Space Marines and the Slavers"" (1936) by Bob Olsen; they rose to prominence with the space-transported mobile mechanized infantry in *Starship Soldier* (later *Starship Troopers*, 1959) by Robert Heinlein, which would in turn inspired the colonial marines of the film *Aliens* (1986).

In a lot of ways, it's fair to say that the idea of imagining space military forces based around terrestrial military organizations and forces is inherently flawed; writers and artists were drawing on what they knew - and as warfare changed and developed socially and technologically, this continued (and continues) to be true. The Star Destroyer from the opening of *Star Wars* (1977) is essentially an aircraft carrier in space, carrying multiple smaller attack craft (TIE Fighters) which attack or sortie in small squadrons, and which provide air cover for ground troops and mechanized infantry during assaults, as they did in *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980). The Vietnam War proved influential on David Drake's *Hammer's Slammers* (1979), reflecting his experience in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment.

Not all science fiction has explicitly followed this model; the military forces of *Dune* for example include both the presence of tactical nuclear weapons *and* effective deterrents; the initial stages of the military aspect of the conflict thus involve both references to traditional medieval siege and later 20th-century-style guerrilla warfare. The lack of specific military spacecraft (given the Spacing Guild monopoly) means that much of the rank-structure and organization is based on army ranks and command."

"Hi there! You’ve asked a question along the lines of ‘why didn’t I learn about X’. We’re happy to let this question stand, but there are a variety of reasons why you may find it hard to get a good answer to this question on /r/AskHistorians.

Firstly, school curricula and how they are taught vary strongly between different countries and even different states. Additionally, how they are taught is often influenced by teachers having to compromise on how much time they can spend on any given topic. More information on your location and level of education might be helpful to answer this question.

Secondly, we have noticed that these questions are often phrased to be about people's individual experiences but what they are really about is why a certain event is more prominent in popular narratives of history than others.

Instead of asking ""Why haven't I learned about event ..."", consider asking ""What importance do scholars assign to event ... in the context of such and such history?"" The latter question is often closer to what people actually want to know and is more likely to get a good answer from an expert.

"I've had the pleasure of talking about Roman concrete several times on AskHistorians. This is an edited and slightly expanded version of an older answer:

Building techniques never die. They just become irrelevant...

First, some background on Roman concrete. Concrete is best understood as a type of mortar. Mortar (the stuff that holds courses of bricks or blocks together) is typically composed of water, sand, and lime. There are variations - the Chinese, famously, made mortar by mixing lime with sticky rice - but in the Classical Mediterranean, the water, sand, and lime formula was always standard.

Roman concrete differed from Roman mortar by virtue of its ""secret ingredient"" - the volcanic ash known as pozzolana, which was used in place of regular sand. This was really just a case of good geological luck on the Romans' part: Rome happened to be located near large deposits of pozzolana (later, even larger deposits would be discovered on the Bay of Naples). Roman masons quickly discovered that mortar made with pozzolana was much stronger that mortar made with regular sand. And so concrete was born.

It should be noted here that not all Roman concrete was made with pozzolana. Most Italian concrete was, and pozzolana was occasionally shipped to (coastal) cities in other parts of the Empire (Herod the Great had a batch brought all the way to Caesarea in modern Israel). But there were deposits of volcanic ash with similar properties in the provinces (above all in the Greek islands). Roman builders eventually discovered, moreover, that a fairly good concrete could be made by using crushed terracotta in place of pozzolana.

Contrary to what you might think, the Romans were seldom adventurous builders. Roman architects received no formal training, and had no way of mathematically modeling forces or stresses or other things likely to cause the collapse of buildings and careers. As a result, they tended to be very conservative in their use of building materials. At first, they only used concrete to save time when building thick walls: instead of making the wall of building four or five brick courses thick, they simply built brick facings and filled the interior of the wall with a mixture of rubble and concrete.

Sometime in the first century BCE, the Romans discovered that concrete made with pozzolana could harden underwater - in fact, thanks to chemical reactions the Romans knew nothing about, saltwater actually strengthened the material, forming nearly unbreakable mineral bonds. So in the waning days of the Republic, Romans began to build ""artificial harbors"" like the famous example at Caesarea Maritima. But the great days of concrete architecture still lay ahead.

Only in the mid-first century CE, under the stimulus of imperial funding and imperial demands, did concrete begin to be used to create the spectacular vaults and domes that are the greatest achievement of Roman architecture. The revolutionary moment came in the reign of Nero, when the architects Severus and Celer (about whom we know nothing) created an impressive series of concrete rooms for Nero's infamously decadent Golden House. These represented the culmination of nearly a century of experimenting with vaults, primarily in the large, imperially-sponsored bath buildings. Once Severus and Celer showed what concrete could do, the creative floodgates, for the first time in Roman architectural history, were truly open.

The next century and a half witnessed the construction of the most famous Roman monuments: the Colosseum (supported by a colossal concrete foundation), the Pantheon (crowned by a spectacular concrete dome), the Baths of Caracalla (roofed by an awesome series of concrete vaults and domes), the Basilica of Maxentius in the Roman Forum (likewise vaulted) and so on.

Concrete was also used in the provinces, but always on a much smaller scale. The basic reason was simple: the Roman emperors, by an incredible margin the wealthiest men in the Empire, seldom sponsored building projects outside Rome. In large provincial cities like Alexandria or Antioch or Ephesus, very impressive building projects were undertaken. But these were financed by the benefactions of wealthy citizens (often working in concert); and provincial notables, for all their wealth, could never create anything on the scale of the concrete-crowned projects in Rome. As a result, provincial concrete tended to be used more conservatively. This was not solely a matter of scale - in the Greek east, for example, a well-established tradition of fine masonry ensured that stone, not concrete, was often used in domes - but without imperially-sponsored scale or imperially-sponsored funding, the use of concrete had a fairly limited scope.

Once the emperors stopped paying for large-scale construction projects, concrete largely reverted to what it had been before the Roman architectural revolution: a useful filler for thick walls. Roman concrete was not forgotten in the early middle ages, at least not in Byzantium: Procopius (*Buildings*, 1.11-18-20) mentions Justinian using Roman hydraulic concrete to build a new harbor in Constantinople. But after this, aside from a few mentions in Isidore of Seville's *Etymologies* (e.g. 15.8.1), concrete virtually vanishes from the literary record.

The domes of Justinian's Haghia Sophia, the last great product of Roman engineering, were made of brick bedded in concrete. But after Justinian, the troubles that overtook the Eastern Empire (like those that had destroyed the imperial order in the west a century earlier) virtually ended monumental building for centuries. And in those centuries, concrete vaults and domes became, like so much else across the former Roman world, mementos of a vanished past.

Am I wrong or cynical to wonder how this happened? I would have thought that in 1960, in Alabama, a black man might be convicted of anything regardless of how innocent, or even how absurd the charges against him.

Wasn't this also 5 or 6 years into the civil rights stuff? He'd have had some amount of fame/notoriety too in regards to those jurors, wouldn't he?

"How are you determining the loss? The colonies may have been in economic decline, but the colonizing country and its companies greatly benefited.


In Lebanon, for example, France used the region as a captured market for French goods and companies, and as a base from which to draw raw materials. French economic experts laid out fiscal, land ownership, and monetary changes. French companies were granted special privileges, such as Companie Auto-Routiere du Levant and D.H.P. Railway Company. These were both awarded 'kilometric guarantees', and the former was given tax exemptions. France also put up high tariff barriers for transactions between French Mandatory Lebanon and Syria in order to promote increased trade with France. In 1933 General Count Camien de Martel was appointed High Commissioner for French Lebanon. In 1934 he issued decree No. 275/LR in which the trade and manufacture of tobacco was granted as a monopoly to a French company for the span of 25 years. A similar decree had already existed targeting only Muslim areas of Lebanon, but in 1934 the Christian areas of Mount Lebanon were included as well for the first time (France had a different taxation system for the majority Christian areas from the Muslim areas). This angered Patriarch Arida of the Maronite Church enough that he publicly took a stance against de Martel, a first for the Maronite Church. It would lead to massive protests across Lebanon and exacerbated the land ownership problem in rural areas. In 1924, Law No. 2500 was passed that enforced the parcellation of collectively managed farmlands. This allowed large landowners to buy up more plots. So in tandem with the tobacco laws, the strength of large landowners on agricultural lands was increased, and the farming of tobacco also greatly increased. Until the 1960s, 70% of southern Lebanon's farmlands were used to grow tobacco. I highly recommend the book Inventing Lebanon, by Kais Firro, that covers all this extensively.

Regarding Egypt, its economy was in decline through the entire period of British control, despite Britain and British companies benefiting greatly. First, a little background:

There was economic competition all across Europe after the Napoleonic wars. Britain and France in the 1800s had both raised tariffs on each other's goods. This meant that Britain was exporting more goods in 1839 to Aleppo than it was to France. (Marsot, p233). Egypt in the mid-1800s had split off from the Ottoman empire and had formed an empire by taking the Levantine coast (what's today Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, etc) and what's today western Saudi Arabia. Egypt also controlled Sudan and took parts of Libya and also occupied Greece. It's out of the scope of this comment, but Britain, France, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Czarist Russia all allied together and sent their navies and armies to threaten Muhammad Ali pasha of Egypt. The Ottoman empire eventually signs the [Treaty of Balta Liman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Balta_Liman). Egypt goes from being one of the foremost industralizing countries in the world, to being essentially an agriculture-based economy. The economy of the Ottoman empire itself becomes crippled. The French ambassador to the Ottoman Empire calls it ""a complete economic revolution."" Egypt and Syria are subsumed in this treaty and become bread baskets for France and Britain, with the taxes on some items reduced tenfold, and as with Lebanon in the 1920s-40s during the French Mandate period, both Egypt and Syria become captured markets for French and British finished goods. British advisers and economic experts wield increasing power in Egypt.

In the following decades, the Khedive Ismail of Egypt borrows heavily from Britain. Egypt is at war in Eritrea, Sudan, and Ethiopia, and is also expending a ton of money on the building of the Suez Canal, and so he borrows extensively from British and French banks to keep the war going. He borrows at rates of 12-26% interest. He makes purchases from British contractors on projects such as harbours, railroad construction, waterworks, etc. where he was being charged 3-4x the price. He begins to borrow against state-owned lands while watching the industrialization halt and economy crumble. Egypt's army after 1841 goes from 100,000 to a legally mandated 18,000 troops.

In 1875 he sells Egypt's share in the Suez Canal to the British government. He is also advised by the British government to petition the Ottoman Sultan to make his own debt equivalent to Egypt's national debt. Britain sends a 5-man team to take over control of Egypt's economy. France also sends an economic commissioner. The British press at this time openly talks about how Egypt will fall into Britain's hands when the economy collapses. Charles Wilson becomes Egypt's Minister of Finance, and a Frenchman becomes Minister for Public Works. In order to pay back the debts an aggressive takeover of public goods takes place, and something like 80% of Egypt's government revenue goes to its creditors. Forced purchase of crops for half their price takes place, public servants' wages go unpaid, and there's a small famine in the late 1870s. A 2nd British commission of the economy takes over under Rivers-Wilson and Evelyn Baring. There's no reduction of interest rates or taxes. Instead, the Finance Ministry goes to Rivers Wilson, France gets the Ministry for Public Works, Italy gets the Ministry of Justice, and Austria gets the Ministory of Education. Egypt's economy continues to be plundered by the creditors, and extreme poverty spreads. [A revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBUrabi_revolt) breaks out, and 40,000 British troops are brought in to quell it. After Britain formally takes control after deposing the Khedive Ismail, they pass a series of policies that Ismail had previously proposed previously, such as creating a debt payment schedule and limiting interest rates to 4%. 


Throughout this period, the Egyptian economy was tanking, but Britain and British companies benefited immensely. In the paper 'Egypt's Growth Performance Under Economic Liberalism' by Tarik Yousef, he shows that between 1886–1945, almost the entire period of British rule over Egypt, a period when the National Bank of Egypt was owned by Britain, there was no growth whatsoever in income per capita.

Some books I like on this subject are: Egypt In the Reign of Muhammad Ali, by Afaf Lutfi Marsot, Egypt's Ruin: A Financial and Administrative Record, by Theodore Rothstein, Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, All the Pasha's Men by Khaled Fahmy, and the paper by Tarik Yousef that I cited above.

"A problem that you're going to have on this sub in particular is that you're getting a historian's view of Iran-Contra and not a legal one.  Both the *Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair* and the *Final Report of the Independent Council For Iran Contra Matters* assert that the Reagan Administration's actions violated the Boland Amendment.  As a result, that conclusion is frequently what you see in historical literature on the subject.  However, the Reagan Administration took the opposite position - that the Boland mmendment, as applied to members of the Reagan Administration was an unconstitutional exercise of power on the part of Congress.  This is not throwaway argument.  

While the Boland Amendment has never been tested, there have been multiple attempts to declare presidential action illegal under the War Powers Resolution, the latest of which is *Smith v. Obama* 217 F.Supp.3d 283 (2016).  Every single one of these cases has been dismissed under the Political Question Doctrine.

The Political Question Doctrine stands for the premise that the US Legal System will not intervene in cases in which the question at issue is political in nature.  The extent of the President's foreign policy power is the quintessential political question, and the US Court system has never given a ruling on such a dispute.  

Despite both Congress and the Independent Counsel claiming the Iran-Contra affair constituted a criminal violation of the Boland Amendment, the only people actually charged with that crime were Carl R. Channell and Richard R. Miller - both private citizens.  No member of the Reagan administration was actually charged for their role in selling arms to Iran or transferring money to the Contras.  This is a direct result of the fact that, although we don't have any precedent as to whether such charges would stand, no one seriously believed that they would in the face of a Political Question defense.

Rather, what members of the Reagan administration were charged for was lying to Congress during the Congressional hearings that were held into the scandal.  Reagan never lied to Congress - he may have made public statements denying his role in the affair but he never made a *sworn statement* to that effect.  Because he never made a false sworn statement, he never committed anything that was believed to be a *chargeable* crime."

"The answer to this question certainly depends on the society and also very likely on the status of a member of society. I study Mesopotamia and calendars were developed very early on and become administratively more standardized with the expanding needs of urban society in the late 3rd millennium. While you are likely to some degree correct that calendars may have been less useful prior to the development of agriculture, remember that agriculture itself was nearly 5,000 years old already by the time we find our first written evidence. So even if it were true that calendars did not appear until the development of agriculture it is impossible to really know this due to the fact that written evidence from the periods before the development of agriculture are simply nonexistent.

Outside of agriculture and administrative uses calendars can still be quite useful. For a pastoral herder keeping track of not simply the seasons but likely even the days would have been very important. They needed to move their herds to different grazing areas throughout the seasons and moving a large herd of animals is not at all an easy task to begin with. If you move your herd from the current grazing area too late especially, you risk losing parts of your herd by not reaching the grazing area in time. You would not want to be still moving your herd as the weather worsens, so it would likely have been helpful to know when it is worth moving the herd while the weather is good and not simply doing so when the weather is clearly bad.

When discussing calendars, you have to remember that creating a calendar is in ways as simple as looking up at night and noting the phases of the moon and positions of the stars. Various stars were already used as navigational tools as well; the pastoralists would follow the visibility of specific stars to know if their path was correct. If the star is ever not visible in the night then you have an easy indication that you are moving in the wrong direction. A number of stars that were particularly bright became important calendrical tools, with the most important generally being the star Sirius. If you have never known where the phrase ""dog days of summer"" comes from, it refers to the recognized connection between the first visibility of the dog star Sirius and the hottest days of the summer months. 

Another important aspect of calendars that would have been significant for nomads would be their use in organizing meetings. There were likely days where the pastoralists would come into towns to trade for products they could not get from herding sheep or goats. These markets would also have agriculturalists bringing their product and more importantly traders bringing goods from areas further away who would not stay in the market for particularly long. If you were to organize such a meeting in ancient times, the stars would realistically be the easiest way to do that. Even beyond the creation of more standardized administrative calendars timekeeping with the stars was likely still the most convenient way for the majority of people to keep track of the calendar.

Calendars were obviously immediately necessary for administrative and ritual purposes as urban society developed further. You needed to know when to collect the yearly taxes, when to perform certain festivals to the gods, when to go out campaigning in order to raid and loot nearby areas, among many other uses. The Mesopotamian calendar was a luni-solar calendar and it used the phases of the moon as its month reference but also attempted to keep the year in line with the seasons by occasionally adding an extra month to years. The lunar year, or 12 full cycles of the moon, was about 354 days, so 10 days less than the 364 day solar year. Following strictly the lunar year would result in the months moving slowly in relation to seasons, which was very bad considering so many festivals happened in relation to seasonal activities. This is also why you hear Muslims saying that a summer Ramadan can be deadly while a winter Ramadan is much easier. The Muslim calendar is a strict lunar calendar.

As to your question of birthdays, this was something that very likely did not occur until another important shift in thought by the Hellenistic period. Up to the Achaemenid Empire at least, astrology and astronomy were for the king most prominently and the kingdom itself. The Babylonian astrological omen series Enuma Anu Enlil, which consists of over 70 tablets of ""if... then"" statements relating to the positioning of the stars, is basically entirely concerned with state matters. For example, an eclipse would foretell the death of a ruler in one of four places depending on which part was eclipsed. There are numerous references to floods, crop success or failure, and other matters relating to the kingdom as a whole. These were generally unusable by the common individual, and at least for Mesopotamia during the late 2nd and early 1st millenniums we have little evidence that there was a common astrology. While we read of wealthier individuals consulting the stars, for the majority of society this was likely out of their reach.

During the Achaemenid and Hellenistic period this picture seems to have changed drastically to the point where we have found cuneiform horoscopes written for individuals. The lack of a native Babylonian king likely made the cuneiform astrological omens less important. While certainly some Persian and Greek kings paid heed to the predictions of Babylonian astrologers or at least feigned interest in them, Babylonian astrology would have found significant competition from Persian and Greek traditions building off the Babylonians. I would expect that a combination of changes from interacting with other traditions and also the rapidly deteriorating power base (and subsequently income stream) for astrologers in the court pushed them to ply their trade to more common individuals.

So to answer your question directly, this is the point where more and more people would have been interested in the exact day of their birth. Astrology uses the position of the planets in the zodiac on your day of birth most prominently, and so if you wanted to get a horoscope that was accurate you needed to know your exact birthday. I would imagine there were a lot of people who would make up a day and not be certain, but often the way you would even know your birthday was that your parents would have your horoscope cast shortly after you were born. Prior to the ""democratization"" in a way of astrology, I expect you are correct that very few if any individuals felt the need to keep track of their specific birthday, and would be content only to know the passage of months and years. 

If you would like to read more about the creation of calendars and the early Mesopotamian calendars, John Steele has written extensively on the subject. He edited a volume called *Calendars and Years: Astronomy and Time in the Ancient Near East* that is recent and would provide a good list of references to look further. He also wrote the chapter ""Making Sense of Time: Observational and Theoretical Calendars"" in *The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture*. Francesca Rochberg has written extensively on late Babylonian and Hellenistic astrology, and her book *Babylonian Horoscopes* is the best treatment of our evidence for them."

"Great answer as always from you!


Probably a dumb question, but in your table of fertility rates, I have to assume those numbers of births per 100,000?  (Some quick math seems to indicate as such given the total births and total population, but just making sure I'm not missing something....)"

I hope this generates some good responses as I'd love to hear them as well - if not, here's a related (but different) question from a couple of years ago I had saved in case it helps you find your own way:

[How accurate is the statement, ""Christian Fundamentalism is only about a couple hundred years old and creationism and biblical literalism are both very new ideas.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2el0uz/how_accurate_is_the_statement_christian/) "
"For pre-columbian, start with *From the Olmecs to the Aztecs*. Post-independence, go with Hamnett's *A concise history of Mexico*."
"Just a small correction in the Latin: **obiter**, without the ""r"" on o**r**biter."
"Our methodologies for even remotely being able to estimate that just don't exist. While there are paleogenetic studies that suggest *significant* Mediterranean or N. African ancestry (and there was one in England that suggested a post-Roman population that was roughly 10% non-white), these studies use a few dozen skeletons, *at best*. For reference, one population estimate of medieval Iceland in the 1200s suggested the population was *fifty thousand*.

There are far, far, far too many variables to suggest anything resembling an accurate count, and therefore, even though it's tempting, it is simply not a meaningful question to be considering when wondering whether any piece of Viking media is ""historically accurate"" or not.

The better choice is to do what u/Steelcan909 did and represent historical *plausibility*. We know there were non-Euro people in Scandinavia. Even if there wasn't an enormous population there or they were itinerant or anything else, it is misleading at best to completely neglect to show them (especially when the movie *cites an Arabic account of a funerary rite*)


Now, you ask an odd question - was the Norse world as diverse as today? Probably not - there's a long and relevant history of imperialism and globalization that has drawn more people together (not to mention a simply vastly higher population). But why does that matter? There was diversity recognized in the historical period from dozens of different cultures and peoples and the film does not display that historically-recognized and historically-present diversity in its cast."
"So the first thing to say here is that ""the quality of its teachings"" is not something that historians are interested in evaluating about Christianity or any other religion. History is not about arguing whether or not Christianity's theology is ""better"" or ""worse"" than the theologies of other religions. Those are questions for theologians. Whether the Resurrection of the Body or Reincarnation is a ""better"" teaching is of no interest to us as historians, even if we are bound to have personal opinions about it as people.

Now, this doesn't mean that the content of belief systems is irrelevant to the questions historians *are* looking to investigate. Historical people had tons of opinions about the ""quality of its teachings"" when it comes to Christianity and any other religion big enough to leave a historical mark. Looking at how particular groups - in this case Native Americans - evaluated the teachings of Christianity that were presented to them is an important part of historical enquiry. But crucially, this is not about an abstract comparison of theological ideals, and so the *manner in which* these beliefs were presented is equally important, arguably *more* important. Expecting people who received Christianity by force to divorce that method of delivery from the teachings being delivered is an ahistorical and farcical exercise.

Devotional Christian histories have long deployed triumphalist narratives to describe the spread of the world's largest religion. This is called ""salvation history."" Salvation history sees the history of the world as a linear movement, from the Fall to the Resurrection of Christ and the eventual salvation of all mankind. It is hard to overstate just how much salvation history used to dominate historiography in the Western world. In its earliest days as a Jewish sect, Christianity began as an eschatological movement which expected the end of the world to be imminent. Therefore, everything in history was leading up to that highly anticipated end of the world when Jesus would come again and take the believers to heaven. When this didn't happen, and continued not to happen, Christian thinkers had to rework the way they told this story, but the underlying fundamentals remained the same.

Even today, I have met conservative Christian historians who believe that, for example, orthodoxy triumphed over heresy in the Albigensian Crusades because it was *destined to happen*. Today, this view is a marginal conservative one within the discipline of history, but it has not completely disappeared, and its tentacles have spread through much of Western discourse about the colonization of non-Christian peoples. That's the baggage we're dealing with when you ask for a comparison between the ""quality of its beliefs"" and the history of Christianity's spread - because salvation history teaches that the ""quality of its beliefs"" was so great that the ends justify the means, and that the march of Christianity across the globe was pre-ordained and just.

Now, this is just the background - You are asking a slightly different question. What you want to know is whether Christianity spread more through violence or through people honestly believing it was better. The answer is that BOTH happened. I have previously written about how, for example, the spread of Christianity was [extremely violent in Saxony](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t2y8uk/comment/hypdqpv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but [extraordinarily peaceful in Ireland](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mwn3bz/comment/gvlmdvh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). In many parts of Europe, Christianity was adopted by leaders as a political tool, connecting them to an internationally powerful network of intellectual and military allies. The extent to which the populace peacefully accepted the new religion of the elites varied, with conflicts occuring in Sweden and Poland, but fewer conflicts in places like Italy or Ireland. Our friend salvation history sometimes adds a ""religious war"" element to wars between pagans and Christians where the Christians won, portraying it as a victory over paganism, even when in places like Mercia the conflict was political and had very little to do with religious ideologies.

The thing about Christianity is that it's a fundamentally evangelistic religion. The Bible teaches Christians that it is their duty to spread the ""Good News"" (Gospel) to others in order to save their souls. This ideology enables any Christian despot to use Christianity to justify the subjugation of non-Christians under the auspices of ""saving"" them. Christianity also inherited from the Old Testament and rebranded a *ton* of theology of divine kingship. Charlemagne, a zealous Christian who converted, killed, and forcibly relocated thousands of Saxons, was nicknamed David by the intellectual circles at his court. It's not hard to understand why kings and queens became such devoted Christians when it was easy to interpret their religious Scriptures as requiring divinely appointed rulers to use their power to spread the conversion of Christianity throughout the world. Especially when the clerics they surrounded themselves with actively contributed to and shaped this view.

"In 1801, James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston (the R. also stood for Robert, oddly enough) were sent to Paris not to buy the enormous swath of land subsequently called the Louisiana Purchase but to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, thereby securing the lucrative Mississippi River shipping route. Negotiations fell through, and it wasn't until Livingston returned in 1803 that Napoleon was so hard-up on cash due to the continent-wide war of conquest he was waging that he was willing to make a deal with the Americans. At the time, Livingston was authorized by Jefferson to spend up to $9 million in order to purchase New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi. Since the US was planning on making a significant purchase from France, the delegation (Monroe rejoined Livingston in Paris shortly thereafter) travelled to Paris with $3 million in gold. In 1803,[gold was worth just under $20 an ounce](http://onlygold.com/Info/Historical-Gold-Prices.asp), which means they were travelling with almost 10,000 lbs of gold. This wasn't even remotely close to the carrying capacity of freighters of the time. [""Tea Clipper"" Frigates of that time could carry twenty times that weight.](http://www.tea.co.uk/tea-clippers).

Now, the negotiations took a turn when Napoleon decided he needed more money and offered the whole Louisiana Purchase for $15 million. Livingston and Monroe were authorized by Jefferson to spend up to 9 million on New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi, so when given this offer, they had to make a decision without the President's approval, and just couldn't pass up the deal. Oddly enough, I just read the chapter describing the negotiations in Stephen Clarke's very entertaining *1000 Years of Annoying the French*.  According to Clarke, the purchase was paid for with the above-mentioned 3 million in gold as a down payment, with the cancelling of 3.75 million in debt that France owed to the US for French piracy on American ships since the revolution, and the rest was issued in bonds. Again from Clarke:

>French Banks were too nervous to accept the bonds, and two foreign banks had to step in to provide the cash. The first was Hope and Company,  a bank based in Amsterdam but set up by Scotsmen. The second was a London bank, Barings. Napoleon was in such dire straits that he agreed to sell the bonds to the banks at a 12.5% discount. 

I hope this answers your question sufficiently!

I'd like to add, though, that Tolkien's elves cannot really be said to be ""good"", though they do seem to possess an inherent nobility or ""high"" nature. 

They are often depicted as capricious, jealous, impulsive, meddlesome, short-sighted, greedy, vengeful, wrathful and lustful. There are numerous instances in *The Silmarillion* alone.

In addition, there is one elf, [Eol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6l), who is explicitly referred to as a Dark Elf. In Tolkien's mythology, elves who never journeyed West and looked on the lights of Valinor were often considered ""lesser."""

"I think there is an underlying problem with your premise here, in that you seem to assume that people are perfectly informed, rational actors. If nothing else, I hope that our present political moment would disprove that notion. The enthusiastic cooperation of, especially, Black elected officials in pursuing the War on Drugs does not disprove the evidence that the War on Drugs was underpinned by white racial ideologies. 

Consent for oppressive policy can, and often is manufactured in the same communities it oppresses, especially when it provides an *other*ing -- in this case, drug users vs non-drug users. American individualism has long privileged interpretations of social circumstances in which individuals are wholly responsible for their outcomes, i.e., bad things happen to bad people. Ergo, if something bad happens to someone, they must be a bad person. This vestigial puritanism elides systemic roots and causes, including the deliberate destruction of POC communities and their exploitation. It also explains why ""law and order"" strategies have been so successful for the political right.

The support of large segments of the Black population for the War on Drugs during the 70s-90s does not disprove the fact that it was an intentionally racist policy (see again the Ehrlichman quote), nor does it disprove the fact that the effects of the War on Drugs and mass incarceration have been deleterious and disproportionately applied to communities of color."
"Pigs were a known and feared danger in medieval cities and villages. Owners would sometimes let theirs roam the streets to scavenge for food. And occasionally that ""scavenging"" would involve walking through an open door and hurting or killing a child, almost always an infant. In the late Middle Ages, cities like Nuremberg tried multiple times to pass ordinances against letting one's pigs roam, although they seem to have been mostly concerned with, let's say, pig excrement than with them killing babies.

Edward Beatley published a short but interesting blurb pointing out that in Chaucer's *Knight's Tale* (no, not that *Knight's Tale*, sorry), one of the decorations on the temple wall is a pig eating a child: ""The sowe freten the child right in the cradel."" (Freten means to devour or to eat like an animal--a partner to the modern German ""fressen"")."

"> Social change is progressive and not always defined by a ""generational"" boundary line except in an incidental sense. To take a small example, consider the use of marijuana (a reasonable ""hippie-ness"" proxy, since the two were considered inseparable in the 60s). Gallup has been asking since 1969 if marijuana should be legalized.

> Note a very small initial support (12%) and near-steady increase then. In the supposedly-more-considervative-80s there was a slight slowdown and drop, but hardly a reversal. Support at 2020 is now at 68%. There wasn't a reversal of social norms; things steadily increased, until, in a sense, everyone became hippies.


A very quick follow-up on this specific section. There is evidence that those born in the baby boom era have more base support for marijuana legality (when asked as a yes/no question) compared to other birth cohorts. Schwadel and Ellison (2017) analyzed General Social Survey (GSS) data which has asked the yes/no legality question since 1973 with an age-period-cohort model. These models try to isolate effects from individuals getting older (age), changes over time that effect everyone (period), and differences associated with those born in the same five years (cohorts). 


The general synopsis is that most of the change in public opinion in the GSS towards marijuana legality is associated with period changes - everyone becoming more accepting of legal marijuana. However, the boomer birth cohorts have a higher level of acceptance than than other birth cohorts in the data (figure 1) especially for men (figure 2). There is also an age effect, where as people get older they have less support for legality. So even though more people are becoming ""hippies"" in their attitudes, there remains some cohort effects from the boomers in this specific yes/no outcome in the GSS data.

Thank you! "
"I know very little about the war in the Pacific, let alone the *Japanese* perspective. I can speak in some generalities which don't meet the expectations of the sub, so I would welcome someone else to weigh in there."
"When the Athenians heard of the Persian landing at Marathon, they sent the messenger Pheidippides to Sparta to ask for help. The Spartans promised to come to the aid of the Athenians, but claimed that they could not do so right away, because it was the 9th day of a new month, and the law said they could not go to war until the moon was full (apparently it was the sacred month of the Karneia, when such rules applied). This happened on the 15th day of the month, and that day the Spartans sent 2000 men to Athens. Though they marched in all haste, they arrived too late, and the battle had already been won.

This whole subplot is a sideshow to the actual battle of Marathon in our main source, the *Histories* by Herodotos of Halikarnassos. He only mentions the Spartan march briefly and says nothing about the conditions of the march or the state of the 2000 Spartans at the end of it:

> After the full moon two thousand Lakedaimonians came to Athens, making such great haste to reach it that they were in Attika on the third day after leaving Sparta. Although they came too late for the battle, they desired to see the Medes, so they went to Marathon and saw them. Then they departed again, praising the Athenians and their achievement.

-- Herodotos 6.120

That's all Herodotos has to say about the Spartan reinforcements. They came, they saw, they left. Spartan observance of sacred law meant that they missed the battle, and the Athenians and Plataians were forced to fight alone. Plutarch argued that the story about the full moon was made up by Herodotos, since the battle actually took place on the 6th day of the month, and the Spartans very nearly made it on time (*On the Malice of Herodotos* 26). Scholars have not been able to work out the correct date for the battle and resolve the conflict between Herodotos and Plutarch; either way, though, the Spartans missed the fight.

In any case, even if the Spartans had arrived on time, 2000 men did not make a very substantial force. The Athenians themselves are said to have deployed 9000, with tiny Plataiai providing another 1000 which probably amounted to its entire hoplite levy. The Spartans could have sent many more troops; clearly they didn't care enough to do what they could to save Athens from subjection to Persia. The army they sent to Athens may not have been as pathetic a token force as the 1000 men they sent to Thermopylai 10 years later, but it showed a similar reluctance to commit real numbers to any campaign outside the Peloponnese.

On the other hand, this Spartan indifference to the fate of Athens doesn't match the apparent speed of their march. The fact that the Spartans covered about 220km in 3 days* suggests that they really were doing everything in their power to make their small numbers count. Forced marches were not a regular feature of Greek warfare, and Greek armies weren't known to move anywhere near as quickly as this one. Even if we take into account that a force of just 2000 men could have done with much less of a baggage train and merchant entourage than most Greek armies, it's still true that they moved exceptionally quickly. Leonidas' 1000 Spartans seem to have taken up to two weeks to get from Sparta to Thermopylai. How do we explain the speed of the troops sent to Marathon?

The bad faith answer would be that the Spartans deliberately waited until they were reasonably sure they would be late, and then made a show of rushing north to Athens because they knew they weren't going to be fighting but needed to convince their allies that they were willing to. The good faith answer was the one given by Herodotos, that the Spartans' hands were tied by religious law but they did what they could to make up for lost time when their supporting troops finally marched out.

But both these explanations assume that the march really happened, regardless of what a typical Greek army was capable of. The alternative answer is that the forced march never took place; that the Spartans promised Pheidippides that they would help Athens, but took their time getting the troops together, and marched out at a leisurely pace. How did Herodotos know that the Spartans spent 6 days waiting for the moon and then marched for 3 days? Could it be because that's the story the Spartans spread upon their arrival? Several scholars have argued that the march of 220-260km in 3 days is physically impossible; J.P. Holoka ('Marathon and the myth of the same-day march', *GRBS* 38 (1997) 338-353) rejects it completely and insists that the Spartans would have needed at least 8 days to cover the distance.

This theory may seem unfair to the Spartans, but they definitely engaged in creative retellings of this kind. For the Thermopylai campaign, Herodotos again claims that the Karneia got in the way of the mobilisation, so the Spartans couldn't send reinforcements to Leonidas. But a close look at the chronology of the campaign shows that this is a lie. There was actually plenty of time for them to send troops before the sacred period began; the Spartans simply chose not to. Herodotos is covering for them. It's not that radical to suggest that they used the Karneia in 490 BC as an excuse not to march out at all, or to do so in their own time, and not run the risk of having to fight the Persians.

---

*) It's worth noting that we can mess around with the numbers to make them less impressive. Herodotos' claim that the Spartans arrived ""on the third day after they left"" could arguably mean ""on the fourth day of their march"". If we take literally his statement that they ""were in Attika"" that day, as in, they just crossed the border rather than arriving in Athens (let alone at Marathon), this further reduces the distance by some 20km. So perhaps the distance covered was only 50km per day rather than 70km. Others have suggested that the distance was only border-to-border, whittling it down even further, to perhaps 160km in 3 days.

EDIT: just wanted to add that the Ancient Greeks definitely did have roads, socks and boots.

EDIT 2: added some bits to reflect scholarly debate over this march. For the state of the art in scholarship, see P. Krentz, *Marathon* (2010), and C.D. Dionysopoulos, *The Battle of Marathon* (trans. N. Wardle, 2015)."

"This has always interested me as a native Hawaiian. It seems that Hawaiian names are never translated, despite seeming to fit many of the characteristics you noted - meaningful names using morphemes found in natural language, existence of a pidgin language, etc. At the same time, it definitely is true that almost all post-contact Hawaiians of historical note had Christian names, although it’s extremely uncommon for them to be used alone (Queen Liliʻuokalani is not, to my knowledge, ever referred to as Queen Lydia). The one exception seems to be Queen Emma, both because she was part-white and it seems like she rarely used her given Hawaiian name. 

But I am thinking it really relates mostly to the first points of western contact in Hawaiʻi, where there was no real need to translate names. And I suppose Hawaiian isn’t as difficult to pronounce as some other indigenous languages, or at least approximate enough to be understood."

"While the exterior of the Bundys house is in Deerfield, IL, the actual address is 9674 Jeopardy Lane.

Now, Chicago's northbound/eastbound/westbound streets dont reach the 9600s. Southbound does. So looking at the longest streets running south that remain in the Chicago city limits we can see that the neighborhoods on 96th St. axis are Vet's Park, Jeffrey Manor, Washington Heights, Beverly, and Burnside/Roseland.

Now, all these neighborhoods are working class, but they have been historically stratified by race and ethnicity. Of all the neighborhoods the ones most likely for the white Bundys to have been living in in the 1980s-1990s is Washington Heights, the only neighborhood adjacent to a neighborhood with a sizeable white population. Or the mostly ethnic white, blue collar East Beverly/Beverly.

The current average cost per square foot in Washington Heights is $129, while the city average is $243. So to round it for the sake of easy math lets say its about half as much. So lets walk that back to u/BullsLawnDan 's perfectly reasonable purchase year of 1980.

In 1980 the average house in Chicago cost $70k, so that would be $35k in Washington Heights. Using all the previously provided mortgage data and supposing Al afforded 20% down, hes going to be paying $326 on the mortgage. So I would say that he would be paying closer to $350 than $500.

So hes making $924/mo. This puts him a bit above the 28% rule, but still keeps him near the ~30% of income the average American spends on housing.

So in my personal estimation, I think he could very reasonably afford to live his 80s-90s blue collar southside Chicago life.

"Hello, while not a ""historian"" in the typical way I do have a background with graphic design and art history so I figured I would do my best to help out. There are a few reasons why a lot of older signs were designed beautifully. Before what we now know as fonts, there were books consisting of hundreds of pages of different letterforms (type styles) that one could reference, within each of the page of letterforms, there were instructions on how to draw each of the individual letters broken down into different brush strokes and the type of brush that was used to achieve that style. Something I should point out is that sign painting is a craft and a skill, there were/are schools and people dedicated to it's improvements year after year. These artists kept adjusting their style to keep up with the modern times and could reference any material that is out at the time to create new letterforms, like this Speedball Lettering textbook from 1941. https://imgur.com/a/3qH8r 

Here is a look at one of the earlier books on sign painting from 1911, while it doesn't have any letterforms, it does have details on the types of tools that are used and solutions to applying letters to one of the preferred mediums of the time: the carriage & wagon. You might notice how it also has helpful tips like ""striping, lettering, scrolling & ornamental"" and ""applying gold leaf"" as all of these skills were important to sign painting (and still are). https://archive.org/details/carriagepainting00mair 

While there are a few fields a graphic design going on at this time period, there were entire sign shops dedicated to doing only work with brushes and inks as most press printing done at this time period were done with the help of the linotype machine with a very limited selection on type styles and type size as well of other forms of type, but the printing press was not capable of dealing with larger custom pieces 2-3 feet tall. In the documentary released in 2013, Sign Painters, one of the older gentlemen who was part of a sign shop in it's heyday (in the 40's and 50's) said they had 11-13 guys on one floor slinging out showcards left and right. 

A showcard is essentially a big poster with as few words on it as possible to get the message across to the reader fast and simple. These could be words such as ""1 dozen eggs 25¢!"", ""Our brisket is the best in town"" or, as your photo shows: ""W.P.T.B. Prices unfair to labor"". It is up to the individual artist and a conversation with their client to figure out what the important words are. After this conversation is had, a show card could probably get done in about 2 or 3 minutes after a quick sketch of the overall layout (which all the showcard painters have mastered because this is their career). The cost of these show cards were considerably lower than that of a typical commercial sign, something that took more planning and execution. Most showcards were done with a limited color pallet, typically red or black ink on white paper as it is cheaper to use one color than the five or more colors it would take to paint a commercial sign or large-scale advertisement (still true today). I am unable to find an exact pricing guide, they do talk about pricing in the Sign Painters documentary which I don't own so I can't remember exact numbers, but I'm sure if there is an early edition of the Graphic Artists Guild Pricing & Ethical Guidelines book, it's in there.

The lettering styles that these artists often used in showcards were dubbed ""knockout"" type, as a pro could knock them out in a nearly a few minutes. If you notice the first two photos, all of the letter forms are essentially very similar, with some personalized variation of script styles for the bigger words and some of the smaller type's style is compensated to fit in the space (note the E's in the words ""B.C. Consumer"" in the second photo). But as you see in the third photo, the Disney animators were able to do a lot more with their signs, incorporating illustrations, multiple colors, multiple styles of type with some sporting drop shadows and others giving their type a personality of it's own (look at the word cartoon on one of the middle most signs).

I'm sure that there were people producing signs for both political parties which would be the ""good guy graphic designers"" depending on which side you were on. I hope that clears up some of your questions. Feel free to watch the Sign Painters documentary as it is super educational for anyone in the graphic arts field or just interested in type. If you have any additional questions feel free to ask.

"The rates per capita in America are significantly higher than England, Canada and Australia in the source below. I would say each share significant cultural similarity and capacity for investigation and conviction. What about American investigative infrastructure could possibly lead to significantly higher rates of identification and conviction as argued above? I think the answer is more probably a more complex set of social factors in America driving higher rates in the number of perpetrators. In the same way that a complex set of social factors seems  to have created an epidemic of school shootings and so on. I'm not pretending that I have solid answers, but I think that the arguments above that it has more to do with conviction rates is missing a step. America produces more serial killers per capita than (probably at least many) other countries, why?

"H.G. Wells is the one credited for introducing the term ""atomic bombs"" in his _The World Set Free_ (1914). He was inspired by recent work on artificial transmutation of elements and research into radioactivity, and basically imagined a bomb that would continue burning indefinitely. This, combined with other popular work, led to lots of speculation about atomic energy and atomic power and atomic bombs and so on in the 1910s-1930s, and primed people for thinking about these things once the discovery of nuclear fission was announced in 1939."

">The five or so square miles eventually enclosed by the Aurelian Walls contained the great bulk of Rome's million inhabitants.

Wait. 5 miles^2 or 13 km^2 would mean Rome had a population density of over 70,000 per km^2. How does a city without skyscrapers have a population density more than twice that of the densest modern city?

Could you talk about:

1. How was the population estimate arrived at?
2. How large was the average insulae, physically and floor space, and how many people would have lived in one?

EDIT: According to Wikipedia, [Dharavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharavi), the slums of Mumbai, has a population of between 300,000 and 1,000,000 living in an area just over 2.1 km^2. So I guess skyscrapers aren't needed after all. Still, would be interesting to know the answers to those two questions."

"We should not romanticise things too much. The marshes did not comprise some sort of peaceful, idealised peasant utopia; this was no [Cockaigne](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/exploring-the-strange-pleasures-of-cockaigne-a-medieval-peasants-dream-world). Rather, the history of Dithmarschen was characterised by numerous violent feuds between clans – most notably the one that existed for centuries between the Vodiemannen, to the south and on the coasts, and the rival Wollersmannen, who lived to the north and inland. The Ditchmarschers' *Law Book*, finalised only in 1447, contained 257 articles covering every aspect of local life and commerce in what was explicitly referred to as ""our state,"" and it resulted in the emergence of a permanent executive body comprising 48 ""regents"", each representing an important clan and holding office for life, who met weekly to govern the wider community. But it also proved woefully inadequate in maintaining internal peace, funding a government (Dithmarschers paid no taxes or tolls, and their government was funded entirely from fines) or securing the smooth running of what was, in fact, a barely-functioning ""justice system"".

The sturdy self-reliance that I mentioned earlier did have some remarkable consequences – Dithmarscher boys reached the age of majority at the age of just 11 years, six weeks, after which they were free to take any job as they saw fit. At 14, each man armed himself with a sword and spear (later a gun) and joined his local militia, and at 18 he became a full citizen, with all rights accorded to a Dithmarscher, but also a responsibility to fulfil all duties.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Dithmarscher government, though, was the existence of what might be considered a form of broad representative democracy within the territory. The society was male-dominated, but women could exercise influence and speak in the central assembly which, by the middle of the 15th century, was meeting not in Meldorp but in the busy market town of Heide. There, says Urban:

>If some party petitioned \[the regents\] to call an assembly, they would discuss it. if they agreed the matter was worth public debate, they would send \[a\] representative out to the market to announce: ""Men of our country. There is something to be said concerning our Land."" Thence the assembly would gather in the northwest corner of the square... Notice of proposed legislation was usually announced well in advance, so that all interested citizens could be present in the market square. On important occasions the entire muster of the land would appear, at which time often a thousand or more men came. They would assemble in a circle when the secretary called, and listen to his reading of letters and communications. Then the debate was opened by the most prominent of the regents. When everyone of importance had expressed his opinion, the assembly divided into three bodies for voting. If two of the three bodies approved, their decision was binding upon all Dithmarschers.

Urban goes to some trouble to explain how the Dithmarschers were nonetheless able to defend their territory effectively against outsiders for so many years. Although they had no cavalry, he says, they were ""free men"" who fought for themselves and their families, and did so cautiously, preferring to avoid fighting pitched battles on open ground. Instead, they practised piracy on the Elbe, and guerrilla tactics on land that were designed to draw mounted soldiers into the swamps that only they could navigate. Several substantial invasions were defeated in this way, in 1319, 1403, and finally 1499-1500, when 6,000 Dithmarscher farmer-militiamen who were outnumbered by two to one defeated an invasion of 2,000 cavalry drawn from Holstein and Denmark, backed by 4,000 mercenaries and 5,500 peasant levies. The general state of preparedness and local initiative maintained in Dithmarschen was well-demonstrated in the course of this invasion; having managed to cross the border undetected and advanced as rapidly as it could on Meldorp in the hope of maintaining the element of surprise, the Holstein-Danish force ran into a wedding party, which immediately transformed itself into a guerrilla infantry unit and began laying down a harassing fire that attracted the attention of other elements of the Dithmarscher militia. Throughout this period, Urban says, ""Dithmarschen was a violent land: mothers encouraged combativeness in their sons, and fathers boasted of their sons' quarrelsomeness.""

Dithmarschen did not lose its independence until 1559, when a well-planned invasion led by a noted strategist, Count Johann Rantzau of Steinburg, who was in the service of the King of Denmark, finally resulted in the division of the territory between the Danes and the counts of Holstein. The local militias were disarmed, but King Frederick wisely forbore to force change on the old peasant ""republic"" too rapidly, and named many prominent Dithmarschers among the administrators he appointed to oversee his new territory.

"I'd like to echo my colleague's sentiment when I say this: we do what we do because of people like you.

We're a diverse bunch, generally speaking, and I think it's important to note than not everyone in this community is a trained or professional historian, which is part of our mission. Oftentimes people get discouraged by our strictness when it comes to moderating, but never, in any aspect of our rules, will you find somewhere that says that you need to be a professional, published historian to contribute (I wish I was published, but then again, I wish I had anything worth publishing).

When I started contributing answers to AskHistorians, after spending a few years lurking and thinking that I could never write things as in-depth as people like /u/sunagainstgold (I still can't, lol) I never would've dreamed of becoming a flaired user, much less a moderator. 

But over my time as an active member of the community, I've come to learn that, above all else, our mission focuses around three things: accessibility, inclusivity and visibility. I love history, and I love working towards making academic scholarship more accessible to as many people as possible, while making use of my knowledge and our platform to give visibility to what I consider to be often overlooked topics and stories. But I think that every one of us, including yourself OP, are equally important members of what has grown to be my favorite place in both the internet *and* academia."
"Interesting, thanks for the information mate"
"I am not on the ground, sadly, but rather based in London – so I used three online newspaper archives: the Library of Congress's *Chronicling America* (free) and paid-for sites at [newspapers.com](https://newspapers.com) and [GenealogyBank.com](https://GenealogyBank.com).

One research tip I can offer is that while [newspapers.com](https://newspapers.com) has by far the largest archive of the three, its search engine is not very good. You find almost nothing using it simply to do a top-level search for ""Elsie Stahl"". The best results come by identifying the relevant Chicago newspapers in its archive, and doing a paper-by-paper search of them. This is a complicated process, owing to the poor quality of the search engine (which doesn't offer an obvious advanced search function). So first of all I used Chicago library catalogues to identify newspapers that were published in Chicago at the right date (I searched for 1898-1900). Then I used Google to search for \[newspaper title\] + \[[newspapers.com](https://newspapers.com)\]. This lets you access a secondary search portal that allows search by individual newspaper title, and this produces far more hits for the key words than the standard engine does.

The good news is that both [newspapers.com](https://newspapers.com) and GenealogyBank allow you to sign up for a free 7 day trial. So as long as you remember to cancel your membership within that period, it needn't cost money to use these gated resources.

The little trick concerning not taking what you're offered by the top-level search engine of any online site is one I've learned from long experience, though, and it's definitely one of my top research tips. I've used it to get hold of information that other researchers couldn't find on quite a few occasions. I also strongly recommend doing searches on multiple terms, because the OCR systems these sites use aren't anything like 100% reliable. A smudge, a tear or an unfortunately-placed end-of-column hyphenation can often fox them and lead them not to notice mention of a proper name. Once I'd got hold of the first couple of sources, I used those to leverage additional searches – and I found several additional sources by searching for ""Gottlieb Stahl"" and ""Kittie Boyer"" as well as ""Elsie Stahl""."
"There wasn't much impact to be had, the Romans were fundamentally so much more sophisticated that there was little in ways of governance that the confederations could contribute.

Roman assimilation did eradicate the identities of those peoples, it just took about 75 years (Heather covers it succinctly in his *Empires and Barbarians*). During the collapse of the west what happened was these migrating milito-aristocratic bodies from Trans-Rhenian and Trans-Danubian confederations were placed into the civil and military administration in certain parts of the empire and granted drafts on the tax revenue of those lands, to function as sort of client bureaucracies and client field armies. These peoples, however, ended up absorbing the Roman administration but didn't lose their own identity as the empire weakened, and as a result formed new identities over the course of the 5th century (the Visigoths in the 450's, the Franks really become a unified group in the 460's, etc.)"

"Any attempt answer to this inevitably has to begin with the question of ""According to whom...?"". 

American historians often regard this as a primary organizing mode of Texian (anglo-) society and ultimately, one of the major factors in the mexican-anglo political division that led to the revolution. Shortly after accepting that, disagreements abound. These disagreements largely stem from the two different modes of research: 

1) Studying the anglo revolutionaries who have so completely dominated popular narratives. The prominent political leaders of Texas were indeed intimately concerned with the preservation of slavery, texan identity, and to a lesser extent the issue of (con-)federalism.

2) Studying *everyone else*, for whom the issue of slavery was not necessarily irrelevant, but rather one issue among many (often of more import). 

Historians in the latter school would point to prior conflicts (for example the Fredonian rebellion) and nearly concurrent independence movements elsewhere in Mexico like the Yucatan republic. These conflicts illustrated that fundamental disagreements over the power of Mexico's central government in the country were ongoing for decades before and after the Texas revolution. I've discussed this in previous answers, but those links have been lost to the void. One argument along these lines is Schlereth's ""Voluntary Mexicans"" in *Contested Empire* [2], which argues that contemporaneous ideas of Mexican citizenship inherently allowed justification of revolutionary sentiments and other stated causes were simultaneously meaningful and convenient.

In popular culture though, the question of slavery is much less prominent. Popular understandings often follow Turner's frontier thesis and Barker's martyrdom of the Alamo. You're already familiar with this narrative, so there's not much to say about it except that it's became a mythos for the sorts of texans that set textbook standards.

To get back to the underlying question, most historians acknowledge that slavery was very important to anglo revolutionaries at the time of the revolutionary. However, the framing you've given, where slavery was the sole and primary cause of the revolution, ties Texas into American narratives rather than understanding them in the context of early modern Mexico. Instead, let's look at the mexican tyranny angle, a long-standing complaint of prior revolutionaries (e.g. the Long expedition). In post-independence Mexico, the issue of federalism and the strength of the central government was **the** critical issue of the day. This issue was especially important in the loosely held territories of Northern Mexico, which by the 1930s had become a warzone as conflict with indigenous groups left whole regions ruined and depopulated [3]. The failure of the central government to protect them from these and other conflicts led to questions about the effectiveness of the system as a whole. Simultaneously (and making use of legal precedent), the Mexican government had established colonial policies on the northern frontiers to stabilize the area, inviting in any who could make it work. Farther south in central Mexico, conservative factions attempted to centralize the nation away from the federalist Constitution of 1824 with the new Siete Leyes (Seven Laws) in 1835. Shortly thereafter, Zacatecas, Sonora, Alta California, the Yucatan, Tabasco, and Texas all had federalist rebellions. In Texas and the Yucatan, federalism also fell along lines of identity, a component of which in Texas for Texian society was the preservation of slavery. While slavery may have been the ultimate cause of later conflicts with which Texas was involved, by the time of the revolution it was simply a proximate (though important) cause.

"For a majority of the time that Malcolm X was in the public eye, his expenses were paid for by the Nation of Islam.  

In 1952, after he was released from prison, Malcolm worked a series of jobs: a furniture store, Gar Wood Factory, and Ford Motor Company.  During this time, he was regularly attending the Nation of Islam’s Detroit Temple Number One and was demonstrating his devotion to both the religion and its leader, Elijah Muhammed.  He also discovered his penchant for speaking to the congregation while working these jobs.  Eventually, he quit traditional working altogether in order to dedicate the entirety of his time to the Nation of Islam (NOI).  

Elijah Muhammed mentored Malcolm and began sending him places to speak for the NOI.  In 1954, Elijah Muhammed assigned Malcolm to New York City, where he was to form and become the minister of Temple Number Seven.  Although it was a struggle to get this temple up and running, it came to thrive under Malcolm’s leadership.  

In *The Autobiography of Malcolm X*: *As Told to Alex Haley*, Malcolm says, “It was in 1956 that Mr. Muhammed was able to authorize Temple Seven to buy and assign for my use a new Chevrolet.  (The car was the Nation’s, not mine.  I had nothing that was mine but my clothes, wrist watch, and suitcase.  As in the case of all of the Nation’s ministers, my living expenses were paid and I had some pocket money)” (229).

Throughout his time as a minister, Malcolm X ensured that any money he made went to the NOI, who in turn paid for what he and his family needed.  In the epilogue of his autobiography, which is written from Alex Haley’s point of view, Haley recalls Malcom’s reaction to the idea of an autobiography:  “Malcolm X gave me a startled look when I asked him if he would tell his life story for publication.  It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain.  ‘I will have to give a book a lot of thought,’ he finally said.  Two days later, he telephoned me to meet him again at the Black Muslim restaurant.  He said, ‘I’ll agree.  I think my life story may help people to appreciate how Mr. Muhammed salvages black people.  But I don’t want my motives for this misinterpreted by anybody - the Nation of Islam must get every penny that might come to me” (393). 

Years later, following his falling out with Elijah Muhammed and his ousting from the Nation of Islam, Malcolm’s lack of personal income became a challenge.  Alex Haley’s epilogue states that “A court had made it clear that Malcolm X and his family would have to vacate the Elmhurst house for its return to the adjudged legal owners, Elijah Muhammed’s Nation of Islam.  And other immediate problems which Malcolm X faced included finances.  Among his other expenses, a wife and four daughters had to be supported, along with at least one full-time OAAU \[Organization of Afro-American Unity\] official.  Upon his return from Africa, our agent for the book had delivered to me for Malcolm X a check for a sizable sum; soon afterward Malcolm X told me, laughing wryly, ‘It’s *evaporated*.  I don’t know where!’” (427).

Tragically, Malcolm did not live long enough to see his family into financial stability.  He and his family remained in the Elmhurst house until February 13, 1965, when a Molotov cocktail was thrown through a window and the house was destroyed, quite possibly by members of the Nation of Islam.  Malcolm and his wife were frantically trying to scrape together the money to buy a house of their own when he was assassinated on February 21, 1965.

"Edit: When I was working on this /u/floofyflooferi submitted an excellent answer that is now the top answer, and definitely go read that one! Some of my answer is now a bit unnecessary as the other response was removed (thanks mods) but I think still hopefully people can benefit from the larger analysis around Orientalist depictions of belly dancing that influences this question. 

No reasonable scholar of Islamic history today would still subscribe to the “Islam was so liberal before Wahabism” framework—that is not a useful description of the region nor of Islam. The MENA was neither backwards waiting for Europe to arrive nor some liberal multicultural utopia. I also fail to see what pictures of women in Iran pre-revolution have to do with belly dancing—as if Islam didn’t exist there before 1979?

So that being said, let’s talk about the history of dance in the Middle East and North Africa, the parts of the Muslim world most strongly associated with “belly dancing,” “dance of the veil,” etc. It is an immensely diverse region with many dialects spoken, religious and racial diversity, class stratification, etc. – so it therefore also has a diverse history of art and culture! Belly dancing as we usually picture it is somewhat of an amalgamation of different elements of Arab dance, including for instance hand drumming techniques, or the wearing of gold coins and other forms of ornamentation by women for special occasions (usually only weddings). There are many other forms of Arab dance that are also performed either by men or by men and women. Dabkeh is a traditional form of Arab dance common across the Levant but most strongly associated as a Palestinian dance. It is (perhaps mythically) associated with pre-Islamic cultivation or agricultural rituals, involves a lot of feet stomping with everyone in a line or semi-circle linked arm to shoulder, and nowadays frequently performed by men at weddings or by men and women together in more urban spaces or in Palestinian-American settings. Belly dancing does not really resemble any particular one of these dances. 

Much of what we in the West consider “belly dancing” emerges thus not necessarily from some true “pre-Islamic fundamentalism” dance technique or form but through performances that Western travelers to “the Orient” recorded in written travelogues, postcards, or other travel narratives to distribute to European (and later US) audiences. The term “belly dance” arrives to us not from any Arabic translation but from a translation of French Orientalists description in the late 19th century. Malek Alloula describes not just belly dancing but the larger phenomenon of photographic postcards of Algerian “harems,” odalisques, etc as both “stereotype and phantasm,” a crucial part of the French colonization of Algeria. Algerian women became both desired and to be held at arm’s length. The Western photographer sending back postcards of belly dancers was showing both his privileged status of getting access to the “closed harem” as what he portrayed as an objective scientific western observer documenting traditional native life (which was pretty much always staged for the photographer’s lens), while also leaning into to the lewdness and sexualization of Algerian women. Veiled women’s bodies stood in for the land of Algeria – waiting to be conquered and penetrated by French men (colonists and conquered), yet also inaccessible, mysterious, desirable. There is a lot of great scholarship that is a bit beyond the scope of this question about how the veil actually became a tool of Algerian resistance during the revolution that kicked out the French (Fanon writes about it quite a bit, somewhat problematically at times), but short aside there is that wearing the veil actually became an anticolonial symbol against French imperial secularism. Veiled women, often assumed to be docile and apolitical, would actually smuggle in bombs under their coverings. 

The US got on the belly dancing train particularly after the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, which included belly dancers in an exhibit. Amira Jamarkani argues that these belly dancers, who then had their photographs distributed on postcards, served less as some actual representation of Arabic dance practices than as a source of displaced American anxiety: about industrial progress and concurrent social change; the US as an imperial-power-in-waiting anxious about its state in the world; and the internalized disgust at women’s bodies of the Victorian era – shaming these belly dancers was a useful way to thus hold up white women’s “proper behavior” domestically as opposed to these “savage undulations.” Jamarkani even compares the way the belly dancers were discussed and their images circulated to minstrel shows which maintained a certain racial order in the US. This continued into the 20th century. Ella Shohat, in writing about the history of Orientalism in Western cinema, describes how belly dancing was really just a mash up of a lot of different “Eastern” cultures to feed American audiences hungry to see “the harem”: “films often included eroticized dances, featuring a rather improbably melange of Spanish and Indian dances, plus a touch of belly-dancing (The Dance of Fatima, The Sheik, and Son of the Sheik (1926)). This filmic practice of melange recalls the frequent superimposition in Orientalist paintings of the visual traces of civilizations as diverse as Arab, Persian, Chinese, and Indian into a single feature of the exotic Orient.” This continued and had a resurgence in the 1970s with the Arab oil embargo and the rise of US interest in the Middle East, which saw another rise of belly dancing and harem depictions in US movies and television. 

Essentially or TL;DR: Our idea of “belly dancing” is historically inaccurate, has little or nothing to do with a “pre-Islamic fundamentalist” utopia of the Middle East, and much more to do with Western fantasies of Muslim and Arab women linked to historical colonization and imperialism in the region.

"I have an earlier answer that addresses part of your question!

* [
Is it true that women couldn't buy property in the US prior to 1974?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/536nnx/is_it_true_that_women_couldnt_buy_property_in_the/d7qlw68/)

Goodness gracious no. And the Equal Credit Opportunity Act referenced in that post, while it does indeed prevent discrimination on the basis of marital status, is about the extension of credit (loans), not possession of property.

That said, the inclusion of marital status in the act (Title VII of the Consumer Credit Protection Act) was part of the final death of *coverture* in the US.

America was a British colony and thus derives its law code in large part from English common law, including the doctrine of coverture. Under coverture, married women were not actually legal persons--they were essentially treated like legal minors under their husbands' authority. All property was joint property (including any wages earned) and husbands had final say; women could not sue in court, make contracts, or buy and hold their own property. 

Note that in America as in England, this applied to *married* women, or feme couvert (""covered"" women). Widows and single adult women were classified as feme sole, full legal persons who could independently buy, own, and sell property, make contracts, and represent themselves in court.

The practical realities, enforcement, and effects of coverture are a contentious question in scholarship whether you're talking about the fifteenth century or the nineteenth. However, from the mid-ish 19th century to the 1970s we see a gradual ebbing away at coverture on a *legislative* level--on a state by state basis. (You'll notice that these two periods correspond to periods of flourishing women's rights activity. Not a coincidence.)

In the 1970s, some degree of coverture laws continued to apply in U.S. states like Louisiana, although very few of them. A series of Supreme Court decisions extended equal protection laws to marital status, which feminist legal scholars have considered to mark the final death of coverture. (I think this is why the AskReddit user's source picked out the 1974 law as significant, although not the significance that the post claims). Louisiana's ""head and master"" law, which legally placed the husband in control of the marriage and marital assets, was finally abolished by the Supreme Court in 1981 in Kirchberg v. Feenstra."
"  It was with good reason that the chosen weapon of assassins in the Middle Ages was the dagger. The list of major figures killed by crossbow is relatively short (even shorter if you rule out hunting accidents) but the number of major medieval figures who were stabbed to death is pretty long. John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy; Louis I, Duke of Orleans; John Comyn III of Badenoch; and Conrad of Montferrat (him by the actual Assassins of fictional Creed fame) to name just a few deaths that had major political repercussions. The list grows even longer if you count survivors, Saladin survived multiple attempts while Edward I was stabbed while on Crusade and recovered. The knife was the preferred weapon of assassins and it’s understandable why. With a knife you can hide it until you’re up close and personal and that intimacy makes it easier to ensure that your target is really dead or dying. People survive crossbow wounds – Joan of Arc was famously shot through the leg early in her military career and recovered – but stab someone enough times and they’re very unlikely to get better, especially with medieval medicine being what it was. In many ways Richard I was unlucky, a few centuries later a young Henry V took an arrow to the face and survived to go on and have a very successful military career before ignobly dying of dysentery.

This answer’s a bit rambling but hopefully it conveys the overall point. There’s no mention in the historical record for dedicated snipers in the Middle Ages and there are quite a few factors underpinning that – not the least being that even being a professional soldier was a rarity at the time, let alone a specialist – but hopefully this brief account of a people what shot at other people in the past helps make clear some of the difficulties with trying to have someone killed by crossbow.

Sources: 

I mentioned primary sources in the text, but on Richard I a great summary is John Gillingham's article ""The Unromatic Death of Richard I"", it's a little old and I don't know if I'd stand over every argument he makes in it, but it really covers the sources and is a great jumping off point. 

As I said, the chronicler Orderic Vitalis is the best source on the attempt on Henry I. As far as I'm aware nobody devotes much attention to it in scholarship of the time - because he survives it's more of an interesting anecdote of a specific feud than a momentous shift in his reign. 

General crossbow histories are rare, but Josef Alm's *European Crossbows: a Survey* remains the best on the subject while Hardy and Strickland's *The Great Warbow* is probably the best single book on medieval archery going. Bradbury's *The Medival Archer* is also great, though, and has the benfit of being cheaper and generally in print, so that's nice. 

I don't have any recommendations on the history of assassinations, the section at the end is just drawn from reading about periods of history where those assassinations happen. For John the Fearless and Louis I (John actually has  Louis killed and is later killed himself as revenge), Green's *The Hundred Years War: A People's History* is a great survey that covers most of what you need to know underpinning those events. John Comyn's assassination is well trod scholarly ground but I know most of what I know about it from Barrow's biography of Robert Bruce (the man who killed Comyn). Saladid and Conrad of Montferrat will be covered in basically any book about the Third Crusade and Edward's near death is featured in most if not all biographies of the king."
"One of the truisms in education history is that every school, including every college and university, has its own history. Cornell ended up in the NCAA Ivy League due to the political connections of the founders and early boards. Basically, the two Senators who were part of the founding of the college pressed enough flesh to establish their student population had the bone fidas to fit in with the Colonials. 

Stanford was modeled after Cornell and did a similar type of political networking to gain the attention of men in power and draw their attention, and their children, to the college. Unlike East Coast colleges, Stanford had a bit more space around norms and could establish itself as a coeducational, modern campus. So, there was less pressure to adhere to the classical curriculum and more ability to create new branches of study.

And a total non-shocker, Hopkins found its footing under the guidance of a number of college presidents, including Charles Eliot of Harvard who had his hand in nearly everything college-related in the late 1800s, early 1900s. He helped get Daniel Coit Gilman, a Yale man, in as president as the rest is, as they say, history.

In effect, new universities achieved high esteem because they were endorsed by the old guard. Basically, they were welcomed into the club."
That was a wonderful read on a topic I had previously known almost nothing about.  Thanks for priming my search on what to read next.

"By and large, it appears that most, if not all people who worked in politics were shocked, even his enemies - and publicly morned his death, at least for a short while. While Adams and then president Jefferson lamented Alexander's death in 1804, they both took shots at his beliefs and legacy in the following years. When Adams penned his own autobiography years later, he would write of Hamilton, ""Vice, folly, and villainy are not to be forgotten because the guilty wretch repented in his dying moments.” 

Privately, others seemed to see this unexpected death as something that they could use to their advantages. ""James Madison seemed less concerned with Hamilton’s death than the exploitation of it by his Federalist opponents.""

"I can't answer this question from the perspective of the average medieval peasant, but I can give some information about the medieval Roman (or Byzantine) state and how they dealt with wounded during campaign.

To start I want to give a bit of background on the combatants I'm talking about. In the 10th century CE the standard soldiers of the Byzantine Empire were the Stratiotai. Stratiotai are distinguished from free peasants by their military service, service that came with certain economic, social, and legal benefits unique to the them. That being said, most Stratiotai were still farmers, farming plots of land next to their peasant neighbors. Hopefully this qualifies as close enough to your question to be helpful, but I want to make sure the distinction is apparent.

On campaign, Stratiotai were required to equip and provisions themselves. While the state, family, or community would assist in documented situations, the expectation was the solider would show up when summoned for campaign prepared. For example, the Praecepta Militaria lays out the following recommendation for equipment alone:

    • short tunics extending to the knees, of cotton or coarse silk.
    
    • short boots folded up to the knees or unfolded up to the thighs.
    
    • thick caps of felt fastened over their heads with bands of cloth.
    
    • sword, axe, or iron mace. Stored at the waste on a belt.
    
    • sling stored in the belt.
    
    • Shields no smaller than six spithamai.
    
    • thick and solid spears, from twenty-five to thirty spithamai in length.

In addition, soldiers were required to bring provisions and the means to carry them. Once again from the Praecepta Militaria,

*""If possible, they should travel everywhere on foot, each pair of men with one mule to carry their shields, spears, and provisions. ""…""each group of 4 must have one man whose responsibility it is in time of battle  to watch over their animals, baggage, and provisions. Those on foot unable to keep up with the cavalry because of the length of the march or fatigue should have an extra mule each to carry him and bring along their provisions. Their attendants must follow on foot. ""*

Not only were more obvious things like equipment and provisions required, but also pack animals and potentially servants could be shared between groups of soldiers. Speaking of groups it's important to understand how these soldiers were organized. The most basic organizational unit of the Byzantine army during this period was the banda. This unit changed in size over time but the Praecepta Militaria mentioned about 50 men. It also mentions *""see to it that kinsmen with kinsmen and friends with friends are assigned to each one so that they live and take meals together in camp, on the march, and everywhere. ""* By now we're starting to paint a slightly different picture than the lone peasant whisked away to war in a far away place alone and with nothing but the shirt on his back. In the Byzantine army of this period we have groups on kinsmen, or at least men who were familiar with each other, receiving the muster and marching to war together as a cohesive unit. Well equipped and provisioned, likely with horses, pack animals and potentially servants to help on the march.

If one of them was to become wounded in battle, we can look at an earlier source, the Strategikon, for insight,

*""In addition to the above, either or ten of the less skilled soldiers in each tagma should be assigned as medical corpsmen to each bandon, especially in the first battle line. They should be alert, quick, lightly clothed, and without weapons. Their duty is to follow about a hundred feet to the rear of their own tagma, to pick up and give aid to anyone seriously wounded in the battle, or who has fallen off his horse, or is otherwise out of action. ""*

And a later source, an anonymous treatise known as Campaign Organization and Tactics, for what happens after battle,

*""on the march into the enemy's country the monoprosopa (wagons and extra horses) carry the armament and all the other siege equipment. But when they leave it, most of the missiles, and the other equipment, and arms will have been expended. The monoprosopa should then be divided into three sections""…""the third should go to the troops in the saka, so that they can convey the wounded, those who are so weak they might fall behind.""*

Unfortunately, I don't know of any Byzantine sources that directly mention how wounded soldiers are returned home. That being said, we have enough evidence to piece together at least some idea. Byzantine soldiers went to war with their kinsmen, generally from the same town or geographical area as them. They also brought servants and pack animals. It seems likely that if the corpsmen were able to retrieve a wounded soldier from the battlefield and get him back to camp, they had spare pack animals, wagons, and assistants to see to it that that man received basic care and transportation until the campaign was over. At the conclusion of a campaign, it sounds plausible that the banda returned home together, using these same resources to assist any who were too injured to make the journey on their own."
I’m curious what the most popular name was that single other year?
"So, my main source of information to match what Coogan has to say is actual word of mouth. As a reference point, I spoke to one High Level IRA member (possibly Army Council at some point - not that any of them admitted to any level of authority), one local area Commander, and then several low level, but very active 'Volunteers'. I don't have a figure to give you, I doubt a number approaching exact will ever be known. However what Coogan says does ring true. In the areas where the IRA was most active there was a 'active' British Government response. Unfortunately, the response was often heavy handed (the tools the British Government used were a Police Force who were strongly anti Irish and young soldiers who had no idea why they were really there). So, you can imagine the level of 'hearts and minds' at place. As a result, the IRA had a large amount of passive support with the Catholic populace - it was not universal of course, but a lot. In terms of numbers, the feeling I got during the interviews (this was mostly with members from the 80's and 90's) that we are talking about double digits active at any one time. We also need to consider what we are talking about, the IRA, like most 'armies' needed a large contingent of rear echelon men to support the people who did the shooting and bombing. Quartermasters, bomb makers, strategists etc etc. If we count them as well we might start getting the figures that Coogan cites. However, when people talk about the IRA they think of men in balaclavas so I think double digits is likely correct. The IRA men I spoke to who were active in the early 90's indicated that they operated in small cells of 3-4, however they largely operated alone, likely to avoid being caught in groups (like the IRA unit ambushed by the SAS in Drumnakilly). I am hesitant to trust academic sources on the IRA because IRA members generally do not speak to anyone they don't know, also the IRA did not keep records in anyway that would allow us to calculate an accurate number. Ex IRA members are still under threat of arrest and bodily harm if they are found out, so we are unlikely to hear anything direct on this topic (there is a website run by some undesirable folks with a list of suspected IRA members).

Regarding the move from a mass movement to a more underground one – yes, this appears to be correct. The IRA was finding it difficult to build up a strong base of experienced volunteers due to the number being arrested due to the intelligence agencies working against them. It would appear to me that the IRA was initially delighted with the level of support received, but when it became clear that it would not be a short war they moved to more ‘professional tactics’. Bandit Country (Toby Harnden) does a good section on this. He also talks about the good and bad side to the arms influx from Gaddafi in which he talks about IRA members throwing guns away after an attack instead of taking them back. This was because weaponry was then so plentiful but it also points to a drop in the quality of the volunteers.

In terms of ‘doing more’. Yes, people who wanted to achieve Irish Independence could resort to political means. However, they were still subject to arrest, threat of death and indeed death itself by either the police, army or Loyalist paramilitary groups. Having anything to do with Republicanism in Northern Ireland during the troubles was a very dangerous thing to do (have a read of the book ‘Lethal Allies by Anne Cadwallader).

"My understanding is that Polynesians did not take pigs everywhere. Prior to European contact, there were no pigs in New Zealand nor in Rapa Nui (Easter Island). The latter is significant to your question because it's the closest place to South America we can prove Polynesians visited and may well have been either the point of departure for a Polynesian visit to South America or where South Americans on their own boats met Polynesians. If so, probably no pigs!"
"Thank you for an excellent answer. I would just like to add one thing: most surviving manuals like Danzig primarily describe duels or small engagements using swords from the 14th century onwards with no shields. So if OP's question is to be taken literally, asking about *swordfights* this is exactly what answers it.

However, if interpreted a little more broadly to include fights with more people, and/or using shields, it seems to be a bit different. Without a shield, the stress is on lightning-quick, aggressive and decisive moves, meaning a fight is often over in seconds. With shields, however, it could sometimes turn into more of a game of attrition. The Norse sagas and other older sources like Beowulf frequently speak of fights lasting until both opponents were exhausted and, if supplied, could have used up several shields. Now, these are not exactly sober and accurate accounts, but they were written for an audience that often had first-hand knowledge and would probably not have wanted to describe fights in a way that the audience would find ridiculous. For what it is worth this also seems borne out by personal experience in the Norwegian version of live steel fighting using a variety of weapons with and without shields."

"Henry died in a joust against the captain of his Scottish Guard, Gabriel, the Count of Montgomery.  The fateful run occurred at the end of a tournament day, after Montgomery had almost unhorsed the king.  Henry instead on another tilt.  Montgomery's lance struck the king's helmet and shattered, with a long splinter running through the king's visor through his eye and into or near his brain.  The king initially survived injury, and was attended to by two of the most celebrated physicians in Europe, Ambroise Paré and Andreas Vesalius.  The queen, Catherine de Medici, ordered four prisoners executed with wood driven into their brains so that the physicians would have the chance to study the king's wound in detail on the corpses.  Despite this rather extraordinary measure, the king deteriorated steadily.  Vesalius' personal account is consistent with the development of meningitis or encephalitis.  After 11 days, the king died.

During these 11 days, Montgomery is supposed to have come to the king's side, and asked to have his head and right hand cut off in punishment.  The king told him that he had jousted well and bravely and that the accident was not his fault.

Following Henry's death, Catherine essentially ruled through a series of three of her sons.  Montgomery retired to his estate in Normandy.  From there, his history gets a bit complicated.  He converted to Protestantism and took part in the religious fighting in Bourges and Rouen that followed the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572.  He escaped to England and remained there for about a year, later returning to attempt to lead a Huguenot insurrection in Normandy.  He was captured by royal forces and executed in 1574.

"Thank you to lcnielsen, great comment! While reading it, I had a follow-up question occur to me, both that comment and the OP in general.

While legacy is certainly a massive part in the bias, is it also possible that the settled-nomad dichotomy is at play as well? 

As far as I can remember my uni classes, most settled peoples had a very lowly view on nomadic peoples, and for some living closer to these groups, outright feared them (e.g. China). Chinggis' rule seems to be far more lenient than most conquerors' (that is, if your city surrendered), yet it is rarely remembered for its tolerance for religion or opening of safe trade routes. Are there any reasons to to believe this attribute plays into this as well?"

"The Germans were derogatively called Huns, but that was more a problem of Wilhelm II's making rather than an inventive British campaign. He made a speech in 1900 to troops leaving to fight in the Boxer Rebellion in which he said:

The first one is the concept of Realpolitik, a German term that refers to a specific systemic approach to geopolitics, which has existed for thousands of years. It is directly associated with pragmatism and realism, and its essence is this: considering the facts of a matter, the specific circumstances and characteristics of an event, as well as carefully analysing the consequences of an action, should be more important than any ideological considerations. Some figures associated with Realpolitik are Niccolo Machiavelli, Otto von Bismarck and, more recently, Henry Kissinger and someone I mentioned in my previous answer, Charles de Gaulle.

&#x200B;

Realpolitik is important because it was the ruling system in NATO foreign policy during the end of the sixties and the first half of the seventies. Why? Because of the second concept, Détente.

&#x200B;

Détente is a diplomatic term that means the relaxation of tensions between countries through the use of diplomacy. When Nixon became president and named Kissinger as a National Security Advisor in 1969, they began a strong campaign, both within the US and with their European allies, to ease tensions between themselves and the ""West"", and the USSR. It's paramount that we keep in mind that during the entirety of the Cold War, even though many European countries and the US were involved in foreign wars, their primary, continuing concern was focusing on their relations with the USSR, and viceversa. This meant both good, bad or neutral, depending on the period of the War and also on their respective leadership. During the détente, which lasted approximately until Reagan's election, this focus meant keeping a unified front, despite their internal disagreements.

&#x200B;

Therefore, taking these two concepts into consideration, we have a reason as to why, even though some countries in NATO were on opposite sides of the Nigerian war, their diplomatic relations were still aimed at the ""bigger picture"" so to speak.

&#x200B;

For further reading on the matter I recommend Kissinger's *Diplomacy*. For a deeper understanding of the concept of Realpolitik, I suggest reading Eric Hobsbawm's *The Age of Empire: 1875-1914* and Esther Barbé's *The Balance of Power in International Relations Theory.*"
"I recently read Anthony Kaldellis's book [*The Byzantine Republic*](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674365407) in which he makes a very strong argument that the Romans continued to view their state as a Republic well into the Byzantine era, all the way up to the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire in 1453. His argument is that, at the time of Augustus, the people viewed the oligarchical control the rich had over the Senate as a form of tyranny. His argument is that repeatedly through Roman and Byzantine history, it was the people who gave legitimacy to the emperors, not the emperors themselves. Even though they didn't have any codified legal mechanism in place to formally influence imperial policy,the crowds in the streets, if sufficiently motivated, could overthrow an emperor through the use of violence. Indeed, even late into the Byzantine era, emperors were acclaimed (in heavily stage managed political theater) by the people and the senate. Historically, this has been viewed as cynical manipulation, but Kaldellis argues that it was a necessary step for an emperor to gain legitimacy.

I'm sure I'm butchering his central point, and leaving out a lot of important evidence to back it up. It's quite a compelling argument, though. On a day-to-day basis, a Roman citizen living through the rise of Julius Cesar and Augustus wouldn't have said, ""well, it was really nice to have political freedom under the Republic yesterday, but it kinda sucks that we live in a monarchical empire now."" They actually viewed the rise of Augusts as a return to the republican ideals of Roman government *because he was acclaimed by the people and his power voted by the Senate.* Part of Kaldellis's argument is that the term ""Republic"", when referring to scholarship on Rome, has always been influenced by our modern understanding of a Republic. He argues that the Roman people didn't think of the Republic as a governmental body in which people voted for representatives who were then administrators of the government for the people. They thought of the Republic as the entire body of Roman citizens, the geography of the state, and the governmental institutions, and that all of this exists to serve the needs of the people. When the government was doing a poor job (ie the people disapproved of the Emperor), the people had the right to change their representative leaders by violently overthrowing them. In this formulation, an Emperor is not the man (or woman, in the case of Irene) serving in the position. The Emperor is an office which is occupied by an individual. If that individual did not satisfactorily live up to the office, then they should go.

He also makes a strong argument that this is part of why there was never a codified succession plan in either Rome or Byzantium. The currently serving emperor didn't have the right to determine who the next emperor was, that was the responsibility of the people. Now, obviously, the emperors would try to influence the people's decisions, by naming their chosen successor Caesar, or appointing them to key military/governmental posts. If the people didn't like the successor, though, then a rival with more public support could almost certainly seize power for themself.

Have you heard this argument before? How does it fit in with your understanding of when the Romans ceased to believe they lived in a Republic?"
"That answer confuses me somewhat. In particular, this:

> The problem with Devereaux' post is that he seems to be about 3 decades behind on the scholarship, and views on Spartan customs have changed a lot in that time. He doesn't seem to be aware of any of the major research done on the Spartan upbringing since Cartledge's work from the 1970s. Nigel Kennell and Stephen Hodkinson (among others) have done much to overturn the old idea that Spartan children were stolen from their parents at age 7 and raised to be killing machines. **They focus instead on the values the education system meant to instill, and on the evidence that children (and adults) had a lot more going on in their life than preparing for war; they also point out that there's really no evidence that the upbringing involved any actual training for war. In their view, the Spartan education as it existed in the Classical period focused on creating good citizens, not good warriors.** It was admired by other Greek elites because its cornerstones and chief goals were the same values they also pursued in the upbringing of their own children: **obedience, deference to elders, and commitment to the community.**

(Emphasis mine)

Because that seems mostly to be in line with what Bret was saying, even though apparently his knowledge was outdated?"
"I'm afraid I can't give a general answer to this, but I can give an example from the Battle of Evesham in 1265 of soldiers wearing distinguishing marks.

My answer comes from Christopher Tyerman in England and the Crusades, 1095-1588, who in turn cites Flores historiarum and William Rishanger's De Bellis.

Simon de Montfort instructed his Baronnial forces to wear white crosses on the front and back of their armour, which I take to mean either stitched onto either padded gambesons or surcoats, ""to distinguish each other from the enemy and to demonstrate that they were fighting for justice.""

At Evesham, the future Edward I followed suit and his men were instructed to wear red crosses on their arms, and Tyerman writes that two royalists who hadn't worn the symbol were mistakenly killed by their own side.

Tyerman also suggests that the use of the red cross by Lord Edward in the Second Baron's War was a precursor to its adoption by his grandson Edward III, though obviously this was related to the St George as a Patron St of Soldiers, rather than the 'Political Crusade' which Tyerman attributes the wearing of crosses in the Second Barons War to.

I hope this answer helps and has been satisfactory for everyone who reads it. If I had any other examples I'd give them but 13th century England is an area of interest for me, so this was all I could bring to mind."

">After 9/11 the US finally had to “clean house” in Afghanistan.

I think an important detail is that when the US invaded in 2001 the new government formed in Afghanistan was mostly compromised of former Mujahedin leaders, the same warlords that the Taliban had previously overthrown/fought against. I think it's important because the Afghan civil war in the 90's between the Mujahedin had made them unpopular and restoring Mujahedin rule over Afghanistan didn't make the US occupation popular, which I believe at least gives a partial explanation why there has been a Taliban resurgence.

"To take it across the border, one can look at Canada's relationships with First Nations as well, and much of the pre-Independence English colonies, was the Royal Proclamation of King George that all treaties and deals with various nations were to be done 'fairly.'

The proclamation of course is nullified for the States post-Independence, but in Canada it was a basis for treaties being established in terms of land purchases. In exchange first Nation groups were continually promised land ""reserved"" for them and financial or agricultural equipment to help start themselves in their new territory. As with most other colonial countries the government reneged on the deals and typically never fulfilled payments or argued that they had already paid in full.

It never helped relations that some of these treaties were written in particular words and such that the nuace was lost on Chiefs and Elder Councils.

So *theft* in a contemporary concept has become more prevalent as the truth has come out with less racial bias against the ""uneducated savages"" as it were.

"California is interesting demographically, along with other states like Florida and Nevada, for their consistent high population growth ever since statehood, leading to large potential student populations.

One must be careful of where they obtain these period rankings of universities, making sure they were actually published at the time, instead of a modern ranking of how the author perceived the institutions to have performed in the past, potentially colored by other modern assessments of their reputation and performance. Moving away from the 1920s, the concept of widely-disseminated, ""universal,"" lists of college and university rankings is also relatively recent. In their 2009 article *Rating the Rankings*, Wendy Espeland and Michael Sauder explain that **prior to the 1980s, compact lists of comprehensive comparative rankings of U.S. colleges universities were not widely available to the general public, being produced only for the information of ""academic insiders.""** This changed in 1983, when *U.S. News and World Report* published their first set of comprehensive college and university rankings. Other publications soon followed suit, and this system has even grown to have a small subfield in academia dedicated to studying it and its effects on the psychology of institutions.

In their 2010 article *U.S. News & World Report College Rankings: Modeling Institutional Effects on Organizational Reputation*, Nicholas A. Bowman and Michael N. Bastedo determined that ""published college rankings have a significant impact on future peer [i.e., fellow institution] assessments, independent of changes in organizational quality and performance and even of prior peer assessments of reputation."" Such is the case of Oberlin College:

> In 1983, when U.S. News & World Report published its first set of college rankings, Oberlin College ranked fifth among the nation’s liberal arts colleges. This was hardly surprising as the ranking was based entirely upon reputation among its peers, and Oberlin had a long and storied history. It had a particularly strong reputation for placing students in top graduate programs, for decades ranking first among liberal arts colleges in the number of students who ultimately earned the doctorate (National Science Foundation 2006). Four years later, in 1987, Oberlin remained in the fifth position; the next year Oberlin was stunned to fall completely out of the top 10. Beginning in 1988, the *U.S. News* rankings methodology began to include quantitative measures of student and institutional characteristics that it believed were more objective measures of quality, and consequently peer reputation became a progressively smaller part of the overall ranking. Oberlin did not score at the top of these new measures, and its ranking suffered. By the mid-1990s, Oberlin was in serious danger of falling out of the top 25, which U.S. News defined as the “top tier” of liberal arts colleges. More curiously, Oberlin’s peer reputation suffered during the period as well, over time moving closer and closer to its overall ranking, despite having changed little over the years. Was Oberlin no longer as good as it thought it was? Or were the rankings damaging its reputation among college leaders, even while its quality remained relatively unchanged?

In their 2011 article *Anchoring Effects in World University Rankings: Exploring Biases in Reputation Scores*, Bowman and Bastedo hypothesized that the anchoring effect has a major role in the determination of college and university rankings, and then came to the conclusion that it actually does have a strong effect on future university rankings after the release of the initial list. The anchoring effect is a psychological concept wherein a subject depends heavily on an initial piece of information (in this case, an initial set of college and university rankings) in the course of making future decisions (future releases of institutional rankings), allowing well-established, frequently very old, institutions to cement their places on lists. This works against newer, less-established institutions, who must first develop a reputation among their peers, as well as among the general public and potential students, that includes a strong track record of research and sending a high percentage of students to, and preparing them to successfully complete, graduate and post-graduate programs. 

""Universal"" rankings systems that try to place a variety of institutions on one list can also be harmful because of pigeonholing. Citing a previous article by Kimberly D. Elsbach and Roderick M. Kramer (*Members' Responses to Organizational Identity Threats: Encountering and Countering the Business Week Rankings*), Bowman and Bastedo also contended that the prestige of achieving a certain place in a list can lead to a ""crisis of institutional identity."" Espeland and Sauder said that this can cause institutions to completely change their academic and research focus in order to compete with others in yearly rankings; journalist Peter Sacks explained the ""dangers of using standardized or even universal metrics to evaluate schools doing fundamentally different jobs of offering specialized forms of education"" and that ""judging schools according to a single set of criteria ignores the fact that schools have different aspirations and punishes those with distinctive or non-elite missions."" These rankings can also have an effect on student behavior in selection of institutions to attend, as they act almost like consumers of a product.

> As many in higher education believe that the U.S. News rankings are shallow or even misleading (McDonough et al. 1998; Thacker 2005), and acknowledging the widespread evidence that rankings have significant effects on college choice at both undergraduate and graduate levels (Bowman and Bastedo 2009; Martins 2005; Monks and Ehrenberg 1999; Sauder and Lancaster 2006), the additional institutional effects of U.S. News on expert opinion are particularly significant. From a methodological perspective, this effect may distort the quality of the reputation scores that are used in calculating the rankings. The more that the reputations of colleges are affected by the ranking, despite other evidence to the contrary, the more the U.S. News rankings become college reputation. Reputation scores are thus likely to have decreased value over the long run.

"None whatsoever.  I knew this would come up since it almost always does when Salem comes up.  This myth continues to spread and I'm sure will follow me to the grave.  So many of my friends love to joke with me and say ""wasn't it something to do with the wheat"" because how wrong it is.

&#x200B;

So lets get into it.  Ergot is a fungus that under the right weather conditions will grow, and yes 1692 would have had the condition.  It causes convulsions and a hallucinogenic effect.  On the outset, it seems like it would make sense- the afflicted in Salem were convulsive and had visions.

&#x200B;

But these symptoms don't fully line up with ergotism.  The afflicted convulsed, but were able to do it on command at times- in one example a girl fell into fits after her mother spoke harshly to her.  The fits also got them out of doing chores so the convenient timing compels me to believe that these weren't accidental or medical symptoms.  The girls also rarely complained about some of the side effects like nausea or vomiting.  Aside from the convulsion, they were generally healthy.  

&#x200B;

For the visions, ergot has a similar function like LSD- it distorts your vision.  The accusers had crystal clear visions of suspects, offering physical descriptions and sometimes able to add details if pressed for information.  Ergot doesn't make you see your neighbor.  The accusers knew the people they 'saw'.  Just in medical terms, this theory doesn't hold up.

&#x200B;

There is also the geographic spread of the afflictions.  Girls across Salem Town and Salem Village suffered afflictions.  Then other towns joined in later.  We know that ergot couldn't be so widespread across Essex County so as a main source it makes no sense.  Could the first few case been ergot and others copied?  I also doubt it- not every member of a household suffered- other young children were fine, sometimes adults were afflicted in cases but less often than the children.  Its just unlikely that only select family members would suffer if ergot were present.

&#x200B;

Then why does this myth persist?  My guess is that its easier to take in quickly.  19 people hanged, about 150 people were arrested, and 893 unique accusations were made.  It happened because people made calculated actions as scenarios unfolded that harmed and killed others.  If we blame ergot, we can pretend it won't happen again.  If we blame the Salem Witch Trials on people, we have to accept that it can and does still happen and that we all can help cause it.  Ergot seems to put a nice bow around it so we can ignore that humans are capable of turning on each other and utilizing fear to turn a system against our neighbors.  I doubt the myth will go away anytime soon since its a simpler reality."

"Thank you so much for doing this AMA with us. *Searching for Black Confederates* was one of the most insightful books I've read of recent, and I could pick your brain about it for awhile, but I'll try not to overwhelm and keep it to a few.

One of the most interesting points was your discussion of Douglass and his willingness to uncritically peddle reports of entire units of black men under arms for the traitors, and within that, John Parker seems to jump out the most. What do you make of his entire testimony? I stands out as quite interesting to me because even if taken *entirely* uncritically it only can speak to a handful of men forced under gunpoint to assist in battery operation, and thus really *doesn't* support Douglass all that well even given full credence, but given the context in which Douglass used his recollections, it seems hard to even give that small incident our full credulity.

Looking more modern, what do you feel motivates scholars like Henry Louis Gates to peddle the Black Confederate myth? To be frank, I was quite taken aback to discover his involvement in its continued existence, and it kind of soured me on his other scholarship given how cursory, at best, his research on this seems to be. 

Finally, and this goes way back, your old article ""William Mahone, the Lost Cause, and Civil War History"" got on my radar way back due to its touching on that topic near and dear to me, dueling, but I also blame you and James T. Moore for garnering an enduring interest in the Readjusters in Virginia. An historical counterfactual that has always been a bee in my bonnet since is whether or not the Readjusters could have stayed in power and kept the Redeemers at bay, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Was the Danville Riots merely the straw that quickened their inevitable loss of power, or would they have been able to better solidify their hold and prevent the turn to apartheid if they had won the 1883 state elections?

Related... I know you've written in the past on your blog that a book-length treatment of Mahone is not on the horizon, and assuming my abject begging won't make you reconsider, do you happen to have any recommendations on recent scholarship to look into at least?"

Do you think earlier presidents were less constrained after leaving office in terms of what they felt they could do without lessening their gravitas, etc?

"That's a good point. Any depression in the building trades (as happened when large construction projects basically ceased from the late sixth century onward) was likely to result in a real loss of practical knowledge. The contracting firms who specialized in large projects involving concrete probably vanished during the chaos of the seventh century, leaving only the lime masonry techniques that had always been a basis of residential construction."
"The romanticized image of the lone rider galloping away on a desperate quest isn't wrong, just *mostly* wrong. A knight left an inn on a different horse than he arrived on, sure...but who ever said he left alone?

Late medieval and early modern travelers who rented horses typically didn't just rent a horse. They also hired the services of a ""guide"" who would make sure they ""didn't get lost"" on the way to their next stop. Whether or not the traveler actually needed a guide. Their primary job, as you've probably gathered, was to bring the horse back to their employer.

In a lot of cases, even, the guide wouldn't be on a horse of their own. Several scholars have noted that journey speed was about the same for mounted travelers and travelers on foot. One of the main reasons there is that the enhorsed person was very likely riding next to someone walking. 

By the late 1500s in England, at least, it was finally standard for the guide to also be on horseback.Some places, my impression is particularly in Italy, it was more usual to find, by which I mean pay, someone at your destination willing to take ride the horse to its original inn.

As to the prospects of horse theft, especially if the guide is on foot...hiring a horse was NOT. CHEAP. Yes, it would be more, shall we say, *financially expedient* to steal a horse than to buy one. But in general, you'd have far better and less conspicuous ways of stealing horses than to ride away with one that was pretty well known, especially if you were also somewhat well known. (Of course, lords could also often get away with almost anything they wanted, but that's beyond the scope of the present question.)

You can see, too, how postal systems gradually evolved out of this type of setup. The ruler (or in Europe, the pope was an early adopter) would pay particular inns or stablemasters to always have horses ready for official messengers, who would work out ways to balance horses with the ""postmasters"" at the next stages. (Probably something similar to the standard practice, although these situations are examples of when mounted travelers can go MUCH faster than people on foot). With frequent enough message traffic, it was cheaper for non-urgent/secret letters to be carried by...well, mail deliverers, who knew the route from their stable to the next stops very, very well.

"I certainly don’t know all of them, but the main mechanisms I’m aware of are organized through the National Complaints and Proposals Administration (NCPA). If you google 国家信访局 you can find the government’s official website. 

The NCPA and it’s provincial-level bureaus operate (or at least used to operate) offices across the country for people to submit grievances. Now that much of the population is online, there are digital complaint-reporting forms. 

Similarly, in cracking down on graft and other forms of corruption, avenues (online and offline) were created for people to report state and CCP officials for taking bribes and other things.

Another form of soliciting feedback happens when new policies are being formulated. Depending on what it is, the state and CCP bring together various stakeholders, including prominent academics and entrepreneurs, to discuss ideas, set agendas, or propose possible revisions. In some cases, I believe the Chinese government also opens proposals to a period of public comment.

The CCP also practices “intra-Party democracy,” but that is a little different and may be fading away under Xi Jinping’s leadership.

Now none of this is to say the CCP is always receptive to complaints or dissenting opinions. All of these and probably other mechanisms exist but whether the ideas of the people are given real consideration probably depend on a lot of factors. The central government is typically more receptive of complaints about local governance issues and distinctly unreceptive to any ideas that it feels undermine the CCP’s authority. 

There is also the issue of backlash that could prevent people from submitting complaints. In theory, though I don’t know or any specific cases, a complaint made about a local official could be used against the complaint filer at some point in the future. However, it’s my perception that Chinese people do make use of the mechanisms to complain about issues affecting their daily lives. At one point I heard (anecdotally) that grievance offices in many locations closed, and a lot of people travelled to Beijing just to submit a complaint. 

On closing thought on this: In the past—during the 1950s—the CCP cracked down on critics after Mao Zedong solicited feedback on the CCP’s governance policies. The most prominent case of this was during the Hundred Flowers campaign and the resulting Anti-Rightist campaign. Some critics were jailed and eventually executed, including a decade later during the cultural revolution.

"**Part 2 - Where I Try to Answer the Question**

How people joined trebuchet crews depended on the exact situation, but for people in the design team they would be contacted or be answering a specific request for people to work as siege engineers or carpenters to build the more complex equipment. The carpenters would normally be craftsmen from local towns. Records are quite patchy, but we know that in England the king would ask the Tower of London or another of his castles for military equipment (not just siege equipment, but also more basic things like suits of armour, swords, crossbows, guns etc.) and give them a budget. These castles had a quartermaster with a fancy title who would keep the castle’s equipment well stocked and arrange manufacture and transport for their lord. The Keeper of the Tower of London - the fancy title for the king's quartermaster in London - would then contract local craftsmen to make this equipment. For niche items, like if they didn't want a whole trebuchet but just a spare pulley system for one, then they'd talk to individual carpenters who are named in the financial records of the Royal Wardrobe. For bulk orders and larger jobs, they'd talk to the master of the local guild and pay them a lump sum to fulfil the order. Usually, they'd be asked to follow a design provided for them by the king's own siege engineers, but sometimes they'd get an order along the lines of 'Build a trebuchet that can fire 50lb of stone 400m' or something like that - these were specialist jobs for an ongoing or upcoming siege where something non-standard was needed or anticipated, and building something in the field was impractical.

The field team was a bit more complicated. Soldiers in an army were carefully recorded so that they could be paid properly, which included their rank and job title. We have records of people listed as ""Archer/Trumpeter"" and ""Mounted Crossbowman"", but ""Trebuchet Crew"" does not appear to have been a formal position in the army of later medieval England, a situation which seems to have existed in France as well to my knowledge. Records for crewmen at all are very fragmentary. Some were soldiers told to help out the carpenters, such as a guy named Reginald ""the Janitor"", tasked with guarding and assisting a trebuchet in 1304. Sitting around looking after siege equipment was apparently something he did routinely enough to warrant a nickname. The best answer I can give, and it's an educated guess rather than an authoritative statement, is that trebuchet crews were mostly volunteers or conscripts drawn from the army and camp labourers, operating under the supervision of the more skilled craftsmen and engineers.

But another important part of a trebuchet crew, especially those working with unique or specialised designs, was the guys who aimed it and designed it. The larger counterweight trebuchets were very slow to fire. They also hurled large stones that could weigh over 100kg, which could not be retrieved and refired during an intense siege. When they did hit their target, the picture given in our sources is that most fortifications would collapse after just one or two impacts. Those shots had to count, which means they had to hit almost every time. Larger trebuchets like Richard I’s at the Siege of Acre or Edward I’s at the Siege of Stirling Castle aren’t recorded as taking rangefinding shots, they hit first time. They didn’t have the mathematical knowledge to accurately calculate ballistic trajectories, but they could design the trebuchet to release the shot at a certain angle along a predictable parabolic arc. This would still have required some maths; working out the ratio of the counterweight to the shot being fired, and then what length of sling to use whilst keeping in mind the maximum load the machine can take etc. and these senior engineers could have been either trained as apprentices or perhaps hired as university graduates - some places taught that kind of maths in the later Middle Ages as higher education became less tied to religious institutions. 

As to the designers, the stresses that the wood would have been under are immense, and the pulley systems used to raise the counterweight on the larger machines are complicated. And these things were held together with nails and rope. We know very little about what sort of background and training these higher ranking siege engineers possessed. They weren't formally part of the army, but were retained in the households of dukes and kings as engineers. In peacetime they’d design and supervise construction projects like castles, in wartime they’d command artillery. 

The carpenters would almost certainly be trained through apprenticeships. Sometimes this was a family thing, but not necessarily. People constantly moved from the countryside to cities in search of jobs as apprentices. Before being allowed near something as complicated as a trebuchet, you’d have to work your way up from simpler jobs. If you could make a chair, you could eventually make a trebuchet pulley system. This was just the basic progression within a guild from an apprentice to a master craftsman. This also goes for the components that were not made by carpenters, such as the rope and sling, and the ammunition itself would have been made by masons, usually working with stone from around the area of the siege. 

That being said, the education required for smaller trebuchets was not so great. Smaller artillery pieces like ballistas, catapults, and the small traction trebuchet were simpler. It was possible for someone to pick up this knowledge without much training as there were many books on siege warfare that could teach all the theory and contained designs and instructions to work from. These ranged from Greco-Roman texts like Vitruvius’ De Architectura to contemporary treatises. From there it was simply a matter of practise in the field and basic competency in woodworking. This was indeed the case on the First Crusade, when during the Siege of Nicea (1099) the artillery of the crusaders was partly built by a local engineer hired by Raymond of St Giles - one of the leaders - but also by two unnamed German knights who just happened to know how to make artillery despite having no formalised training.

The main benefit of being a master craftsman working with artillery was that the pay was excellent relative to normal work. Military equipment almost always came at a premium. There aren't many trebuchets for which we have financial records, but one such machine is the War Wolf. The War Wolf was the largest trebuchet ever built, constructed by Edward I for the 1304 Siege of Stirling Castle. The castle had surrendered whilst it was being assembled, but Edward ordered it to be fired once just as a demonstration of his power. That shot levelled a section of the outer wall. It took 5 master craftsmen and another 40ish labourers 3 months to design and build, and its parts filled 30 wagons. It cost in the region of £50. We have the initial budget of £40 paid to the queen's valet, along with a patchy part of the financial records which include later payments to one of the crew (Reginald) and some of the carpenters to partially compensate them for building materials. The labourers would have been paid a low rate of a few pennies per day (though that might be on top of whatever their usual job in the army was), but this means that even accounting for materials, the master craftsmen were walking off with several pounds of silver each for 3 months of work. Based on other records from the Royal Wardrobe for more usual work, that's over a year's wages. Even if materials were really expensive and compensation was minimal, they were still making a lot of money. The War Wolf was a very specialised and difficult job, and the initial £40 budget reflects that, but more routine work manufacturing trebuchet components could be lucrative. The budgets given for artillery in English financial records are always high. 

A more unusual benefit of being a siege engineer in the later Middle Ages was political advancement. As I've mentioned, most siege engineers in the historical record were hired by counts, dukes, and kings on either a seasonal or full time basis. This story is about cannons rather than trebuchets, but the principle holds the same because it’s about guilds rather than the product. During the Hundred Years War, England realised it was behind the French in the development of cannons, so they contracted William Wodeward, the master of London’s foundry, to design and manufacture firearms for the crown. This deal brought him wealth (he was paid over £1500 in the 1380s) but also a seat on London’s city council, as his relationship with the crown meant his guild met the criteria to get council representation. The carpenter’s guild, which did make trebuchets, was one of London’s most important guilds and it is possible that they underwent a similar increase in prominence once the Keeper of the Tower of London started paying them for trebuchet parts. Being seen as a reliable supplier of an important part of the war machine could bring political connections, more business, and a comfortable life. One can also assume that messing it up would be bad for business and power.

"How's this for an answer: some likely did, but others likely didn't.

One caveat: I'm coming at this from a slightly different angle, which is familiarity with the history of sleep research rather than that of the eras you're asking about - so it's one reason I'm hopeful some of the medievalists and early modernists here chime in as I'm quite curious what (if any) debate there's been on this in their fields.

That said, the main contributor to noctural biphasic theory (versus biphasic in general, which can refer to daytime siestas as well) is a historian at Virginia Tech by the name of Roger Ekrich, who back in 2004 wrote a survey of nocturnal habits throughout the world, *At Day's Close - Night in Times Past*.  While much of the book dealt with various societal oddities throughout Europe at night, the one that caught the most traction was his analysis of literature that suggested that pre-industrial age humans slept somewhat differently than we do today:

>Until the close of the early modern era, Western Europeans on most evenings experienced two major intervals of sleep bridged by up to an hour or more of quiet wakefulness. In the absence of fuller descriptions, fragments in several languages in sources ranging from depositions and diaries to imaginative literature give clues to the essential features of this puzzling pattern of repose. The initial interval of slumber was usually referred to as “first sleep,” or, less often, “first nap” or “dead sleep.” In French, the term was premier sommeil or premier somme, in Italian, primo sonno or primo sono, and in Latin, primo somno or concubia nocte. The succeeding interval of sleep was called “second” or “morning” sleep, whereas the intervening period of wakefulness bore no name, other than the generic term “watch” or “watching.” Alternatively, two texts refer to the time of  of “first waking.”

>Both phases of sleep lasted roughly the same length of time, with individuals waking sometime after midnight before returning to rest. Not everyone, of course, slept according to the same timetable. The later at night that persons went to bed, the later they stirred after their initial sleep; or, if they retired past midnight, they might not awaken at all until dawn. Thus in “The Squire’s Tale” in The Canterbury Tales, Canacee slept “soon after evening fell” and subsequently awakened in the early morning following “her first sleep”; in turn, her companions, staying up much later, “lay asleep till it was fully prime” (daylight). William Baldwin’s satire Beware the Cat recounts a quarrel between the protagonist, “newly come unto bed,” and two roommates who “had already slept” their “first sleep.”

>Men and women referred to both intervals as if the prospect of awakening in the middle of the night was common knowledge that required no elaboration....

Ekrich goes on to review a reasonable amount of contemporary literature that suggested this was fairly commonplace and to note a series of early 1990 [experiments by Thomas Wehr at the NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10607034) that artificial light appeared to be one of the primary culprits responsible for disturbing biphasic sleep, along with a walk through what people actually used to do in the middle of the night.

So far, so good, and Ekrich continued this research across cultures and [published](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-history/faculty/a-roger-ekirch.html) in several fairly well respected journals, lectured in front of medical faculties, and even is on the board of the main publication of the National Sleep Foundation.

Except then in the early 2010s, his theory took a bit of a hit. Several anthropologists got interested in the subject, and realized that their field provided a fantastic opportunity to check on this with current day isolated preindustrial societies.  The result was a 2015 paper, [*Natural sleep and its seasonal variations in three societies*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4720388/), that went a step further and put Actiwatches on current day pre-industrial societies near the equator - and noted precisely none of them experienced biphasic sleep.

[Ekrich's response](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4763365/#B4) is quite interesting, and in a sign of the importance his theories had gained it appeared in what's considered the main sleep research journal, *Sleep*.  But the relevant part for your question is this portion:

>As I have recently written at length, consolidated sleep to which the industrialized world aspires, if not always successfully—due perhaps to the persistence of this once dominant pattern—is for Western societies a remarkably youthful form of sleep, a product not of the primeval past but of forces grounded in technology (artificial illumination) and shifting cultural attitudes toward sleep over the course of the Industrial Revolution. ***This is not to argue that segmented sleep has been the predominant pattern of sleep among all preindustrial peoples in the non-Western world.*** [emphasis added]

So, the best answer is probably that it depends on the population and possibly where they're located, along with how much artificial light they were exposed to.

Edit: And thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"
"That's an apt comparison. 

At Agincourt - maybe the second largest battle of the Hundred Years' War and one that took place shortly after Zheng He's fourth expedition returned to Nanjing - there was a combined 18,000 - 40,000 combatants. The numerically superior French force had no more than 30,000 and was nonetheless one of the largest armies fielded in Western Europe during the medieval period. Zheng He's marine force was sufficiently large enough to threaten conquest of any entity they encountered as far west as the frontier of the Timurid empire.

It's really only in the context of major eastern empires that the expeditionary force might be considered small. For example, during the civil war in which the Yongle Emperor took power the largest armies numbered up to 500,000 men. Later he led 100,000 men north in a campaign to subjugate the Mongol tribes. This shows that Zheng He's army was not intended as an invasion force, and in all likelihood would've struggled to carry out a prolonged campaign against any substantial enemy due to logistical reasons. However, it carried the threat of conquest for smaller states and was therefore sufficient to intimidate them into paying tribute."

">This speculation on the spice price could be very lucrative, as the prices fluctuated strongly as the arrival date of the ships was basically random.

Do you have a source for the comment that the arrival date of the ships was ""random?""  My impression was that by the 17th century, global weather patterns affecting the VOC routes (Europe->South Africa->Indonesia, roughly - the Cape Route /  Brouwer Route ) were well known and caused a seasonal variation to sailing dates, in order to catch the most favourable wind patterns around the world.   Bruijn (1980), references two fleets of ships departing Amsterdam each year around April or May (the Easter Fleet) and around Christmas.  These fleets would stay together and return to Amsterdam around 18 months later.

You're mainly concerned with the return; on that subject Bruijn  writes:

>Company management sought a degree of certainty over the time when they could expect ships from the orient; the period between April and October they considered to be the most favorable.  Ships were then safely in Holland before the storms of the autumn, and by the same token, the auctions could be held before winter.  Buyers would then have time to transship their goods before the onset of freezing weather.  Therefore, the authorities in Batavia were expected to arrange matters that the return fleet could depart in November, and certainly no later than 15 December.

This doesn't change the point of your comment, in that warehousing and the related speculation could be very lucrative, since the fleets were arriving in a certain time of year and presumably the demand was year-round.  And these arrivals in any given year could delayed by weather, shipwrecks, or security issues, which would drive up commodity prices if the fleet were late.

Edit:  It is also noted that although ships might depart Batavia at various times, a convoy system required westbound ships from the East Indies to wait at ""the Cape"" (Cape Town, South Africa), and travel the rest of the way to Europe together, mainly for security reasons such as evading threats from other European powers.  Details of this depends on the exact time being considered, but it underscores that arrivals in Amsterdam of many ships together is not ""random"" but actually specifically as prescribed.

"The book of Enoch seems to fit well with the apocalyptic and dualistic trends in Israelite religion of the day, but I’m not sufficiently versed in Enoch to give any kind of useful answer here.

As for Jesus’ existence, I simply see enough evidence that he probably lived.  We’ve got numerous writers attesting to the existence of a Christian community not long after when Jesus is said to have lived.  While the miracles might be controversial, it’s not a stretch at all to believe that there was an itinerant preacher in that period who had followers."

"I want to know how the peasant class felt about the process of industrialization. It would seem that the older, medieval ""logic"" was not only abandoned, but forgotten.

This transition period and all of its cultural and economic attachments fascinates me. Even the nature of time seemed to change from something cyclical to linear and fragmented, but I'm curious how this came about psych- and sociologically. How does one transition into atomization? Is the shifting mode of production rapid, acutely felt; and are the cultural changes experienced byproducts of a faceless change in the forces/means/mode of production, or was there a fair amount of perceived human agency?

"Mussolini was certainly an avid reader, albeit by no means an accomplished scholar, nor was he the *Homo Novus* of Fascism, blessed with the philosophical depth of Vico, the intellectual prowess of Machiavelli, the moral strength of Mazzini and the literary genius of Dante - and, of course, Garibaldi's charisma and Caesar's martial disposition. 

During the 1930s - the period when the external manifestations of the Regime became more ""manifest"", and also the period when the attitude of the Western Powers towards Fascist Italy begun to sour - Mussolini's public persona begun to increase the weight of certain ideal traits that the Regime wished to promote within the Italian population: frugality, connection with the land and with manual labor, moral integrity as a consequence of honest work rather than intellectual abstractions. This resulted in many well known images of Mussolini doing ""people things"": harvesting, bricklaying, etc. It also coincided with a very noticeable shift in Mussolini's self-representation. Looking at his early biographies, one finds various references to his education and intellectual disposition - and even a few to possible ""noble ancestors"" - but later on, Mussolini himself insisted that his parents and ancestors had all been laborers and peasants, and rather poor ones at that; pointing out for instance that his parents worked hard so the they had ""meat for the soup on Sundays"". 


Concretely speaking, Mussolini was a passably educated man for the standards of his time - especially within the political sphere. He was sufficently well read for his professional necessities as a publicist and, indeed, his professional and occupational needs remained one of the main motives behind his intellectual interests.

Mussolini had studied French in his youth - an important part of any passable education at the time - and kept some of it, as knowledge of a second language was useful for a school teacher. He had also learnded a bit of Latin and German. He further improved the latter during his Swiss stay, when apparently he produced some translations. 

That said, Mussolini had a habit of affecting a linguistic proficiency he didn't really have - as Hitler's interpreter could testify to - so that I am not sure how good those translations might have been. He could read it though.


As to his readings, since his very early twenties (and with the exception of a brief interlude back at his teacher's duty - possibly due to familiar reasons) Mussolini's main occupation had been his agit-prop and public speaker activity and later, almost as an extension of the previous one, that of publicist. 

All these things had one trait in common: read a lot, summarize the main ideas, be prepared to argue about those, skip the things which don't matter. Which, obviously, doesn't make for an organic and coherent formulation of large sprawling intellectual architectures, but was an apt and viable method for Mussolini's practical needs, as well as in line with the general trends of the time, where vulgarization and ""advertisement"" were becoming a larger and larger portion of the ""business"" of ideas. 

This sort of heuristic approach was certainly not exclusive to Mussolini. Other figures of undisputed intellectual influence - the name of Georges Sorel comes to mind - weren't substantially more well lerned. Of course, unlike those others, at a certain point Mussolini's political career begun to take prominence over his other occupations, so that his intellectual aspirations had to adapt and accommodate for the former, becoming at the same time more heuristic and more manufactured. 

Outside of that political career - which is the source of our present interest in Mussolini's intellectual trajectory - he might have been remembered as a mediocre intellectual and proficient publicist, with some following, not much differently from the way Sorel was thought of during his last years.

"Perpetua and Felicitas are found commemorated on the calendar of 354AD.

More importantly, a Latin-speaking Christian named Tertullian mentions the text and the martyrdom of the two women in his treatise On the Soul (De Anima), which was probably written before 210AD.

&#x200B;

See esp. Heffernan, Thomas J. *The Passion of Perpetua and Felicity* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), 60-78.

Edit: It should also be noted that the *Martyrdom of Perpetua and Felicitas* is more likely a very early third century document. Both Heffernan and - if I correctly recall - Sara Parvis suggest around 203AD."
"Benjamin of Tudela wrote in Hebrew, and I could not for the life of me tell you definitely what the original measurement used is (Roman *mil*?) or whether the ""mile"" mentioned here is converted to today's Imperial standard. The translator's notes very helpfully define for us what Benjamin means by ""parasang"" and ""day's journey,"" but not what is translated ""mile""!

Benjamin writes that Kus is ""300 miles"" to Fayoum, and according to the editor Kus is halfway between Qena and Luxor. That gives a distance of ~330 modern miles according to Google maps, which seems close enough to the modern unit for someone measuring distance by guesstimate (since he writes elsewhere about being able to see ""100 miles"" from a vantage spot, and so forth).

As for kilometers--this translation was published in England in 1907, so--nope, definitely not going to be converting to km for publication."
"Enjoyed the throughness and capacity of your very well-written answer, bravo!"
"To add to what u/PartyMoses has said, the debate among historians of leisure is very similar to parallel debates within cultural and social history about many other concepts or terms: namely, before we had a concept like ""leisure"", was there something empirically real in the lives of human beings that we could call ""leisure""? 

There's a well-known debate in the field of leisure history between Peter Burke (no relation) and JL Marfany that illuminates this question--Burke's original essay ""The Invention of Leisure in Early Modern Europe"" in the journal Past and Present in 1995 and Marfany's rejoinder in the same journal in 1997 (followed by an additional response to the response by Burke). 

Burke argues that while late medieval serfs may have not been constantly engaged in labor, they did not conceptualize the time they were not working in terms of what we think of as leisure. Leisure, Burke argues, is specifically defined as time off from work within the regimentation of time that characterized industrial societies between the late 18th and late 20th Century. All the things that we associate with leisure--hobbies, private time with family and friends in domestic settings, organized social occasions like drinking in pubs or watching sports, the consumption of culture (reading, watching TV, going to the opera, etc.)--in Burke's view only really exist as a distinct form of sociocultural experience in modernity and are only defined as the opposite or alternative to work in industrial regimes.

Burke observes that late medieval European peasants did generally engage in distinctive kinds of cultural or social activities during ""not-work"" and didn't divide or imagine their days in those terms. The only thing, in his view, that seems somewhat like leisure are festivals or fairs and these, he notes, were mostly associated with holy days on the Christian calendar and with religious observation--that they might have contests or spectacles built into them was a sort of sideline. Burke also points out that the origins of leisure were very distinctly associated at first with the aristocracy or ""gentlemanly"" classes, who in the early modern period increasingly found themselves with less and less to do and yet in some cases with more and more resources available to do as they pleased--and that this is the era in which many new forms of ""leisure-like"" activities started to emerge. Industrialization allowed the concept to spread to new middle-classes and eventually workers--but leisure was also something they had to fight for. 

Marfany replies: come on, late medieval peasants drank with friends, they had boisterous conversations with their families and neighbors, they took breaks from agricultural work and just lazed about, they went swimming or daydreamed--and all of this was ""leisure"" even if it wasn't conceptualized as such by them and it wasn't as tightly organized or as various in its forms as in the modern period. In essence, Marfany says, ""the concept might be new, but it is giving a name to something much more universal"". 

Since the 1990s, you can find echoes of this debate all up and down the historiography of leisure. Were Roman gladiatorial matches ""leisure"" of the same kind as our modern football matches? It looks like it at first--but some historians who study gladiatorial matches argue that they were more akin to religious ceremonies or had other purposes in the minds of the participants and spectators than what we would think of as leisure. And yet other historians reply as Marfany does: if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck: people seem to have gone to the matches for fun, they certainly weren't at work, there's nothing that precludes a fun, leisurely activity from having additional political, spiritual or cultural meanings. 

You might think the way out of this is simply to ask, as the OP does, how much time people spent working and then figure that the remainder is all leisure. The less time working, the more leisure, certainly? And yet I think we today recognize first that in our current economy (all the more so in covid-19), distinguishing work from not-work can be remarkably difficult. Am I working in answering this? I am an employed historian who believes professors have some form of public responsibility. But I'm not at all required to do it--no one in my workplace knows that I do. I can disappear for months at a time from r/AskHistorians and no one sends an email to my employer. So I must be doing it for fun as a kind of not-work. Which is also true but...not really the same kind of not-work as when I'm out on a walk or working on my photography. 

It isn't necessarily easy to separate work and not-work in pre-industrial societies either. In the region of southern Africa that I know best, there's a harvest ritual that involves threshing grain like sorghum or millet--it's 'fun' in the sense that people get to recite amusingly insulting songs and poems about each other, there's some drinking involved--but it's also labor. Marshall Sahlins has famously suggested in his essay on ""Stone Age economics"" that pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherers had the most leisure time and the least work time of any human society, and he certainly has a point--agriculture makes extreme demands on human labor, especially seasonally. But again take a confusing bit of evidence, since we don't have much direct observational knowledge of their lives--were cave paintings ""fun"" or were they ""work""--a practical exercise intended to give spiritual aid and encouragement to hunters? 

I think it's reasonable to say that modern life between about 1800 and 1990 was the most regimented in terms of time in human history, and the boundaries between work and not-work were the most formally defined and enforced. And as such, they were also something that employers and rulers could restrict or constrain, and in some ways, human beings both had more to do when they were not working and yet less time to do it in. We may be in an era when the boundaries of work and not-work are breaking down again, but that is seemingly not returning time back to people--thought that is a debate outside the bounds of r/AsHistorians."

Sorry I am coming to this so late, but shout-outs to /u/FinrodIngoldo and /u/Assorted_Bits for linking me and to my previous answer on Martin Van Buren's accent. I have also written [this response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6nl9np/when_britain_conquered_new_amsterdam_what_did_the/dkaf6lq/) previously which discusses the history of the Dutch community after the English takeover, which may also be relevant to this question.

I'll start with a short-ish answer, and then give more details about it in a long answer.

**SHORT-ISH ANSWER**: 

> How long did these Dutch-speaking settlements survive

By the first decade of the 1700s, the Dutch language was being used by less than a majority of New Yorkers. By the beginning of the American Revolution, use had fallen to below a third, if that. The war split these communities and they rapidly diminished. English was perceived as the ""American"" language. Dutch was increasingly perceived as a bygone, rustic language of uneducated people. As early as 1790, only about 17.5% of New Yorkers were part of the Dutch community, just about half of what the community had been less than two decades earlier. You can probably point to 1835 as the date when the last ""Dutch-speaking settlement"" finally gave way, as the last year when any of the Dutch churches was giving a sermon in Dutch. There was a small, but dwindling, group of Americans in New York and New Jersey who still spoke Dutch after that, though few spoke it as their primary language. By 1910, the number of people who were conversant at all was only around 200, and they were almost all seventy years old or older, most living in northern New Jersey. The last person known to have been in any way conversant was James Storms, born in New Jersey in 1860, and died in 1949. At the time of his death, though, he figured he was ""*about* the last"" speaker - but nobody known to be a native speaker of the dialect has been found to have died later than him.

> how did the Anglo government of New York manage administering them?

For many decades after the English takeover in 1664, there was severe resistance among the New York Dutch community, sometimes turning violent. Leisler's Rebellion in 1690 marked the final time the Dutch ever controlled New York. Up until the 1730s, New York politics was organized around two political proto-parties called the ""Leislerians"" and ""Anti-Leislerians"" with the Dutch predominantly belonging to the Leislerian party. However, by the end of the 1730s, politics had begun to re-organize along different lines, and the Dutch community as a united political faction never existed again. By the middle of the 1700s, the Dutch Church leaders were lamenting the fact that so few of the younger generation were conversant in the language that it threatened to die off - and the church along with it. There was a protracted debate within the church about whether to Anglicize or not. In any case, by the mid-1700s, the Anglo government had little worry—culturally, anyway—over administering this community. The Dutch were almost universally bilingual, and the community itself was divided over the language issue, which in itself represented a cultural shift. While individual politicians in Dutch strongholds probably did benefit from knowing the language and otherwise appealing to the community long after that, within the first two or three decades of the 1800s, the communities were so mixed in the former ""Dutch towns"" of Long Island, the Hudson River Valley, and New Jersey, that there really wouldn't have been much added benefit in making such appeals. Dutch people largely wanted to be ""Americans"", not ""Dutch"" outsiders, so such appeals may very well have backfired. A more simple appeal to patriotism, and to whatever the political issues of the day were, would have been enough to attract the bilingual Dutch community of the 19th century.

**LONG ANSWER**: 

First, to briefly update that Martin Van Buren answer linked at the top:

1. I did receive my copy of *An Epoch and a Man: Martin Van Buren and His Times* by Denis Tilden Lynch, and unfortunately, it did not give any source or any further path to follow on the claim that Van Buren had a Dutch accent. So the trail seems to dead-end there, at least for now. I have read most, if not all, of the major biographies on Van Buren and the more recent-ish ones seem to back off the claim, including those by Donald B. Cole, John Niven, and Ted Widmer. Widmer's does note that Van Buren ""grew up speaking Dutch"" in a ""polyglot"" American society, and that he ""would seem a little foreign all his life"", but does not repeat the ""Dutch accent"" claim that may have originated with Lynch.

2. In that answer, I compared Dutch speakers in New York state to modern day Spanish speakers in the Bronx. I neglected to draw a perhaps more obvious parallel in French-speaking Canada. In that community, French speakers often do have a discernibly unique accent when speaking English (examples [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yYPD6JJtDM) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pURUo3yTiy4)), which sometimes can be rather pronounced (example [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlvzMlMZLE)). The wider Dutch New York community may have expressed a similar trait. However, I stand by what I wrote about Van Buren for the reasons I gave there: Van Buren grew up post-Revolution not pre-Revolution, there was already a trend away from the Dutch language for decades before Van Buren was born, and the circumstances of his father's business would have emphasized and exposed him to more bilingualism than the average Dutch person of the time. On top of that, it still would have been an American accent—certainly a Dutch-American accent—and not a ""Dutch accent"", just as a French Canadian has a Canadian accent when speaking English, not a French one. It's French-Canadian, but it's still Canadian.

   Further, Quebec is not a perfect example, either, because much of the province is far more isolated than the Dutch New York community ever was. Most of the ""Dutch towns"" in Long Island and in the Hudson River Valley weren't much more than 50% Dutch-speaking, if that, and were almost always adjacent to an ""English town"" just a few miles down the road or river. There was a lot more exposure to the English language there after 1700 than there was in Quebec, where the British government deliberately avoided settling English speakers after 1783, so French-speaking Canada remained much more insular.

But none of that answers /u/ZnSaucier's question directly, which I will try to do. Much of the below is taken from the book *Cookies, Coleslaw, and Stoops: The Influence of Dutch on the North American Languages* by Nicoline van der Sijs. The first chapter (""The Dutch Language in North America"") runs over 100 pages and discusses at length the fate of North American Dutch, including its last speakers. I'll mention other sources as I go.

As explained in the second of my two previous answers linked at the top, the English took over the New Netherland colony (i.e., New York state - New Amsterdam was its major settlement in southern Manhattan) in 1664. The English government tried to anglicize the Dutch community from the get-go but there was major resistance to this, particularly among the Dutch farming class, but also among the Dutch elite. In 1668, Jeremias van Rensselaer, one of the richest people in the colony, [wrote to relatives](https://books.google.com/books?id=-P2GDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA130) back in the Netherlands:

> ""Now it seems that it has pleased the Lord [to ordain] that we must learn English. The worst of it all is that we have already for nearly four years been under this jurisdiction and that as yet I have learned so little. The reason is that one has no liking for it.""

In 1673-74, the Dutch briefly retook control of the colony, but the English regained it in the treaty that ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Then, in 1689-90, there was a revolt in the colony itself known as Leisler's Rebellion, manned by Dutch partisans, which was able to take control of the government for nine months. This was led by Jacob Leisler who was ""High Dutch"" (now German) by birth, but identified with the New York Dutch community. The English navy eventually showed up and put the revolt down. This was the last time the Dutch really ever had control of New York.

However, for almost another half century, the Dutch community remained a major force in New York politics. As explained by Michael G. Kammen in his book *Colonial New York: A History*, at least until the late 1730s, New York partisans were organized around two informal factions known as the ""Leislerians"" and the ""Anti-Leislerians"". The Leislerians were dominated by pro-Dutch, anti-English, sometimes pro-separatist, politicians. Typically, this meant New Yorkers of the Dutch community. 

But by the end of the 1730s, and certainly by the time of the French and Indian War, these factions began to break down. Kammen quotes New York politician Philip Livingston in 1737, who wrote:

> ""We change sides as serves our interest best, not ye countries.""

Instead of Leislerians and anti-Leislerians, the two new factions came to be known as the Livingstons and the Delanceys, after the two prominent, elite families who contributed several leaders on the two competing sides over multiple generations. The Livingstons were more aligned with the British Whigs, and mostly became Patriots during the American Revolution, while the Delanceys aligned with the British Tories and mostly became Loyalists during the war. Oliver Delancey himself would lead a Loyalist military regiment throughout the war.

"That would make for some fantastic reading. To the best of my knowledge, however, we have no record of what the real fathers thought about their sons' claims. (Usually, it seems, men had the decency to wait until their fathers were dead before playing the divine paternity card.)"
"  Hi Qwert123321Z, hopefully this answer will pass moderation, I have answered questions on the IRA previously and am well situated to answer this one, having a Masters degree in Modern History, my final dissertation was based on interviews with IRA members both in rural and metropolitan areas of Northern Ireland. The focus of the piece was the motivations of the members I interviewed as well as details of the military actions the individuals conducted during their membership. I can’t exactly quote members as this would breach the agreement I had at the time of the interviews, although I’m happy to discuss something with Mods if need be. I’ve drafted up this answer between tasks at work so hopefully it isn’t too disjointed.

The main reference points for my answer are:

· Tim Pat Coogan – The IRA

· Eamon McGuire – Enemy of the Empire

· Toby Harnden – Bandit Country

· Information from interviews with IRA members conducted in early 2000’s

The question you’ve posed has a simple answer and a complex answer. The simple answer is that there was no set method of entry into the IRA, although the IRA did in fact have a ‘manual’ (I should point out here that the manual had several versions over the years of operation) that outlined their political and military goals and it was expected that IRA ‘Volunteers’ (the IRA refers to its’ members using this term) would read this document and fully adhere to the principals therein. 

You can find a copy of one version of the Green Book at the back of Tim Pat Coogans book entitled ‘The I.R.A’, via google search on the CAIN website and some copies of Ten Men Dead’ by David Beresford have it at the back of the book (I was told by an IRA member in Belfast that the material used by the author was given to him by the IRA as the author had agreed to place a copy of the green book in the publication as the IRA was having difficulty making their own copies as well as the fact that ownership of the document could result in arrest). Regarding the use of the term Provisional IRA – the PIRA as we know did not consider themselves ‘Provisional’ instead they called themselves the IRA, so as not to appear different from the real article, so to speak. If you are ever in an area sympathetic to the IRA you may hear references to stickies (the ‘Official’ IRA) and ‘Pinnies’ for the Provisional IRA – supposedly due to preferences in attaching Easter Lilies during Easter Week.

The full/compiled recruitment method of the IRA, according to most of what you read in the various texts on the subject (I’ll recommend reading at the end) is something like this:

1. Prospective recruit is either approached or approaches IRA contact

2. Recruit is vetted to confirm who they are

3. Recruit is asked to read Green Book

4. Recruit is quizzed on their understanding of the text with the most important questions being around their understanding what membership in the IRA meant: the outcomes are victory, imprisonment or death

5. Recruit is inducted via an Oath, something along the lines of swearing to uphold the values of the Irish Republic and to obey the orders of the IRA Army Council

6. The oath would supposedly be administered whilst placing a hand on a revolver and a symbol of the Catholic faith.

The above is the abridged, compiled version. In reality it could be very different. Although knowing who a recruit was would be something that appears consistent with all the accounts I have read (Enemy of the Empire is a good example of this). Simply showing up in a Republican area and asking to speak to the local IRA recruiter would be a hazardous course of action to take when dealing with an organisation that regularly tortured and killed those it suspected of working for the British Government (look up ‘the disappeared’ and Denis Donaldson who was shot to death not that long ago). The members I spoke to differed in how they joined only in the final method of recruitment. Most did already know someone who may or may not have been in the IRA and proceeded to speak with that person, professing a guarded interest in ‘doing more’ as one volunteer put it. After that they would wait to be approached again. Possible recruits would be vetted by asking other, trusted republicans about the recruit’s family and anything else that was known about that person. In reading the Green Book you will note that the IRA did not like anyone who was known to be a heavy drinker.  So, you can take that as one of the other red flags the IRA may have had. 

For someone who was already known to the IRA or if you lived in an area where the IRA was heavily engaged in a prospective member may simply have ended up being a fully fledged member. If you lived in the Bogside (Derry) or on the Falls Road (Belfast) you may have already been engaged in riotous activities and may have (unbeknownst to you) already have been earmarked by the IRA as someone who could be asked to do something more than throw stones. One person I interviewed from Belfast mentioned that he had been part of a local community defence organisation (building barricades and throwing petrol bombs) when a friend of his (who was in the IRA) asked him to help out with ‘a job’. The ‘job’ turned out to be the execution of someone suspected of providing the police with information. The person declined the invitation to take the next step, although he did allow the IRA to use his car to conduct armed patrols and move weapons.

In terms of the famous oath on the gun, only one IRA member said they had undergone this induction and they were based in Belfast. Admittedly this person was one of the very first members to the newly formed PIRA back in the late 60’s. 

After the person has joined the IRA, they may have undergone some training. Depending on the circumstances of the time the recruit may have travelled to a remote area of Ireland (on either side of the border) to conduct some basic paramilitary drills and learn how to operate a firearm. If the recruit was considered smart enough, they would be encouraged to go and study electrical engineering or another similar subject so they could become proficient in bomb making. The IRA also made some training videos, unfortunately the production values in the early videos was poor but does show the intent they had.

I hope this is somewhat helpful to you – there is no set answer to your question unfortunately. Every IRA person I have met and every book I’ve read on the subject has a different answer. I’d happy to answer any further questions you have via PM. 

In terms of further reading, check out the books I reference at the beginning of my answer, perhaps with the addition of:

In terms of the specific 1960s-1980s artists you mention, a lot of the musicians you mention existed ultimately outside of the country music establishment. Johnny Cash is ultimately an enormous country music star, of course, but in a lot of ways he also paved the way for Americana, before that label really existed. He first released music on Sam Phillips' Sun Records, an independent record label that was ultimately most famous for rock & roll and releasing music by Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley amongst others - he was initially seen as something of a rockabilly artist. Sam Phillips' ear wasn't a traditional Nashville country ear - Sun Records was down the road in Memphis, of course - and he fairly correctly discerned that there was something in Cash that would have an appeal beyond the traditional country audience. Cash then signed to the major label Columbia in 1958. 

Ultimately Cash had strong links to country music's traditional origins - he eventually married June Carter, the daughter of Maybelle Carter of the Carter Family, and his live shows would feature June doing Carter Family songs for much of his career. But Cash was a crossover artist with the capacity to appeal to people beyond the world of country music (e.g., he took a live cover of 'A Boy Named Sue' by Shel Silverstein to #2 in the charts); a bit like the Taylor Swift of the 1960s. Cash was also quite interested in the urban folk revival of the early 1960s - politically diametrically opposed to the Nashville establishment, not least because the urban folk revival might include *actual communists* - and recorded versions of the same traditional folk songs done by folkies the Kingston Trio or Joan Baez, along with songs by Bob Dylan (ultimately guesting on a duet with Dylan on his 1969 *Nashville Skyline* record, also released on Columbia Records, where Dylan did his version of country music). Johnny Cash's embrace of folk music in this way was relatively unusual in the world of country music, and did play a role in the development of the idea of 'Americana' (as did Dylan being a folk/rock artist who went in the other direction, along with Gram Parsons' 'Cosmic American Music' with the Byrds on *Sweethearts Of The Rodeo*, and a few others).

Artists like Willie Nelson found niches because of this growing Americana movement. Nelson was a hit songwriter in the country establishment in the early 1960s thanks to Patsy Cline's 1962 hit with his song 'Crazy', but Nelson himself only had middling success as an establishment Nashville artist in the 1960s (one thing which is indicative of the country music establishment vs Americana divide is the string sections and backing vocalists on 1960s Nashville recordings, designed to make the music go down smooth, and which was hated by the Americana types who wanted rawer, more 'authentic' sounds; in 2009, Sony/Legacy released an album called *Naked Willie* which featured 1960s Willie Nelson recordings minus the strings and backing vocals in order to appeal to the Americana market). In the end, Nelson achieved mainstream success after moving away from Nashville to Texas, and signing to Atlantic Records, usually better known as a soul/rock record label (e.g., the record label of Ray Charles in the 1950s, Aretha Franklin in the late 1960s, and then Led Zeppelin in the 1970s). His 1973 Atlantic album *Shotgun Willie* received writeups in the likes of *Rolling Stone* and he received attention outside of the country music world, partly due to Atlantic's marketing and partly due to Nelson's relatively adventurous, jazz/soul-influenced country music fitting in with the emerging market for Americana. When Nelson then signed to Columbia - a record label with some experience marketing Johnny Cash to a mainstream audience - he had big hits like the *Red-Headed Stranger* and *Stardust* albums, and was generally seen as spearheading the 'outlaw country' movement.

The outlaw country movement of the 1970s also featured rebels against the Nashville establishment like Waylon Jennings (once a rock'n'roller playing with Buddy Holly) and Kris Kristofferson (whose late 1960s songwriting got him noticed - and covered both by rock and country artists - and who was fairly progressive on tracks like 'Blame It On The Stones' which satirised the moral panic in conservative circles around long-haired hippies), some of whom were more progressive than the Nashville norm. But it's also fair to say that there were also less...socially progressive elements of outlaw country (David Allan Coe's 1982 *Underground Album*[ is *notorious* for its offensiveness, for example](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/21/offensive-albums-ice-cube-david-allan-coe))! 

Broadly speaking, John Prine and Steve Earle also fit into the same kind of mix-of-folk-and-country milieu that characterises Americana; again, assuming Wikipedia is accurate, Prine was apparently discovered by Kristofferson in a Chicago folk club, and signed to Atlantic Records shortly before Willie Nelson did. Steve Earle was obsessed with Townes Van Zandt as a teenager and as a young adult in the 1970s was playing in Guy Clark's band; both Van Zandt and Guy Clark were associated with both Americana (in that their songwriting had a mix of folk and country) and the outlaw country movement. So both artists broadly speaking fit into the Americana mould that had developed after Johnny Cash, *Sweethearts Of The Rodeo*, *Nashville Skyline*, and so forth - and where they became successful it was because they could ride that Americana pipeline to get noticed outside of the country music world. After all, in the 1970s of the outlaw country movement, the biggest band in America were the Eagles, a California rock band who had a mix of country and folk influences that isn't a million miles from Americana; if a Guy Clark could get known by and appeal to even a tiny fraction of the Eagles' fanbase, they really could sustain a career."

"I find this answer, while maybe not wrong (although on the other hand probably some people would argue yes very wrong), very dated. From the Gracchi to Nero is a good book, and as recently as twenty years ago you'd still have found it on undergraduate reading lists, but it's *really* old, and Scullard was a proponent of the now universally rejected Frozen Waste model. Scullard, for example, believed in a ""Marian"" army, which has more or less fallen out of scholarship, although I don't know of any definitive rejection of it the way Millar is a definitive rejection of the Frozen Waste. There are a few errors in this comment, e.g.:

>the lowest classes were legally forbidden from serving as legionaries

[Untrue. Not only is there no known law forbidden the fifth property class from fighting in the legions, Livy preserves several cases of men who appear to have volunteered in the third or second centuries despite being below the nominal two jugera property qualification. Sallust, Iug., 86 seems to suggest that Marius conscripted the capite censi, not that he allowed them to volunteer. Such practice had clearly already been commonplace a century earlier. Moreover, there's no evidence that whatever Marius did in the Jugurthine War was a permanent fixture of military enrollment. See Brunt, Roman Manpower]

and

>Even an ordinary career offered a chance of a good retirement, with land as a reward

[Untrue. In the period that you're talking about veteran settlements were extremely rare. There's only a handful of them in the second and first centuries, the most prominent being Saturninus' two settlements, Sulla's, Pompey's, Caesar's, and those of the Triumvirs. Of these only Sulla's, Caesar's, and the Triumvirs' settlements appear to have been predominantly or wholly veterans. Every single one of these before Caesar is contested, with the veterans often not being settled for decades. Military colonies were a feature of the fourth and third centuries, but they noticeably disappear during the second. Veteran settlement is a feature of the Principate, not the Republic]

But more importantly you make a number of claims about what soldiers wanted or did not want, and what they thought or did not think, but you don't back it up with any evidence except to say that soldiers could benefit from the army. While it certainly may be logical that soldiers would have wanted warfare because they could benefit from service, and while we do see cases in which this is clearly true (e.g. the army at Nola in 88), we know essentially nothing at all about what soldiers thought. When we *do* know anything it's because of incidents of discontent. I'd be inclined to say that episodes of discontent are rarer by far than episodes of consensus, but they exist, there are many of them, they're very prominent (almost defining, sometimes), and I don't know of anybody who's ever done a catalog of such incidents so I can't definitively say one way or the other. Livy relates a number of incidents, mostly in the second century, of soldiers refusing service or otherwise being sticks in the mud. As one very prominent example, take the episode in Book 42. At 42.32 Livy mentions that when Licinius began conscripting troops many men volunteered, because they had seen that the troops who had fought the Macedonians earlier had returned rich. Ok, so far so good, but the main part of the passage is Livy's account of a mutiny by the centurions. The military tribunes that year had conscripted centurions not based on age and seniority, which would have left many of the most experienced centurions out, but based on who was considered best. Twenty-three centurions mutinied and appealed to the tribunes of the people, including one Sp. Ligustinus, whom Livy says pointed out that he had been a volunteer from below the two jugera qualification when he first enlisted as a soldier--and therefore was as attached to the army as any man--but that he was now past the normal age of conscription and had fathered four sons to replace him.

Similarly, during the vote on the Macedonian War in 200 the assembly--the centuriate assembly, so ideologically the army voting on its own leaders and its own wars--rejected the call for war, which forced the consul to order them to redo the vote. And Rosenstein has argued--and this has become a somewhat grudging consensus since--that so many men were refusing to enroll in the census in order to escape conscription into the Spanish Wars in the second century that it noticeably affected the manpower pool and that *this* is what Gracchus had observed on his way to Numantia, without realizing what he was looking at. There are also the mutinies of Caesar's troops, one of whose grievances was that they were tired of fighting wars, and so forth.

The picture then seems a lot more complicated than the simple ""Roman soldiers benefitted from war, and wanted it."" Rosenstein, who points out that the Republic was at war and actively deploying armies in foreign operations *every year* of the second and first centuries, catalogs a truly horrific casualty rate, and his estimates are on the low end. And Rosenstein finds quite a lot of evidence that this really did matter to families, although he also argues that for many rural families--the *only* kind that fought most of Rome's wars well into the Principate--it was a welcome relief to be able to send away a son for several years, whose mouth now didn't have to be fed and who might come back with plunder, even if he had a fairly good chance (by some estimates well over 50%) of never coming back. A more accurate statement would probably be that *some* wars were very popular, and other wars simply weren't. Armies that were headed for regions thought to be wealthy, such as the Greek east, appear to have attracted more volunteers and soldiers like those at Nola in 88 were very anxious to avoid being replaced (although note again that a Macedonian war was voted down in 200). Similarly, armies that were thought to have good commanders seem to have been more popular. When Marius set out to fight Jugurtha the manpower crisis that he saw was not as a result of casualties, but because not enough men were reporting for conscription because the war was highly unpopular. Marius' appointment as consul to the war seems to have helped turn around the perception of the war's viability (the same thing happened with Pompey a few times), which is one of the reasons why Sallust gives him the famous speech in which he criticizes the people who command Roman armies. But prior to Marius' consulship the war in Africa seems to have been remarkably unpopular. Similarly, Rosenstein finds evidence that the Spanish Wars, which lasted throughout the second century with very little progress, weren't popular at all, such that men even avoided enrollment in the census to dodge conscription."

TL; DR: Unique supply constraints in Vietnam made resupplying troops with fresh uniforms impossible. 

A similar question was asked about several years ago, with a [great answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1m5x69/how_were_uniforms_modified_by_soldiers/) with regard to the British military’s uniform modification given by /u/vonstroheims_monocle. 

In short, as /u/vonstroheims_monocle writes, the weather of any given locale plays a major role in the decision of troops to make modifications to their uniforms. Given Vietnam’s swelteringly hot and humid climate, it makes sense that forward operating infantry would modify their uniforms to make it easier to do their jobs. But this observation doesn’t get precisely at your question, which is why, at least in popular media, military personnel in Vietnam appear to have had greater leeway in customizing their uniforms; sure, Vietnam’s climate was the root cause behind why troops chopped off their sleeves, but the reason why those modifications and any type of choice uniform artistry stuck around—not just in-country but in media—has everything to do with *supply and logistics.*

Vietnam wasn’t the first time that the American military had fought in humid jungle climate. World War II’s Pacific Theatre pitted the Americans against the Japanese in such jungle terrains as Guadalcanal. Since 1958, in fact, the American military has used part of the island of Okinawa as home to the Marine Corps’ Jungle Warfare Training Center. 

What made Vietnam different was the American military’s access to stable and secure supply lines, or, rather, its lack thereof. As the Department of the Army’s Vietnam Studies section notes in *Logical Support*: “For the first time in modern history, the U.S. Army was required to establish a major logistical base in a country where all areas were subject to continuous enemy observation and hostile fire, with no terrain under total friendly control.”

To cut through the military jargon, the Army is saying that, resupplying deep jungle patrols aside, *even setting up a supply base* in contested territory was a true challenge. Surrounded on all sides by jungle and villages, both of which could be home to Vietcong guerillas, any foothold carved out by the U.S. was in constant danger. Understandably, this meant that logistical bases, especially those deep in-country, could not be stocked with every good that Uncle Sam had to offer—often, there was only room for the bare essentials: fuel, firepower, and food. 

But say the military did set up a logistical base and would, periodically, send out active patrols from within its precarious position. What challenges would arise from that? The authors of *Logistical Support* point out another problem: “There was no communications zone; in fact, combat and communications zones were one and the same, and the logistics soldier was frequently and quite literally right with the front line tactical soldier.” Again, to translate, this meant that the guys who were supposed to be coordinating resupply—which could include uniform items—were, “frequently,” trudging through the jungle alongside the grunts. One can’t exactly fault a logistical troop for not focusing on logistics as he worries for his life on the frontlines. 

A second problem is found in the simple fact that much of Vietnam was covered in dense jungle. Considering that resupply vehicles took exactly three forms—truck, plane, and helicopter—it becomes clear that while shipping supplies into Vietnam was already an issue, actually *getting* those supplies to troops in the jungle was a whole different beast. Good luck driving a truck or landing a helicopter through dense vegetation. Airdropping supplies by plane was a good solution, but don’t forget the 3 F’s: fuel, firepower, and food! Those three were the priority and liquids, especially water, are heavy enough as-is. Simply put, it would be a waste to airdrop in uniforms, when what was most important was keeping troops in fighting shape. 

This didn’t mean that the U.S. was letting its men fight in tatters. According to *Logistical Support*, when troops deployed to Vietnam in July 1967, they received “five combat uniforms and two pairs of combat boots.” A month later, in August 1967, the number of uniforms was reduced to four, but the message remained the same: those uniforms were meant to last that troop through their whole tour. If a soldier or a marine modified those uniforms in any way, given the difficulty of resupply, it was *very* unlikely that they would be offered replacements. 

We can see evidence of the importance of intact supply lines in previous military engagements that were under similar, albeit more temporary, supply constraints. To return once more to WW2’s Guadalcanal, you can actually see many [pictures](https://images.app.goo.gl/WZDXeotsG5qEJuDf9) of Marines entirely leaving off their shirts as their man their posts. If you’ve ever seen the HBO series, *The Pacific*, you’d also note the general dirty, disheveled appearance of the Marines fighting on that island. This is because, during the Battle of Savo Island, the U.S. Navy was defeated by the Imperial Navy, leaving Marines onshore in Guadalcanal without many of their supplies. They did eventually manage to resupply, but not before the Marines on Guadalcanal endured a beating. 

Finally, I cannot comment on the durability of issued uniforms, but I can explain why some troops would continue to wear uniforms in various states of disrepair. This boils down a simple explanation: saltiness. A Marine scholar [once](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26439151?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) put it this way, writing in 1996: “As used in the Marine Corps more than 40 years ago when I was doing my bit by the Cold War, *salty* was usually, though by no means always, a term of praise. To speak of an NCO, for example, that he was salty was to speak of him very well indeed... he knew how to reduce his herringbone ‘utilities’ (Marine-speak for ‘fatigues’) from a dull dark green when issued to just the right shade of ghostliness.” In other words, a good sign—though not always—that you’re in the presence of a good Marine is the state of relative disrepair that their uniform is in. That scholar is, of course, only referencing the color of a “salty” Marine’s uniform, but the point remains the same: to a fighter in-country in Vietnam, the more scuffed your uniform looked, the more experience you had and the tougher you were. 

Nowadays, U.S. troops in the Middle East have much less leeway with what they can do to their uniforms. They can be constantly resupplied by the U.S.’ tactical superiority on all levels and, in the desert, keeping sleeves on protects against exposure to the sun. Also, tactically speaking, sleeves down protects a troop’s arms from being cut, typically when they move or fire from the prone position. But, even today, a “salty” military member will demonstrate their individuality with the faded color of their fatigues—the saltier they are, the lighter they’ll be.

It is important to note that his paranoia was not unfounded due to the widespread misinformation/disinformation campaigns by the Soviets.

People and events like the exposure of Kim Philby and the fact that operations like Operation Gold were compromised definitely contributed to the more unhinged part of his paranoia. "

"No, South Park were never as popular as the Simpsons in its ‘eat my shorts’ heyday. The highest rated Simpsons episode - and the highest rated episode on the Fox network at that point, full stop - was ‘Bart Gets An F’ (the debut episode of the second season) which apparently got 33.6 million viewers in the US; it should also be pointed out that it got those viewers while directly competing in the same timeslot as the Cosby Show (at that point one of the biggest shows on TV). 

In contrast, South Park inherently had a more limited viewership being on basic cable (as compared to The Simpsons on network TV). In the context of basic cable, South Park was absolutely a massive success in its early years - and it’s long been one of Comedy Central’s biggest cash cows. Like The Simpsons, in its heyday, South Park really was the kind of TV show that leaked into the Zeitgeist, and South Park t-shirts sold very well indeed, just as Bart Simpson t-shirts did in 1990. In 1998, Parker and Stone were profiled in a *New York Times* article that called South Park a ‘national phenomenon’. It’s essentially the same article as the profile of Matt Groening almost a decade earlier (‘who are these counterculture geniuses and how have they managed to be very popular while doing something very against the grain?’). 

But as far as I can tell, the biggest South Park episodes had something like 6 million viewers. This is a fraction of the Simpsons’ typical audience in its heyday (but which is a fair bit more than the typical 2021 Simpsons episode; those get more like 1-2 million viewers in the US these days due to more diverse markets and declining terrestrial TV watching). Basically, being on basic cable both made South Park able to get away with more than they would on network TV but also limited their audience."

"I have to admit that I've always been a bit skeptical of those grand climatic models. It makes sense, of course, that food shortages caused by drought or early frosts would destabilize already weakened political structures. But I tend to think that the evidence for traumatic climatic events in antiquity is too scattered and ambiguous to permit real analysis. 

In the case of the third-century Roman and Parthian collapses, the climatic case is stated by the article you link: a half-century or so of apparently cooler and less reliable weather, possibly caused by volcanic activity. Michael McCormick is an excellent and scrupulous scholar, and I have no reason whatsoever to doubt his research. I think, however, that the data he assembles does not in itself explain anything about Roman history that cannot be explained as well or better by purely political factors - in this case, the chronic inability of the Romans to manage succession crises, and structural weakness of the Parthian Empire."
"> It is hardly disputed that in the whole vast literature of witchcraft, the most prominent, the most important, the most authoritative volume is the *Malleus Maleficarum (The Witch Hammer)* of Heinrich Kramer (Henricus Institoris) and James Sprenger. The date of the first edition of the *Malleus* cannot be fixed with absolute certainty, but the likeliest year is 1486. There were, at any rate, fourteen editions between 1487 and 1520, and at least sixteen editions between 1574 and 1669. These were issued from the leading German, French and Italian presses. The latest reprint of the original text of the *Malleus* is to be found in the noble four volume collection of Treatises on Witchcraft, ""sumptibus Claudii Bourgeat"", 4to., Lyons, 1669. There is a German translation by J. W. R. Schmidt, *Der Hexenhammer*, 3 vols, Berlin, 1906; second edition, 1922-3. There is also an English translation with Introduction, Bibliography, and Notes by Montague Summers, published John Rodker, 1928. [...] In fact, ""it fastened on European jurisprudence for nearly three centuries the duty of combating"" the Society of Witches. The *Malleus* lay on the bench of every judge, on the desk of every magistrate. It was the ultimate, irrefutable, unarguable authority. It was implicitly accepted not only by Catholic but by Protestant literature. In fine, it is not too much to say that the *Malleus Maleficarum* is among the most important, wisest, and weightiest books of the world.

- Montague Summers, introduction to the [1948 edition](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RPml42hWGBIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR14&dq=malleus+maleficarum&ots=Loxt74IIBl&sig=RLuklKHbsBs8ne2KV5UF2p2ZUcI#v=onepage&q&f=false).

You have to take Summers with a grain of salt: while extremely erudite in the subject of the occult, the Reverend's actual belief and tendency toward exaltation of occult literature can skew the perception of facts a little. Nevertheless, it does emphasize that the *Malleus* was extraordinarily popular, and for an extensive period of time. A lot of this had to do with utility and demand.

If you look at the volumes available to authorities on witchcraft in the period, you have works like Johannes Nider's *Formicarius* (1475); while this was popular and helped define the image and concept of the witch as we know it, this work was not geared toward either a lay audience or legal use since it was quite literally written as a teacher-student dialogue on the lives of ants. The section on witchcraft was actually absorbed into the *Malleus*.

And authorities at the period *needed* a work on heresy and witchcraft. Civil courts and authorities were under greater pressure to work with ecclesiastic courts and authorities to address both heresy and *maleficium*, and the framework of Roman Law which was highly influential on the courts of Europe required a certain amount of legalistic wrangling to deal with the contemporary issues of witchcraft. While the Protestant Reformation had not yet occurred, there were still schisms within the church, which inquisitors rooted out as heresy. H. R. Trevor-Roper in [The European Witch-Craze of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries](http://www.worldcat.org/title/european-witch-craze-of-the-sixteenth-and-seventeenth-centuries/oclc/426461901) writes:

> When the Dominicans pressed for inquisitorial power over witchcraft, the papacy had at first resisted. The old canons of the Church, and particularly the *canon Episcopi*, denied the reality of witches and forbade their persecution. Therefore, in 1257, Pope Alexander IV had refused these demands unless manifest heresy, not merely witchcraft, could be proved. But little by little, under constant pressure, the papacy had yielded.  The great surrender had been made by the French popes of Avignon, and particularly by the two popes from southern France, John XXII and his successor Benedict XII, who had already, as bishops in Languedoc, waged war on nonconformity in the old Albigensian and Vaudois areas. John XXII, who declared heretical the Franciscan doctrine of the poverity of Christ (so dangerously akin to the old Vaudois ideas), also, by his constitution *Super illius specula* of 1325, authorized he full use of inquisitorial procedure against witches, of who he lived in personal terror. For the next century and a half--until the Witch Bull of Innocent VIII, and indeed afterwards--the main effort of the inquisitors (although there were some spectacular 'political' witchcraft trials in France, Burgundy and England) had been directed against the witches of the Alps and the Pyrenees.

Summers gives a good run-down of some of the ""political"" witchcraft trials in his introduction to the *Malleus*; sorcery was effectively the civil counterpart to the ecclesiastical charge of heresy, and civil authorities could actually pass mortal sentences, which ecclesiastical courts could not--this was the standard inquisitorial practice, to hand over heretics to secular authorities for further persecution and punishment. This practice applied to all cases before the inquisition, not just the political ones, so as the *scope* of the inquisition expanded to include witchcraft, the need by civil authorities to address the question of witchcraft expanded as well. This brings us to Pope Innocent VIII, who in 1484:

> [...] issued *Summis desiderantes* at the request of two Dominican inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer (or Institoris) and Jacob Sprenger, who had worked in southern Germany and encountered some resistance in their search for heretics. The Bull formally removes all impediments to the completion of Kramer and Sprenger's mission.

- Edward Peters, [The Magician, The Witch, and the Law](http://www.worldcat.org/title/magician-the-witch-and-the-law/oclc/751378767), 170

Peters goes on to note that the Papal bull was not, in itself, remarkable - previous popes had issued bulls with much the same language and for much the same purpose, to authorize members of the clergy and clear away local opposition. However, two years after it was issue, it was included as the preface to the *Malleus Maleficarum* - a text Innocent himself had probably never seen - and in that context, being bundled with the book, gave the book greater authority, beyond even the area of Germany which most concerned the inquisitors. This in part helped its transmission, but the other part is the nature of the book itself. Peters 173-174:

> All scholars agree that the form of the work, that of a series of scholastic *quaestiones*, derives from handbooks for inquisitors, of which Eymeric's is the best example. Within the framework of *quaestiones* arranged into three major parts, owever, the work is intellectually inferior to Eymeric's and hardly to be considered ""scholastic"" in the original sense of that term at all. What is striking about the *Malleus* is its economic use of the *quaestio* form to bring together elements from all of the diverse sources that had provided elements of the new fifteenth-century beliefs in magic in the first place. The juxtaposition of these elements in a single, concentrated, tightly argued treatise of considerably greater length than any earlier work really constituted the basis of the popularity of the *Malleus* during the next two centuries. [...] In no other work are theology and law so tightly linked. Even if, as I have suggested above, the *Malleus* made no discernible impact on the prosecution of magicians and witches for nearly half a century, no comparable work approached its comprehensiveness until those of Bodin and Remy, Del Rio and Boguet, at the end of the sixteenth century.

The *Malleus* was not alone in its generation. Writings about witchcraft, even printed works, were extensive, with titles like *Tractatus contra Daemonum Invocatores* (1450) by Jean Vinet, *Fortalicium fidei contra fidei christianae hostes* (1467) by Alfonso de Spina, *Flagellum Maleficorum* (c.1490) by Petrus Mamoris. The *Laienspiegel* (1509) by Ulrich Tengler in particular was incredibly popular, because like the *Malleus* it was a legal work looking at the different aspects of witchcraft in regard to private, public, and criminal law; it went through fourteen editions. But the *Malleus* was uniquely suited to spread, because of its relatively early date, because it was organized in a manner useful to legal authorities, and because the spread of the printing press made it much more accessible to this ready market that was in demand for such a way. Judges and magistrates required a legal text for dealing with the problems posed by accusations of sorcery and heresy, and the *Malleus* was almost encyclopedic compared to other contemporary texts.

This, combined with the popularity of the *Malleus* and its relative accessibility also made it something of an authority on witchcraft which many subsequent demonologists would refer to, quote from, or cite as a reference; a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy where a book is popular because it is known to be popular. While there is a popular rumor that it was banned by the Church and placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, I haven't been able to confirm that with any of my sources at hand. "

"Black Hebrew mythology originates from the same place as Black Jewish synagogues, which furthermore is not terribly different from black perspectives on Islam. All of these groups came to prominence in the first decades of the twentieth century, with the Muslims organized into the Nation of Islam a few decades later. Black Americans emerged from slavery, where they were often given a purposefully censored view of Christianity by their enslavers, combined with analogies spread amongst themselves to the sacred history of Moses leading the Jews to freedom. Excluded from white churches and seminaries, they often saw the white Christian establishment as having created an institutional hypocrisy, and sought out alternative ways of defining themselves as an ethnic-national group.

Because Jim Crow racial norms held that black people were a separate nation “from Africa” in an otherwise European continent, Jews were an easy reference point, considering how they admitted to non-European origins. As whites drew legal boundaries to prevent blacks from intermarrying or participating in civic life, the success of the Jews despite self-imposed racial boundaries was again an easy reference point. Blacks who attempted to implement Judaism for themselves were accused of mimicry and fraud by ethnic Jewish rabbis, which immediately led to the rhetoric you probably heard from Ye/Kanye West or Kyrie Irving this week:

> The assertion that Judaism was uniquely suited to black people went hand in hand with the claim by some black Jews that Jews of European ancestry were in fact frauds or ""interlopers:' Prophet Cherry, for example, often quoted Revelation 3:9 (""Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie, behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and learn that I have loved you"") in support of his belief that white Jews were religious impostors. Rabbi Arnold Ford taught that the ""real"" Jews were black people, while Jews of European descent were said to be ""offshoots"" of the original lineage of black Jews or converts who had received the religion secondhand from Africans. 

However, these quotes are from 100 years ago and were spoken by (self-appointed) black rabbis! You can see [a 1923 photo of a Black Jewish women’s choir](https://works.swarthmore.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1404&context=fac-religion#page=9) in the article I am quoting this from. As that article notes, this is very similar to the Nation of Islam “Yakub” mythology of the 1960s in its provocative intent.

Some Black Americans converted all the way to practicing Judaism and continue to practice it today. The Jewish community has grown much more understanding of Black Judaism over the decades, which has led to racial integration from the ethnic Jewish side and better understanding of Jewish historical orthodoxy on the Black Jewish side, although relations remain awkward sometimes (you can see discussions on this on Jewish news sites). You also mentioned the Nation of Islam, which underwent a similar process; the group began when Americans in general had a poor understanding of Islam, so it used Muslim and Jewish symbols freely, but now the original branches of that group promote orthodox Islam and dialogue with Judaism. 

Outside these groups, though, rhetoric about an African Israel continued to mix with other beliefs about African identity and racial unity. This rhetoric is often eclectic, meaning there is no institutional organization to it, and no one person who propagates this kind of mythology; it circulates in in-person lectures and in self-published books, and academic research about it is similarly scattershot. Unfortunately, although Black Hebrew mythology originated as a legitimating device for black expression of Judaism, after being divorced from its initial context for decades and appropriated by wholly different groups with different motives, it has now become a flimsy justification for hateful antisemitic remarks."

"Well, apparently the U.S. was doing some covert recruiting in England and Ireland in addition to the above-board encouragement of immigration from western Europe. Just, never quite enough to make the British anything more than vaguely suspicious. Meanwhile, on American soil, British consuls informed British subjects of an 1861 law that barred them from serving in *either* side's army. Just, never quite loudly enough to make the Americans anything more than vaguely suspicious.

Well, except for that time in Philadelphia and that other time in Chicago, but I digress.

You can read about the (lack of) historicity of that particular scene a bunch of places online, so I'll address your actual questions: (1) how easily were immigrants conscripted (2) potential effects on immigration.

As the Civil War ground on, both the U.S. and Confederacy had an increasingly dire need for more soldiers. One of the ways that both sides sought to accomplish this goal was by lowering and lowering the bar of who counted as *enough of* a citizen to serve, and eventually, to be conscripted. That effort had to be balanced with potential diplomatic costs, since they also each needed trading partners on their side.

Traditionally, military membership in the U.S. was done at the state level, not national (something something ""Confederate"" flag something). Well, because the Civil War was absolutely, 100% about states' rights and the tyranny of a federal government (*narrator: it was, in fact, not about states' rights*), *Confederate president* Jefferson Davis signed North America's first national-level conscription act in 1862. It applied to ""white men who are residents of the Confederate States."" Well, that's pretty ambiguous as to who counts as a ""resident."" 

Indeed, foreign consuls--especially the British and French--were pulling the equivalent of all-nighters before finals week to issue certificates of exemption to their country's citizens. (Or to naturalized American citizens who decided to self-issue an unnaturalization.) And apparently, the Confederacy was mostly willing to honor that, even to the extent of discharging nonnaturalized immigrants if they were conscripted by accident. Well, or by kidnapping, which may or may not have actually happened but got a lot of press for doing so.

As you might expect, mounting casualties and ongoing war made the Confederacy decreasingly likely to accept certificates of exemption.

The United States likewise faced the problem of who counted as ""enough of"" an American to serve. As late as 1862, Secretary of State William Seward was promising that only full American citizens holding U.S. passports would be conscripted. Certifications of exemption from state-level conscription were in high demand here, too. The New York consul noted wryly that almost overnight, Irish immigrants went from desperate to shed their British citizenship to the proudest British citizens in the world.

The turning point in the U.S. was the Conscription Act (or Enrollment Act) passed in spring 1863, which changed the bar from ""citizen"" to ""having declared an oath to of intention to seek citizenship someday."" It automatically applied to older and recent immigrants who had already done so, and apparently some new arrivals were trapped by it as well. A follow-up provision mandated that men who had declared intent and didn't want to serve had a grand total of 65 days to leave the U.S.

Other factors aligned to make immigrants particularly vulnerable. The Act had built in an exemption: if you could pay someone to take your spot or pay the government $300, you could skate on your merry way. Poorer workers--immigrant and native alike--were the ones unable to pay. And who among them could afford to pack up their lives and families and pay the costs of moving to another country? In Ohio, trying to meet its state-level quota after the 1862 Militia Act, potential draft dodgers might be arrested. People complained to their pastors and priests that bosses were closing factories and other jobs *temporarily*--just temporarily enough to put them in such need of money they'd enlist to serve. On the other hand, media stories about Irish immigrants resorting to desperate measure to avoid conscription were less news than *xenophobic* propaganda.

Whatever problems arose at home, the U.S. did a fair enough job balancing their diplomatic and military needs. Their own consuls abroad even recruited new immigrants by talking up all the jobs that were going to be waiting for them in the South once the war was won and slavery was abolished. Meanwhile, the U.S. government dangled immediate citizenship upon honorable discharge from the military as a positive rather than negative recruitment tool. The Civil War didn't have an effect on *immigration* so much as it did on *citizenship*.

This is exactly the kind of question I was hoping to answer! Thank you!

First of all, I completely understand where the idea of ""bland brutalism"" comes from, as well as the idea that the Metro's beauty is entirely separate from that bland brutalism. However, that distinction is not exactly accurate. Stalin was not at all a fan of blandness or Brutalism — his opposition to the former is a large part of the answer, so stay tuned, and he couldn't have been a fan of Brutalism because it didn't exist. But the Metro is not the only piece of architecture that rejects simplicity or blandness in Moscow from Stalin's lifetime. In fact, Stalin is most associated with ""Stalinist Classicism"", which is very ornate, so it wasn't just restricted to the Metro. Example: [MGU, Moscow State University.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2019-06/shutterstock_145498807.jpg) Commonly cited as the pinnacle of the style, but built from 1949 to 1953, a little after the critical period I will discuss below. I did not study there myself, sadly.

I still have a lot to learn about Khrushchev's and Brezhnev's visions for Moscow, for socialist architecture, and for the Metro, so I will focus on Stalin in this answer, but for now I will say this: Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev (or rather the Soviet state and culture during their tenures as First/General Secretary, because I'm a good post-post-revisionist) envisioned their construction of housing and of the Metro as part of the same ideological project to bring comfort and beauty into the lives of Soviet citizens. The difference is that Khrushchev and Brezhnev focused much more on the utilitarian side of that mission than Stalin. So their Metro station designs see a lot of simplification compared to Stalinist Metro stations just like their residential architecture sees compared to Stalinist residences. Nothing that any of those three built was ever supposed to be bland, or purely functional, though.

So why did Stalin decide to build a ""grandiose"", ""ornate"" Metro system, as you describe it? There are a few reasons, some of which are emphasized and some of which get overlooked, and I am apparently making it my life's mission to bring those overlooked ones to attention.

___

***Part 1: Competition With the West***

There are two reasons that everyone jumps to, and that has sort of stifled the public understanding of the Metro a little. The first reason that everyone jumps to is that Stalin and the Soviets wanted to show off to, and compete with, the West. This is an understandable conclusion to come to — much of the propaganda surrounding the Metro is couched, subtly or not, in terms that compare it to the systems of London, Paris, Berlin, and New York. Stalin and the party were indeed very intent on proving the triumphs of socialism, and the Metro was to be the greatest example of that. Especially during the construction of the first line from 1931 to 1935 and in the early days of operation in the '30s, *Pravda* and other press organs certainly crowed a lot about how the subway systems of those Western cities were darker, dirtier, uglier, more crowded, all in all just inferior, and how the Moscow Metro outshone (literally and figuratively) them all.

This gets a much shorter explanation than the other factors later, not necessarily because it's less true, but because it's a little easier to wrap your head around, and I think most of us have an intuitive sense of it. And maybe it is a little less true as well.

___

***Part 2: The Congestion Problem and Soviet Comfort***

But that's a little bit Euro-ego-centric. None of that is false, but it is far from the only reason Stalin and the party had in mind for building the Metro. Which brings us to the second commonly-trotted-out reason, which is that Stalin really did want to improve the lives of his people. This one is a little tricky. I won't go too far into the history of Metro planning in Moscow, but let's talk about congestion.

The main means of public transport in Moscow in the late 19th and even into the 20th century was the horse-drawn tram car. Electrification of the tram network began in the late 1890s, and was completed by 1911, but even then, much of Moscow remained reliant on horse-carts. Although trams didn't produce manure, they caused terrible congestion in the center of Moscow too. Dietmar Neutatz, whose book *Die Moskauer Metro* is the gold standard on the history of traffic planning in Moscow until 1935, describes a tram network already ""at the borders of the possible"" in the 1910s, with the main streets completely ""jammed with trolleys"" [my translation]. (38) This is, in fact, what led to the first ideas for a light rail/rapid transit network in Moscow in 1902, but that never got off the ground.

Congestion was improved, in a very darkly comic way, by the war. WW1 forced the tsarist regime to shelve plans for a subway due to budget concerns, but then the need for those plans was suddenly removed by the Civil War, which led to a massive depopulation of Moscow and a massive decrease in tram ridership (nearly half the 1915 population fled Moscow for the countryside by 1920). However, as soon as the Civil War ended, people began to trickle, and then flood, back to Moscow, especially because of the economic flexibility introduced with the NEP. In 1924, the Moscow City Council (Mossovet) came to the conclusion that, by 1928, the tram network would be entirely incapable of handling the required load. They began a new plan for a Metro, but for reasons I will talk about later, it was not implemented.

By 1929, the tram network was operating at 150% capacity, sidewalks were impassable, streetcars were overflowing with people, and dozens of preventable injuries happened each week when people lost their hold or were pushed off overcrowded trams and fell behind them, or even worse, in front of them. This is all according to the other great work on the planning and construction of the first line, William Wolf's *Russia's Revolutionary Underground*. And this is all as industrialization and dekulakization are beginning to send an even further mass of people into Moscow. Between 1928 and 1933, thanks to those programs, the population of Moscow ballooned from 2.3 million to 3.6 million, and I'll say it again: that's 1.3 million more people in just *five years*.

So something desperately did need to be done by 1931. But in order to answer the question of whether Stalin and his subordinates really were motivated by altruism, we have to ask, was a Metro really the best way to improve the lives of Moscow's people? I would say it wasn't the *best* way — investment in new housing was even more desperately needed, and transport to outlying parts of the city would probably have helped more people, even if the problem was mainly in the center. Building a Metro certainly did improve many people's lives by giving them a shorter and easier commute. But that didn't really become accessible to many people until the later 1930s, or even after WW2 for some parts of the city. So the idea of the altruistic motive isn't wrong, but it's not the full picture either.

So now let's get back to that question of beauty. The way that these two tropes above were employed, I argue, can tell us a lot about why beauty was so important."
"> You may be one of only a few people around with ready access to the royal road (Qhapaq Ñan) that isn’t military - the road is for imperial business alone.

If you were someone without rights to access the road, say a rural farmer that needs to go to a larger town for whatever reason, maybe to buy something unusual, or to bring something to sell, how do you get there?

Are you allowed to walk on the shoulder of the road?  What happens if you are caught traveling on the royal road without appropriate permission?

Would it be possible for such a person to get a permit to use the road, or would they have to figure out another path?  Was there a non governmental informal roadway for this purpose?

Sorry if that’s a lot of questions at once, I don’t need them separately answered or anything, I’m just curious of the logistics of a roadway most people aren’t allowed to use."
"> Near the beginning of his History, Livy - talking about Rhea Silvia, the mother of Romulus and Remus - observes that Rhea ""named Mars as their father, either because she really believed it, or because the fault might appear less heinous if a deity were the cause of it.""3 Here, at least, we see that ancient authors understood why women might make such a claim. It is less clear how often historical women actually did.

This seems quite a scandalous and unpatriotic thing to say, almost blasphemous. Did he ever catch any heat for it, or were his Roman contemporaries less sold on the Rome ""creation myth"" at that time?"
"Happy to! For the first 80 or so years of the Regents exams, the students most likely to want a NYS High School diploma were white, non-disabled, and most likely to be from a family with some social slack or capital or the young person was interested in a job that required a diploma or wanted to attend college, which often required one. Young people who weren't interested in such things simply didn't graduate - which, at the time, didn't have the social stigma it has today. Or, they just stopped school at 8th grade. There were laws on the books about compulsory attendance until the age of 15 (later changed to 16, then 17) but there was no real mechanism for keeping children in school. 

***(Edit to clarify: yes, my fellow NYers, there is such a thing as a non-Regents aka Local aka General diploma - as well as a Regents with Distinction diploma - but I didn't want to overwhelm non-NYers with too many details about our unique structure as it's pushing the limits around the scope of the question. Thanks to those who reminded me about them!)*** 

To give you a sense of the scope of the system, the Regents exam offered in 1879 included:

* Rhetoric and English composition
* English literature
* Algebra, through quadratics
* Plane geometry
* Plane trigonometry
* American history
* Science of government
* Political economy
* General history
* Classical geography and antiquities
* Physical geography
* Physiology and hygiene
* Zoology
* Astronomy
* Chemistry
* Botany
* Geology
* German
* Latin grammar and exercises
* Caesar's Commentaries, books 1-2
* Caesar's Commentaries, books 3-4
* Virgil's Aeneid, books 1-2
* Virgil's Aeneid, books 3-6
* Greek grammar (except Prosody)
* Greek grammar (Prosody)
* Homer's Iliad
* Xenophon's Anabasis, books 2-3
* Xenophon's Anabasis, book 1
* French grammar and exercises
* French translations
* Natural philosophy
* Mental philosophy
* Moral philosophy
* Bookkeeping
* Drawing, freehand and mechanical
* Eclogues of Virgil
* Latin prose composition
* Sallust's Catiline
* Sallust's Jugurthine War
* Cicero in Catalinam
* Cicero pro Lege Manilia
* Cicero pro Archiam

In the mid-1900s, especially following World War II and the subsequent Baby Boom, *Brown v. Board*, the passage of *IDEA*, etc. high school became something every NY child did, regardless of race, disability, citizenship status, or language abilities and the sentiment about the diploma changed. Young people who left high school without a diploma were referred to as ""drop-outs"" and NYS was faced with an unwieldy system that required the creation of hundreds of different Regents exams. So they started to streamline. Some streamlining began in the 1930s when exams like all those Cicero exams were combined into *Comprehensive Latin* or the philosophy stand-alone exams became *Comprehensive Philosophy.*

But the streamlining beginning in the 1980s REALLY cut down the count - and normed the NYS HS experience - by focusing on the big 5 (as it were): English, Math, History, Science, and a foreign language (Hebrew was offered up until the 1990s, I believe, but before the exam was eliminated a few years ago, students mostly took French, Spanish, or German.) There have been policy shifts around exactly how many and that's not likely to end any time soon.

However, even though topics like Homemaking AKA Family and Consumer Sciences were still deemed important enough to students' education that NYS requires all students take a formal FACS course at some point and many schools offer MS and HS courses. Which is to say, the course is still going strong, even if the Regents exam has faded away."
"Hey there,

If you've come to the thread and are wondering why there's no answer yet: [we have found](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7s66yf/a_statistical_look_at_askhistorians_in_2017_part_i/) that it takes an average of 9 hours for a good answer to appear on a popular thread - properly researching and writing an answer takes time. Additionally, it's late at night on the East Coast of the US at the moment, which means that plenty of the historians interested in this topic might already be asleep. 

In other words, patience, good people. If you want to be reminded to look at this thread later, [please see this really awesome Roundtable post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8p0s9b/roundtable_21_be_kindremind_the_mod_approved/) for a list of ways. And if you're wondering why Reddit never shows you an AskHistorians thread with answers, consider sorting your Reddit home feed by 'Hot' rather than 'Best' - 'Best' seems to give precedence to newer posts (which are less likely to have an answer on this subreddit, of course) and threads you haven't already looked at (e.g., it'll show you something else next time you log in, even if this thread is still getting lots of upvotes because there's an actual answer now).

If you're wondering what's in the 28 removed comments at the time of writing, the majority of it is people saying things like ""I want to know the answer to this question [or some other related question, in which case start a new thread!]"", ""what happened to all the removed comments?"" or making a tossed off one sentence answer that doesn't meet our standards, like ""CHRISTIANS!"". None of this comes close to meeting the standards in [our subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules). There are also three posts we've removed because they're more substantial than these, but largely or entirely focus on sexuality in Ancient Greece (and thus don't answer the question about the Victorian era that OP is clearly interested in). All of these comments get removed on /r/AskHistorians because the huge majority of our subscribers really do want accurate, comprehensive, in-depth historical answers based on good historical practice and high-quality sources. It's amazing how many downvotes and reports an obvious shitpost can attract on a popular thread on /r/AskHistorians within minutes, thanks to our readers (if you see it, report it!) 

On /r/AskHistorians, we want people answering questions to be able to explain not just what the basic facts are according to academic research, [but why we know that these basic facts are right, and to put those basic facts into context](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_write_an_in-depth_answer). This is why we encourage [the use of primary and secondary sources in answering questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_sources), rather than tertiary sources like Wikipedia, podcasts and textbooks.

In other words, on /r/AskHistorians, we'd rather have no answer than bad attempts at answers. By removing the short, quick, bad answers that would otherwise crowd them out, the well-researched in-depth answers (that take people time to research and write) are more likely to be seen ([see this graph for more detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/64y44g/the_mostupvoted_comments_in_reddit_threads_arent/#)). The downside to this is that we have to remove a lot of shitposts and comments wondering what happened to the removed comments. The upside is that our contributors consistently post amazing stuff to /r/AskHistorians (which we collate the best of every week in our [Sunday Digest](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)), and daily on [our Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/AskHistorians). Alternatively, if you want to discuss history without these constraints, /r/history or /r/askhistory might be more appropriate subreddits for you than /r/AskHistorians.

"The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps track of wages for specific occupations in the country including geographic breakdowns.  We can use their data to answer your question.

Looking in the `NAICS 448200 - Shoe Stores` category the closest match to ""shoe salesman"" looks to me to be [41-2031 Retail Salespersons](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes412031.htm) but we can also look at some adjacent jobs like `First-Line Supervisors of Sales Workers` and `Sales Managers` to get a range depending on how loosely you want to interpret the results.

Before 1997 (the last year the show was on the air) wage data is not available on a per occupation basis through the BLS.  Reference here: https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm

So let's start with 1997:

Segment | Title | Total Employment | Annual Mean Wage | Annual Median Wage
---|---|----|----|----|----
Shoe Stores | Salespersons, Retail | 129,670 | $14,144 | $12,646

Screenshot of the report [here](https://i.imgur.com/aeq7uYX.png).

Sales Management positions can rise to $28,000 in the report.

Of course, that's national data so we need to scope it to the Chicago area.  

The Chicago area report for that occupation code gives the mean value as slightly higher: $18,350 (Screenshot [here](https://i.imgur.com/vwwPQP0.png))

**So it is reasonable to assume that in 1997 Al's salary would be around $18,000 +/- $5,000 depending on his specific title and how successful he personally was**.

After taxes that would be about $13,500 / year.

Given that this is a fictional show I'm comfortable moving forward with that estimate.

Now let's figure out what kind of lifestyle that yearly income would afford.

The University of Missouri has a variety of resources that are helpful [here](https://libraryguides.missouri.edu/pricesandwages/1990-1999#location) from historical rents to fuel and food prices.

Based on this data and making some assumptions a reasonable guess is that Al would have paid $450 a month for his house, about $5,400 /year.  We can say that his transportation costs in car maintenance and gas would be about $2,000 / year and that the cost of feeding his family (assuming a relatively modest diet) would be about $4,000 / year. 

Already we're up to about $11,000 a year.

And then, of course, there's utility costs, clothing, entertainment, etc.

_Tl;Dr: Things would have been tight in the Bundy household but passes the 'at all realistic' test if you make some very favorable assumptions about Al's spending habits, the location of his home, and his exact title and productivity at work._"
"That’s explicitly as written from the transcript I have of his speech. And *2st* occurs several times in the document. So I assume it is original and correct. ~~But I’m afraid I don’t know for certain how it was used in the 1780s.~~

Edit: As /u/SeattleBattles points out below this does indeed appear to be a repeated error in the transcript I was using. I clearly shouldn’t have assumed and done a touch more research."
"As a follow-up to your first paragraph, does that mean that Roman men would refer to each other in a more casual/conversational context by just the praenomen?

"I will provide a quick answer with a few sources while we wait for more on in this interesting topic.

The quick answer is that in the mid 17th century, a pair of scientists in France lugged a mercury barometer a mile up (1.5km) up an extinct volcano to see if elevation changed the height of the mercury column.  It did, in fact, ~~increase~~ decrease\*!  Discussing what this meant, the pair concluded that the weight of air above an elevation decreases as you climb.  They reasoned that if you went high enough, you would find a vacuum.  This was fairly revolutionary, as most scientists at the time thought that space was filled with some invisible matter such as ether.\*\*

The pair of scientists were Blaise Pascal and his brother-in-law Florin Perier.  Pascal's contribution to hydrostatics and hydrodynamics was recognized by applying his name to the SI unit of pressure, Pascals.  101325 Pa is equivalent to 1 standard atmosphere pressure at sea level.

But what did this mean for engineers?  Still centuries away from air travel, let alone space travel, it wasn't useful for that.  But the scientific understanding from hydrostatic pressure -- which works for a fluid such as air or water -- impacted the engineering of dams and oceangoing vessels long before the 20th century.  Such as in the 18th century, British engineers began building large-scale arch dams, which were shaped to push against the pressure as the water deepened.  By the 19th century, submarine designs must deal with hydrostatic pressure.  By the 20th century, air and space travel became a reality.

On the fiction side, travel between the Earth and other heavenly bodies has been the source of myths and stories for hundreds of years.  But works prior to the late 19th century were more fantasy than science fiction.  In 1856, Reuss wrote *Hviezdoveda or Životopis Krutohlava* in which a man journeyed to the moon via a balloon and returned in a dragon-like machine to explore the rest of the solar system.  Just a decade later Jules Verne, who wrote *From the Earth to the Moon*, is the earliest popular science fiction author who recognized some of the life support challenges when departing the Earth's atmosphere -- his fictional engineers must deal with removing carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used.

Verne raised awareness with his works -- it was then more commonly understood that any crew would have to traverse through a vacuum once they left Earth.

"Do you mind going into more detail why you prefer McCune-Reischauer to Revised?

I find the diacritics exoticize the language far more than necessary and believe the words to be difficult for the unitiated to pronounce based on how they are spelled.  Hangeul is quite easy to learn and I feel like including the Hangeul along with Revised Romanization in the text wouldn't confuse any academic in the field of East Asian Studies.  

It's true that McCune is still the go-to in the academic world but it seems somewhat archaic to me and other younger Koreaphiles."
"Definitely! *Wickard* is a good sign of how much the tide had shifted in the realm of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce. Elsewhere in the thread /u/bleepbloop1990 and /u/chadtr5 have really excellent discussions on that area of legal doctrine.

I would also point to *United States v. Carolene Products Company*, 304 U.S. 144 (1938), as marking a growing shift beyond just the interstate commerce power. *Carolene* products and its famous footnote number 4 give courts a very relaxed standard of review of the vast majority of federal legislation. Basically, a federal statute is constitutionally permissible if courts can come up with some ""legitimate government interest"" that the law is ""rationally related"" to solving. Pretty much anything can past muster under rational basis review.

The change was starting to happen before *Wickard* and *Carolene* (and outside the courts) but these decisions do mark the Supreme Court stamping its approval on this broad shift."
This is such a great response and a good reminder that we shouldn't place modern beliefs/values on historical events and issues.  Those things change over time and can lead to misconceptions.
"This is fascinating.  The origins of concepts we now find ubiquitous, such as ""the floor is impassable"" games, while perhaps impossible to trace, are nonetheless a curiosity.

Follow-up:  Is there a period in time where such things as children's games, perhaps often overlooked because of their perceived unimportance, became noteworthy and more commonly documented in contemporary writings?"
"I don't know of any cases of the WWII allies being tried under international law. There have been domestic court martial trials for individuals (e.g. Lt. William Calley and the My Lai Massacre). 

It is a cynical thing to say, but in general it is the losers of wars that end up in the docket at the Hague (or Nuremberg), not the winners. The US is in particular very wary about being bound by the judgment of international law (they do not recognize the authority of the International Court of Justice and have a very complicated relationship with the International Criminal Court), in part because it will not submit it actions to international scrutiny or approval. If that makes you wonder about the utility of things like the Geneva Conventions, you would not be the first, but perhaps we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good — it is probably better to have norms that are occasionally broken than not to have them at all."
"I’m not OP, but I want to say a sincere thank you for your response! I’ve recently been learning that people understand the distinctions between political left and right in very different ways (particularly in America), and I have actually been very curious as to how issues of economics and governing policy seem to have become second fiddle to cultural issues for many voters. Your response has shed a lot of light on the process of that change."

"A word of warning, noble sir. I believe your intentions with regard to the Cimmerians and Scythians are just - they need to feel the yoke of civilization. But when the topic of invading their land is raised, there is reference only to the attempts of peoples like the Swedes and the Germans. These were not the first to try their hand at it. Many centuries earlier, Cyrus, Great King, King of Babylon, King of the Four Corners of the Earth, King of the Universe, also invaded the land of the Scythians, but he came to a bad end, and his expedition floundered. Then a few generations later, my lord and uncle, Darius, invaded again, marching through Thrace and across the Danube with all the peoples over which he ruled. But the Scythians - uncivilised liars all - refused to engage him in battle. They left their land desolate and retreated, again and again, until my lord Darius' supplies were depleted, and he was forced to withdraw.^1 Many were killed in the retreat, preyed upon by the mounted archers of the enemy. While Darius obviously conquered the place, since no one resisted him, it was a bit harder to enforce the demands of the Great King once the army had left their lands. This was a blemish on the otherwise glorious career of Darius, conqueror of Thrace and Naxos and Euboea and vanquisher of the rebellious cities of the Yauna that dwell by the sea.

"If I can be permitted a metacomment, the problem is that many questions in the subreddit seem to be asked by people who either just want to link in an existing resource or answer or who seem in some sense to want the answers here to provide that link. So in the case of this question, it's not hard to find an Atlas Obscura page that in turn links to and summarizes a book about the history of gunpowder and explosives by Jack Kelly, a novelist and popular history writer. It is perhaps worth standing against the common tendency on Reddit to churn the same links and films over and over again. If the question is worth asking here, it is worth being patient and waiting to see if there is a historian (amateur, professional, it doesn't matter) who has direct specialized knowledge that goes beyond the terms of Atlas Obscura's summary of Kelly's work.

"I have Russian origin, my parents lived through that time, and I'm deeply interested in different topics of history, but I'm not a professional historian by any means. I hope the quality of my answer and my sources will satisfy the standards of this subreddit.

When we talk about clothing and consumer goods in the Soviet Union in general, two things are important to understand: everything ""Western"", starting from simple blue jeans, was automatically a status symbol and getting nice clothes was a challenge because the planned economy rarely produced what the customers wanted. It led to the emergence of ""the second economy"", a huge black market the size of a country. A fairly detailed description of this phenomenon is provided in [this paper](https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1986-620-5-O'Hearn.pdf). Although it was written in the mid-80s, the phenomenon it describes had been evolving, I'd say, since at least the early 70s.

Now let's get to tracksuits in general and Adidas tracksuits in particular. Adidas was one of the very first ""Western"" brands the Soviet citizens learned about: already in the 1960s they saw athletes from the friendly German Democratic Republic wearing Adidas tracksuits during the events that were shown on TV. Don't forget that back then the USSR had a [sizeable military presence in East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Soviet_Forces_in_Germany), and while contacts between the soldiers and the locals were limited, it was absolutely possible to buy German consumer goods, bring them to the Soviet Union and re-sell with a huge margin. 

Love for Adidas increased tenfold right after the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. For many Soviet citizens, the Olympics were a window to the West that opened in an instant and introduced many consumer goods (still a ""deficit"") previously unheard of - for example, Coca Cola ([see here, not an academic source](https://www.rbth.com/history/330168-soviet-pepsico-and-coca-cola)) and Pepsi ([here](https://www.rbth.com/business/327568-pepsi-first-russia) - its production started earlier but by anecdotal evidence it was completely out of reach for the average Soviet citizen).

For the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Adidas manufactured the sportswear for the Soviet team. However, the USSR Communist party leaders forbid to put the labels of the capitalist company on tracksuits of Soviet athletes. Traditional three stripes were limited to one red. The dress shoes preserved its stripes, since the stripes resembled the letter “M”, stressing that the Olympics were taking place in Moscow. Although the company name did not appear on clothing, sneakers and tracksuits Adidas become wildly popular in USSR. Since then, it became THE sports wear label. According to some sources, Adidas even started production in the Soviet Union in 1979. Some more info can be found in [this article from Sueddeutsche Zeitung](https://worldcrunch.com/business-finance/retro-sports-diplomacy-adidas-and-the-iron-curtain) and there is even a [book on the subject](https://www.amazon.de/Unternehmen-Sport-Die-Geschichte-adidas/dp/3827501229). ""Western"" clothes, famous German quality and no alternatives - comfortable Adidas tracksuits were bound to succeed.

Now, how did Adidas tracksuits stay popular until 2000? (They are still popular today, I'll just omit the last 20 years not to break the subreddit rules). To answer this question, let's take a look at what happened right after the collapse of the Soviet union. With the economy in shambles and underfunded police, organized crime took hold. Being in a gang was the fastest way to get rich, and the newly rich almost always had some ties to the organized crime. Gangs actively recruited former police officers, veterans and athletes. [This paper](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/187085.pdf) provides more info on the phenomenon: although it's focused on one Russian region, the situation was the same throughout the country. (There are quite a lot of academic sources on the subject, this was the one with its full text freely available without registration). Tracksuits became the uniform of the mob because they still were the status symbol from the Soviet times and because this is what so many former athletes, now in the mob, used to wear. I didn't have enough time to find good sources on the role of ""romance of prison"" in Russia in the 90s but I'm sure there are plenty. The younger generation, fascinated by the mob and the prison culture, followed suit (no pun intended) - that's how the *gopnik* culture was born and Adidas tracksuits gained popularity among them."
"So I would stress that nothing I write here should be taken to mean we should *never, ever, ever* use any of these terms. The core argument comes down to that we should be evaluating why we are choosing one term over the other. This gets to the point that I have stressed at a few points about how translation isn't a neutral act. In the first, the decision whether to translate at all, and in the second, what term to translate to. There is absolutely value in using untranslated terms at points, but we shouldn't be using them blindly, and we should be considering *why* we prefer that, and what connotations come with it. 

The example I used elsewhere (takes out a dimension by not being a translation issue, just word choice) is the use 'Union Army' instead of 'American Army'. Even though the latter is entirely proper, the former is often preferred when writing about the Civil War, and how using one over the other inherently shifts perceptions. Many people have literally never even thought about the opposing forces in the context of the latter term! Neither term is *inherently* good or bad, but when writing on the topic we ought to be considering which one to use where, and what connotations the choice in use communicates.

Similarly, if we look at *panzer* and tank, there is points in both favors. As you note, it is something used at the time by the soldiers themselves (or alternatively ""Tiger"", although not always accurately so), but while that makes it sound authentic, does it mean it is the right word to use when writing about the history? I would say that is actually a great illustration of the why *not* for many situations, as it feeds into that same romantic impulse. 

Not to say the American soldiers *liked* the *panzers*, but they had a fearful respect for them, certainly, and that is one of the many connotations that gets wrapped up in the word. It marks out the *German* tanks in a way they certainly didn't fear an Italian one - or have reason to fear a Soviet one. The mystique of the *panzer* is one that has certain images in popular culture of the incredible German warmachines, but it also *doesn't* as easily carry with it the images of Tiger IIs breaking down every five miles due to bad suspension, or the myriad production issues with the Panthers. Does that mean you should never use *panzer*? Of course not, but it does mean you should think about *why* you are using it in a given spot, and what connotations you get from it in context, versus tank, or just giving the specific type of tank, or whatever other choice might suggest itself at the time."
"I don’t know if I’ve brought this up before, but seems like a good time to share: a couple summers ago I was interning at a regional theater that was going to produce *The Crucible* in the upcoming season, and I was tasked with doing what was essentially light (so to say, not super academic) dramaturgical research—research about the play’s history, subject matter, and themes—to help develop marketing strategies for the show. I’m honestly not sure what came out of that research, but I spent quite a bit of time scrolling through old /r/AskHistorians posts to find information about witch hunts, Salem, and McCarthyism that might be interesting and worth pursuing further. When I told my boss (who I think was vaguely familiar with the forum but not a follower) that I was using this place as a resource, he was certainly impressed, and probably a bit surprised. This was around the time that I was first transitioning from casual lurker to more active member around here.

"That was a particularly tricky and complex case, as I understand it. I believe the Austrian government instituted a process of restitution after WW2 which was limited in its scope, and which required surviving owners/their descendants who were now living outside Austria to 'donate' a portion of their rightful artworks to the Austrian state, in order to secure the relevant export permits. Given that most of the claimants were Jewish people who had fled abroad to escape the Holocaust, in practice the Austrian government were holding works to ransom. Maria Altmann, who was the surviving niece of Adele Bloch-Bauer, finally managed to secure her ownership of the painting by bringing a lawsuit in US jurisdiction, during which the Supreme Court asserted that there were circumstances in which a foreign state (i.e. Austria) could be sued by a US citizen."
"The Representation of the People Act of 1918 had not yet been passed when asylum would have been requested, and did not go into practice until the election that December, after Tsar Nicholas II had already been assassinated. 

This gave the vote to all men over 21, and certain women. Previously, the vote had only been for landowning men, but only those that fit fairly exact standards that purposefully excluded many of the Irish, Scottish, and poor landowners. 

Another modern standard may be women voting, which did not happen until the previous bill's follow-up, the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act of 1928.

Representation of the People Acts of 1948 and of 49 got rid of plural voting, which meant that you couldn't vote once for every property you owned. That was an antiquated technique for disenfranchising the poor which could be considered a roadblock to the term ""modern democracy.""

This is all not to mention that Britain ruled over a very large number of colonies at this time, and those subjects were not afforded the same rights, which may disqualify 1918 Britain from being a modern democracy."

If you're wondering what's in the removed comments, typically it's either one sentence answers based on quick googling (if that), people shitposting or wondering what happened to the removed comments. In this particular thread there are also few removed comments very briefly explaining that the third picture is from an animator's guild strike. 

All of these comments get removed on /r/AskHistorians because our readers want accurate, comprehensive, in-depth historical answers based on good historical practice and high-quality sources. While it's interesting that the third picture is from an animator's guild strike, we want an *in-depth* and *comprehensive* historical answer which also explains the first two pictures. 

It's amazing how many downvotes and reports an obvious shitpost can attract on a popular thread on /r/AskHistorians within minutes, thanks to our readers - if you see it, report it!

"It honestly astounds me how much Well’s work pops up when you start looking into 20th century technology. The one people usually talk about is how all of the major inventors of the rocket for the Nazis (later the US) and the Soviets were inspired by First Men in the Moon. That story even had a lot of predictions on the conditions of man landing on the moon correct, with the only exception being that Wells said that the astronauts would be inside a large ball that would be shot out of a humongous cannon."
"Unfortunately, I don't believe there is much evidence of her relationship with her father. While his third wife Jane Seymour did a lot for reconciling Henry VIII with his two children, Elizabeth was only three years old at her mother's execution. She was most definitely sheltered by people around her (especially Kat Astley, her governess) and learned early to ""toe the line"" and be nothing but respectful towards her father. Plus she had the example of how Mary was treated when she defied Henry VIII & refused to acknowledge his marriage to Anne and acquiesce to him being the head of the Church of England. She knew to keep to herself, not offer up her own opinion, and outwardly accept and practice whatever the current monarch was following/espousing at the moment as she knew her life depended on it--literally. She was incredibly intelligent and highly gifted in the art of verbal manipulation--often ministers in both Henry VIII and Mary's reigns tried to catch her out, but she could always see it coming a mile away. While she would always make her own decision in the end, she was more than willing to listen to her own ministers and trusted confidants to come to a (hopefully) correct and beneficial decision.

So, I think what you have to look at is her actions and sometimes flowery responses that actually say nothing to see how her relationship with her father (and later her sister) really was. Did she really, truly love them, like one loves a father or sister? I'm not confident we will know for sure. While she addressed both with the proper due respect their station commanded, she would always think out her replies with how it could possibly affect her in the long run, and if she couldn't commit to something she didn't believe in (like the Catholic religion) she would ask for someone to instruct her properly in order to buy herself time. Henry VIII and Mary were playing chess, Elizabeth played 3D chess."

"Contemporary fantasy settings in the *Dungeons & Dragons* mold generally falls under the ""quasi-medieval"" mindset. The *quasi* is important, because very few of these settings attempt strict historical accuracy, and a lot of the individual elements are often drawn from different periods of history...but there are some common elements. Gunpowder is usually absent, or at least not prominent; so combat is focused on melee weapons like swords and spears, and ranged weapons such as bows and crossbows. The feudal system is typically present, with a defined system of ranks of nobility and vassals. Industry and commercialism is usually limited, non-white Europeans are often absent, religious conflict rarely touched upon.

Which is to say, it doesn't look a lot like the period from late antiquity (c.5th century CE) to the early modern period (c.15th century CE) at all, which was generally a mess and marked by technological innovation, international trade, contact with other cultures (sometimes quite violent contact, but there you go), religious upheaval. But it bears obvious similarities to the courtly depiction of what the Middle Ages *should have been* like in chivalric romances like *Le Morte d'Arthur*, *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*; *chansons de geste* such as *The Song of Roland* and epics such as *Beowulf*, the *Nibelunglied*, and the *Eddas*.

If you look at [what was fantasy literature like before Tolkien](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9of58v/what_was_fantasy_literature_like_before_tolkien/e7tmfg5/), you can see this kind of approach as a mode in fantasy literature of the late 19th/early 20th century. As to why this quasi-medievalism appealed, I'm going to recycle an [earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7q7xoq/why_do_we_in_the_western_world_set_so_many_of_our/dsn3zyu/):

 I'm going to borrow from an expand on a previous answer a bit:

At the turn of the century, folks in the United States and United Kingdom expressed an interest in medievalism; it was a response to a number of different factors among all walks of life - increased literacy and publication of classics like *L'Morte d'Arthur* and *La Chanson de Roland*, medieval fairy tales aimed at children, class-based responses against increasing urbanization and industrialization of modern life, nouveau riche infatuation with symbols of traditional authority, military innovation and propaganda connected with World War I...

William Morris of the Arts and Crafts movement is a good starting point in many ways, because he was an important early figure in turn-of-the-century fantasy with his novels *The Well at the World's End* (1896), and his anti-industrial attitudes, the looking-back-on a medievalist setting with sort of rose-colored goggles had its echo in the works of Lord Dunsany, especially proto-Sword & Sorcery tales like ""The Fortress Unvanquishable Save for Sacnoth"" in *The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories* (1908) and eventually J. R. R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit* (1937) and *The Lord of the Rings* (1954-1955) - there are all authors who deliberately emphasized and ostracized the creep of industrialization, urbanization, and ""modern life,"" praising the simpler ideals and slower life of rural English life (and in so doing, all set some precedents for early environmentalism); corresponding to this slightly were authors like Arthur Machen, who borrowed aspects of medieval legend and romance in stories like ""The White People"" (1904) and ""The Bowmen"" (1914).

But you have to contrast this ""Romanticist"" movement with works like Mark Twain's *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court* (1889) and T. H. White's *The Once And Future King* (1958); these were no less fantastical, but much cynical (or if you like, humanist) in their portrayal of medieval life and society as something other than the ""knight in shining armor"" trope. And this reflected, to a degree, the real-life interest in the physical reality of medievalism. 

In Chris Bishop's [Medievalist Comics in the American Century](http://www.worldcat.org/title/medievalist-comics-and-the-american-century/oclc/948175902), he looks at the theme of ""medievalist"" comics - taking as particular examples of close study Prince Valiant, Green Arrow, Conan the Barbarian, etc. as American comics seized on these ""medieval"" archetypes of knights, archers, and swordsmen as heroes in the 20th century, and on page 29 he notes:

> By the time [William Randolph] Hearst had acquired the rights to publish *Prince Valiant*, he could already lay claim to a sizable collection of medieval objects. Hearst reputedly possessed the world's largest private collection of medieval armor, far outstripping his nearest rivals the industrialist Henry Ford and the banker Andrew Mellon.

Hearst was not interested in medievalism in the same way that Morris was - he was not casting back to a more romantic age as a refutation of industrialism, as much as he was enjoying the trappings of a traditional system whose elite status he had intruded upon with his new wealth. But it was a fascination with the trappings of the period that was shared across many different classes. For example, in Bashford Dean's [Helmets and Body Armor in Modern Warfare](https://books.google.com/books?id=8SvEBQAAQBAJ) - Dean was associated with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and was a noted collector and cataloguer of arms and armor; his book, published during WWI, shows clearly how contemporary minds were struggling to come to terms with the change in technology and tactics - trench warfare really being a throwback to siege warfare, swords rapidly obsolete as side-arms but still present (as were bayonets), and in this book Dean focuses on the design and effectiveness of personal body armor, helmets, and shields, noting their forebears in medieval forms. There, Dean noted that Ford was a notable manufacturer of helmets for World War I, and writes on page 212:

> Thus, in the summer of 1917, this helmet, after having been shown to the experts of several manufacturing concerns, who feared that it could not be made, was turned over to the Worcester Pressed Steel Company with directions to produce it in an experimental lot in 12 per cent manganese steel. Dies accordingly were prepared and every effort was made to deliver the helmets needed. Unfortunately, however, the dies which this firm employed were inadequately designed and in the end the only helmets produced were defective, having their sides wrinkled and their tops thinned out. Later, however, this helmet was shown to Messrs. Ford and Company of Detroit who declared that it could be pressed and pressed well without an important breakage of metal. Accordingly, this firm, received an order from the Ordnance Department, produced a set of experimental dies. On these, during the fall of 1918, a couple of thousand helmets were turned out. It may be mentioned that the principle upon which Messrs Ford and Company proceeded was quite similar to that which an armorer would have used in olden times, for the top of the helmet was pressed not as a final but as an earlier operation."

"Hiya,

I'm afraid after review we've had to remove this response. We have a number of concerns about the sources you've drawn upon for this response, particularly in that they are by and large badly dated. My understanding is that the arguments you present here are at odds with more recent scholarship. 

A few of our concerns here include that the characterisation of Landsknechts as ""middle class"" is far more contentious than is presented in your discussion, and it'd be great to expand more thoroughly on what you mean by that. In addition, your discussion of the wages earned by Landsknechts is, to our understanding, far from concrete, and stands at odds with the highly varied social and financial status of landsknecht during the period you discuss.

If you're able to elaborate more on your discussion with support from current scholarship, we'd be more than happy to reapprove it.

"Just as a  side note for the interested, gold has a density of 19.32 grams/cubic centimeter. That means that 10,000 lbs of gold, by volume, is about 8 1/3 cubic feet or 0.43 cubic meters.  So that may help give you a mental image of the amount of gold we are talking here.

">Would it be correct then to say they wanted the opposite of what happened, a more socialist economy maintained but an opening of society and democratic participation, I guess sorta similar to Dubček and the Prague spring.

No. The ""economically left"" faction of the post-Cultural Revolution CCP power structure had mostly dissipated since the (forced) resignation of Hua Guofeng in 1978. By the time of the 1986 student movement, fundamental disagreements between pro and anti-reform factions within the CCP were mostly along political rather than economic lines. 

In fact Hu Yaobang and Deng Xiaoping were close allies during the early years of Reform and Opening up, and Hu Yaobang maintained his support of Deng's economic reforms even up to the point of his political downfall.  Political disagreement between Hu Yaobang and the Party elders first became apparent when Hu proposed his **西藏六条** (""Six Articles of Reform for Tibet"") in 1980, in which Hu Yaobang proposed greater political and economic autonomy for Tibet. Hu subsequently also extended his ""Six Articles of Reform"" proposal to Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia as well. This triggered a significantly political backlash from the Party elders, and even from the military leadership (of which up to this point had mostly backed Hu Yaobang)."
Additional question: how 'common' was this practice? I have a hard time imagining the logistics of it. Was it really widespread or a PR thing?

"This question was actually asked - and at least partly answered - by an amateur historian named Elias Hillard in 1864. 

He found [at least 6 men who had fought in the Revolution and were alive during the Civil War](https://blogs.loc.gov/picturethis/2013/11/the-last-men-of-the-revolution/). He photographed and interviewed them, and published it all in a book called [*The Last Men of the Revolution*](https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg=05034062&searchType=1&permalink=y).

All 6 men were over 100, and you can read what Hillard wrote about each [here](http://www.americanrevolution.org/lastmen.php). It's fairly dense prose, in a mid-19th century style, but fundamentally each is an interview in much the same fashion as you might find today. 

This obviously isn't a full census, but I think it does answer the interview part of your question?"
"> did they have a solution (a local source of water I'm not aware of, or treating river water, etc)?

I've added it to my answer.

The city of Berlin took over municipal supply from individual consumers' wells in the 1870s, and shifted drawing water from the Spree River at Stralau, to plants above and below the city. West Berlin chiefly relied on groundwater processed at a (predictably completely separated from the East) water treatment plant. The rapid consumption of this water began to become a problem. Efforts to restore the level of groundwater were deemed successful by the 1980s.

"> I always thought that the space navy theme grew out of the idea that humans were seen as colonizing space, much the same way Europeans colonized the world using ships.

It wasn't always exactly on that line of thought; Gene Roddenberry, the creator of *Star Trek*, famously described the show as a ""wagon train to the stars"" - metaphors are sometimes taken literally by sci-fi writers, and sometimes not. Stories like ""The Struggle for Empire: A Story of the Year 2236"" by Cole mentioned above do definitely partake of the colonialist design, but it is essentially the projection of existing attitudes in a new direction, rather than a re-imagining of the realities of what space travel and space combat might look like. 

> Also as the Earth's surface is mostly water and space is mostly, well, space the parallels were too hard to ignore. It took months and even years to go from the Old World to the New World and the same would have applied to space, magnified by the mind-boggling distances of course.

As far as I can tell, that hasn't been a major influence. A lot of sci-fi doesn't go in for hard physics, so distances and speeds are handwaved quite a bit in favor of narrative action."

"Why *Ming*, specifically?

A European fascination with white-with-blue porcelain is apparent in the early 16th century. By the 17th, it had become a hot commodity among the nobility and royalty of western Europe. The merchants of the expanding overseas trade, particularly the Dutch East India Company, found porcelain importing a lucrative prospect, and began importing it in bulk in the mid-17th century.

Well, the Chinese sure picked up on this trend--and started mass-producing porcelain *specifically* for export to Europe. That didn't just mean ""make more""--it actually meant *make European designs*. Family coats of arms were very popular (you could order custom Chinese porcelain! In 1780!), but so were illustrations of biblical scenes and European animals. The types of porcelain produced were also very much to European tastes--cup and saucer, jiving with the growing tea culture. That is to say, it was *functional*, fancy and special but still useful and used.

So basically, there are loads and loads of white-with-blue porcelain hanging out in the Netherlands. When English, particularly, collectors and purveyors of Exotic Things add Chinese porcelain to Japanese lacquered furniture and Indian peacock feathers in their arsenal of things that look gorgeous and exotic and *rich* to display, the porcelain is actually the most accessible. Snappy English merchants didn't have to get it from China, they just ported it across from the Netherlands! (And then the Chinese picked up on the 19th century trend, and started manufacturing even *more* cheap stuff for export.)

But--this is from the mid-17th century onward, and is Westernized in flavor. The Ming-Qing breaking point? Early 17th century. Ming, specifically, ceramics thus had two things going for them that were crucial to the later Victorian insatiability for prestige collecting: they were rare (in comparison to the Qing porcelain flooding in from the Netherlands) and perceived as exotic, featuring Chinese trends in decoration instead of European ones. When the middle classes could participate in the lure of 'the Orient' through the purchase of cheap European knockoffs or modern Chinese variants, the rich simply upped the ante: not just Chinese ceramics, but *Ming*.

Jacqueline Yallop's *Magpies, Squirrels, and Thieves: How the Victorians Collected the World* is a really fun overview of Victorian prestige collecting.

They see the original media as the original experience (even though it is probably very degraded by now and not presented in its original context).

"> novice homos

I presume you mean *novi homines*? In which case *novi homines* were not a problem. A *novus homo* is, depending on precisely how we define it, an individual either holding senatorial magistracy or specifically the consulship for the first time in his family line. Few (if any) of the extraordinary careers in the wake of the Second Punic War were undertaken by *novi homines*.

The purpose of the *lex Vilia* seems to have been to establish more precisely the requirements for senatorial magistracy. It apparently supplanted an earlier *lex Baebia* mentioned by Livy, the only provisions of which that we know for fact seem to have been the establishment of regular praetorian elections and some sort of regulation on *ambitus*. Laws regulating the *cursus honorum* generally reduced the influence of individual reputations on elections, by limiting the degree to which politicians could capitalize consecutively on great state works and deeds, and established more clearly the qualifications needed to enter into certain levels of a political career. Previously the *cursus honorum* had been regulated almost entirely by tradition, and even after the *lex Vilia* the rules could be bent on occasion. Establishment of clear provisions could reduce the chances of abuse of the system. If individuals had to follow certain steps and wait for certain ages cases in which great generals or statesmen like Scipio suddenly catapulted themselves into the upper echelons of their careers could be avoided. Even though Scipio followed the ordinary (if not traditional) laws of political advancement at the time, his career was not normal, and he exercised a truly magnificent degree of power throughout the rest of his career. While the Roman *nobiles* were extraordinarily competitive they simultaneously and almost paradoxically considered anyone who rose to preeminence and stayed there with immense suspicion. Apart from the possibility of an unqualified man attaining a great position by accident of circumstance, such laws helped prevent such anxieties of reputation and influence, by ensuring that at least nominally everybody was on the same playing field"
"  he older answers cited below are good, I might add a couple of thoughts from an archaeological perspective. The short answer is that the Inka did not need currency to operate or expand. There were items like finely-woven textiles and Spondylus ornaments that probably had convertible value, and were often given by elites to other elites, but were not really money. La Lone (1994) once described the Inka economy as “supply on demand”- or one that met institutional goals rather than the motivations of a market economy.

The Inka state functioned by what we (most historians and archaeologists) understand to long-standing cultural conventions related to reciprocity. This study relates to a larger body of literature in economic anthropology (among other specializations) that study the ideas related to “gifts”, particularly how they create obligations to give, to receive, and to repay, sometimes in the absence of (or in spite of) a monetary system.  

The Quechua word (one of the most common languages spoken within the Inka empire) is *ayni*, which implies that when people are give something, they are entitled to receive of comparable value back (i.e., balanced reciprocity). So a common situation is that various community members might help a family till a potato field and, at a later date, that family might then later help various people sheer and store their llama wool. These obligations are often phrased in the language of kinship, relatives being expected to help other relatives. This turn taking is sometimes called *mit’a* in Quechua and is still practiced across many highland portions of the Central Andes. One of my favorite books that beautifully details the subject (among others) is *The Articulated Peasant* by Enrique Mayer.

The Inka were among the last in a long line of indigenous polities that interacted with local populations using familiar idioms of kinship to appropriate people’s labor and resources (see Silverblatt 1988). There were several different taxes and obligations, the most relevant is one called *mit’a* service, levied on able-bodied males. Mit’a service was usually scheduled to coincide with agricultural downtime and included a range of activities from construction projects to military service.  This helped the Inka commission the building of road networks, large estates, and conquer or reclaim lots of new agricultural land. The latter is quite critical, as the Inka would commission the building of many terraced fields, and the agricultural resources of these fields was reserved for the Inka state. In some cases, the Inka would relocate entire populations (called mitmaqkuna settlers) to work on newly claimed lands. These agrarian staples would be stored in storehouses called qollqa, and reserves used to support the Inka themselves, other laborers, the military, etc., and the Inka kept a careful accounting of their resources using khipu (for an example, read Urton and Chu 2015).

The Inka, in turn, were expected to repay local communities for their labor. They did so in several ways, including displays of hospitality and generosity. Organizing festivities- replete with food and beverage- for the commoners was frequent. The archaeological site of Huanaco Pampa is a good case study. This was a large architectural site surrounded by qollqas, but most of the pottery was related to the brewing and serving of corn beer (*chicha*)- suggesting it was the site that helped to provision or host these festivals (Morris and Edwards 1985).

The advantage of mit’a labor taxation (called corvée labor elsewhere) is that, in theory, it doesn’t require people to give the state their own agricultural resources. Giving the state, say, 10% of your food or money in a lean year but be the difference between life and death. But giving the state a month of work during the time that doesn’t interfere with the planting, harvesting, canal cleaning, etc., tasks avoids this problem. By claiming or reclaiming land that wasn’t being used (again, in theory), the Inka allowed (friendly) people to keep their ancestral fields in return for their labor. Their labor would simply be directed toward securing new sources of food, corn beer, textiles, and other supplies for the state.

An early Inka historian, Cobo (1979: 234), wrote, “One thing that should be pointed out with respect to the amount of tribute that they brought to the king, and it is that there was no other rate or limit, either of the people that the provinces gave for the mita labor service or in other requirements, except the will of the Inca. The people were never asked to make a fixed contribution of anything, byt all of the people needed were called for aforementioned jobs, sometimes in larger numbers, according to the Inca’s desire...”

Murra (1980) discusses how labor taxation was probably changing by the time of Spanish contact, but that is a different subject. If you would like to read about the Inka in more detail, my recommendation is D’Altroy’s recent book *The Incas*, which shows all the signs of being a new gold standard in the archaeology of the region.

Hope this helps some. To sum up, the Inka didn’t develop from a tradition that used money as we know it, and instead relied upon taxing people’s labor rather than their wealth to realize their imperial ambitions.

"Before I start, I'd like to offer up a recent paper that Pow contributed to: [Contextualizing the Mongol Invasion of Hungary in 1241-42: Short-and Long-Term Perspectives](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329573862_Contextualizing_the_Mongol_Invasion_of_Hungary_in_1241-42_Short-and_Long-Term_Perspectives). It offers a much more nuanced view of the Hungarian withdrawal, accepting the contribution of the short term climated factor (although rejecting it is the causal factor) to the withdrawal and suggesting that it was the strong resistance of the Hungarians following Mohi that stalled the Mongols and caused them to retreat in order to regroup. It's well worth a read, and I'm going to refer to it a few times in my answer.

In spite of claims to the contrary, horse nomads have frequently had success against fortified cities. Attila the Hun, in the fifth century AD, sacked a number of fortified Roman towns and very nearly succeeded in taking the major city of Orleans. If Aetius and Thorismund hadn't either attacked Attila during the finale assault or caused him to leave after breaching the walls from their close presence, the town would surely have fallen. The walls of these towns were usually a little over 3 meters thick and 7 meters high, so they were not small obstacles for Attila to tear down.

The Avars had similar successes in their brief period of power, reducing Sirmium, Marcianopolis (a previous victim of Attila), Kabile and several other fortified towns. The Bulgars had similar success, as have many other tribes over the years to one degree or another. Importantly, the nomads who have had the most success are those who have deliberately organised themselves along the lines of a state (or at least a proto-state) and either hired or forced enemy engineers to construct the siege equipment. Once this is achieved, it's a matter of preparing the assault - usually by breaching the wall with a mine or a battering ram - or simply waiting and starving the enemy population into surrender.

The Mongols were really no different. In fact, despite the help they received from Chinese engineers and rival states, their achievements are pretty impressive. Chinese cities had incredibly impressive defenses compared to European towns. The largest of the Theodosian Walls at Constantinople, for instance, varies between 4.5m and 6m at the base and is 12m high, while early 13th century French town fortifications consisted of a ditch 12-19m wide and walls 6-10m high and 1.2-2.1m thick. These were sufficient even for early counterweight trebuchets, but pale in comparison to the walls of a Chinese city like Kaifeng, with a moat that was slightly over 30 meters wide and walls that were a little over 18 meters wide at the base and 12 meters high. While not an average city, the defenses were certainly larger than typical European equivalents.

It's no wonder than the Mongols rarely managed to physically assault and capture a major Chinese city of this scale, but what can't be forgotten is that they *were* capable of taking smaller fortifications. As the disastrous 1258-1259, the Mongols had the means and the will power to systematically reduce well sited, well stocked fortifications even when disease, weather and supply difficulties resulted in heavy casualties. They proved this in Korea as well, launching invasion after invasion, slowly wearing the country down until it finally surrendered.

And, of course, we the have the Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire. Otrar held out for five months, Nishapur took several days to reduce and, while Samarkand might have fallen in less than a week, it required serious preparation and urban fighting to finally destroy the city. While the towns which fell after only a couple of days may seem to support Pow's idea that the mud brick walls were the main weakness - although the evidence, both written sources and experimental archaeology, does *not* support his idea that the siege engines destroyed the walls - similarly quick assaults are recorded by the Huns and Avars.

The key, then, is Otrar. It lasted so long for two reasons: 1) it was well garrisoned and 2) the defenders were determined to hold out until the bitter end. Having sufficient trained soldiers to man the walls and beat off any attempts to fill the ditch or mine the walls is an enormous benefit, and large numbers of soldiers also allow for the active defence (sorties and the like) that Persian sources record. Additionally, motivated soldiers are far more likely to risk their lives and defend the town than those without much motivation.

That brings us back around to Hungary and why the Mongols didn't destroy the stone castles there. The simple answer is that the probably didn't particularly want to. When they had reason to attack, such as at the fortress of Klis, position, defences or casualties didn't deter them - finding out that King Bela IV wasn't within the castle did. Similarly, the abbey of Pannonhalma might have held out against the Mongols, but sustained heavy damage as well and likely only survived because the force besieging it was recalled as part of the general retreat. Clearly, the Mongols were willing to commit to a siege when it was deemed necessary.

In general, however, the Mongols don't appear to have had much interest in sieges on the eastern side of the Danube. They did prosecute a couple of sieges using civilian conscripts, notably at the fortified refuge of Pereg (whose earth and timber defenses were overcome once the moat was filled), the monastery at Igris (which surrendered after it became clear they could not, in spite of stone walls, hold out) and at Estergrom (where even stone palaces didn't save the inhabitants of the town), but they seems to have avoided any siege that would require a significant investment of time. This is not the same as being unable to complete the siege.

Additional evidence comes to us in the form of the Mongol behaviour once they managed to cross the Danube. Whereas they had spread out all across the Great Hungarian Plain, laying waste to everything in their past they could easily destroy, once they got across the Danube, there is very little evidence of the presence at all. As the paper I linked to at the start points out, the Mongol behaviour on the west of the Danube is completely different from the East.

This, I think, has less to do with the fortifications than it does with the Mongol's near loss at Mohi, which both European and Chinese sources say badly shook Batu and nearly caused him to retreat. Bela IV had assembled new forces, and now many of his nobles were no longer rebelling against him. The Mongols face, if not a fresh force, then still a sizeable force of the kind that, as far as they knew, was the same as had come within a hair of beating them at Mohi. This naturally made then cautious, as being on the actual losing end did to the Hungarians. The result was, apart from some cat-and-mouse chasing of Bela IV, a very cautious campaign of siege and shadowing.

Ultimately, the Mongols withdrew. We don't know why for sure, and we probably never will. However, it was likely a combination of factors, including Bela IV's escape, the risk of another major battle with the Hungarians - possibly reinforced from Germany - and lack of fodder for the horses. The west of the Danube is far less conducive to large herds of horses, sheep and cattle and, while not an insurmountable problem, was probably one that the Mongols didn't need at that particular time. Political motivations may have played a role in the Mongol withdrawal, and they almost certainly played a role on the Mongols staying away. The situation really wasn't stable enough to get involved in a war that might take another twenty years, and ultimately never quite managed to get back to the right level of a massive offensive into the West.

As a final note, the 1285 invasion was stopped at the Danube, just where the first invasion was halted for ten months. This wasn't because of new stone castles - most of these were facing the Holy Roman Empire (the *real* threat) - but because the Danube is a bloody big river and the Hungarians actively defended it. And, not having previously engaged in a pitched battle, they were able to pick their moment and nearly wipe out one of the invading Mongol forces. Those stone castles or towns with stone defences did survive quite well, but in this case it's even less clear why the Mongols invaded and whether it was an invasion or merely a raid on a large scale.

So, to sum up, could the Mongols take Western castles? Yes, absolutely. None of them were particularly impressive compared to Chinese fortifications, and medieval European towns and cities were even less impressive. The limiting factor seems to have been the combination of the desire to conquer and the political will to do it, even though it would take many resources and several decades at least. This combination doesn't really seem to have stuck around after the first half of the 13th century and, as a result, Europe seems to have escaped conquest by not being attractive enough of a target."
"This is probably unfeasible, but what if a list is created of all the different tags, and a random assortment of 10 or more tags that were chosen are displayed in a stickied post every week, with a day out of the week dedicated to ""random history topics"" to encourage a diversity of questions? This is not a knock on anyone, but many people probably lack the broadness of history knowledge to know what they might not know, a prerequisite of asking a history question. By having the specific random history topics, people with light more specific knowledge on a subject may be more incentivized to ask more specific questions about less well known aspect of history, and potentially creating a base of superficial knowledge that encourages a diversity of questions."
"Great answer! I have a follow up  question. Are there any asian/eastern sources on Polo? If he was a governor of a city, or so close an associate to the Great Khan's administration, and a European at that, he must be mentioned somewhere even in passing."
"Well, the elites weren't that monolithic. But I think the honest answer is that a shift didn't happen. The Democrats have dominated the urban centers of the United States pretty much from the beginning. The Democratic Party of 1860, including the part of it that formed the Confederacy, has a fair bit of ideological and demographic continuity to today. (To be fair, it *also* has organizational continuity with the War Democrats who supported the Republicans in ending the Confederacy.)

For example, the Democrats have a history of being hostile to finance capitalism and corporations. One of the *founding issues* of the Democratic Party in 1828 was opposition to corporate influence in politics. During Redemption and the imposition of Jim Crow, the Southern Democrats *banned corporations* in several of their states. The Southern Democrats talked about stock marketers and bankers as speculators and parasites. You can see a pretty clear ideological through line there.

Likewise, working class urban whites have largely been Democrats for the entire history of the Republic while low church or evangelical whites have largely been Whigs or Republicans. These same patterns showed up in the 2020 election.

So insofar as ""liberalism"" means pro-labor, anti-corporate politics and the idea of limited religious influence in public life, the pro-slavery elites and urbanites *were* liberal. Insofar as ""conservative"" means religious influence in public life and pro-corporate politics, the anti-slavery Republicans *were* conservative. The parties have had some ideological changes since then, most notably the Democrats shed most of their pro-segregation ideology between 1960 and 2000. But it wasn't a discontinuity.  It was the same people shifting a specific portion of their ideology, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly and painfully.

History is not a simple right vs left, good vs evil narrative. Remember, the same Republican Party that won the Civil War also created the Gilded Age. And the Gilded Age was also the first era where you saw Black Senators and the only Black majority state government in US history. The Progressive Era meanwhile saw a huge growth in regulation... and those regulations included Jim Crow. The same apparatus used to ensure businesses didn't exploit their workers gave the state the capacity it needed to make sure that the same businesses didn't serve Black customers. History is fascinating but it's very rarely a simple dualistic narrative."

"I find it a bit odd that neither answer actually refers to what Cicero has to say about his house:

>>I bought that very house for three and a half million sesterces a little after your congratulations. And so now you may realize that I have so much debt that I'd like to join a conspiracy, if anyone would have me.

Cicero then goes on to joke that all the would-be conspirators he can find shut the door in his face on account of his treatment of the Catilinarians. But the comment is also supposed to be a jab at the money-lenders, whom Cicero defended in 63 against the threat of Catilinarian tabulae novae and who, Cicero jokes, find it unbelievable that anyone can be short of cash after Cicero's important measures to free up cash reserves in 63. 

The place to look is Frederiksen, ""Caesar, Cicero and the Problem of Debt."" An old article, but the classic study, and much less focused on the precise logistics of moneylending and more on the social implications of it, which in the balance is probably more important"
"Of course not, from my understanding (it’s a bit difficult to say, as significant attempts were made to erase the memory of Zheng He by Imperial scholars), his fleet simply was left to rot, it may have been used for small expeditions in South-East Asia, but most historians agree that it’s unlikely that any other voyages on the scale of Zheng’s were undertaken after his death during his seventh and final voyage. Zheng He began to fall out of favour with the successors to the Yongle Emperor, so that when Zheng died there were attempts to erase Zheng and his voyages from the official Imperial records, thus it is likely that his fleet was forgotten about due to political machinations. This explains why Zheng’s voyages have only been re-discovered relatively recently. Also, the Ming empire began to face a lot of trouble on their Northern, Mongolian border which resulted in several expensive military expeditions, so it’s likely that there simply wasn’t money to spare for maintaining the fleet or outfitting any other expeditions."

"To be fair, literally every US President has said, in effect, ""nothing was off the table."" Every President has rejected a ""No First Use"" policy and implied that, however _deep_ back on the table they might be, nukes are there somewhere. It's just that when someone people think are hawkish says it, they think it's a threat, but when someone more dovish says it (or more or less the same thing), they are willing to say, ""well, of course you have to keep them _somewhere_ as a form of deterrence, even for certain types of non-nuclear attacks."" Officially NFU has been rejected because the US doesn't want to constrain itself especially in respects to other forms of WMD and even other potentially non-WMD-but-really-awful sorts of activities. Keeping that line blurry is meant to make potential enemies think twice even without using nukes themselves. But there have been different emphases — e.g., the Obama administration has never adopted NFU but its official doctrine has emphasized the importance of maintaining the taboo.

As for Saddam — the details aren't my ken, but apparently as part of the compilation of the Duelfer report many interviews, documents, etc., were acquired that discuss these matters. I was part of a very long seminar on deterrence and Iraq in 2013 at the Wilson Center in DC that discussed this. I cannot quite remember (or reconstruct) from my notes which paper discussed this in general (a ""not for distribution"" summary notes it as being something that was discussed generally by the room). Also, I see from my notes that the consensus was, by then, that Saddam had not himself ordered the fires set (it's somewhat more complex than that), but did believe that the US was likely to use nuclear weapons against Baghdad. Apparently part of his belief was based on the erroneous idea that the US had used chemical weapons in Vietnam, weirdly enough. 

In deterrence theory, for deterrence to fail there needs to be a credible commitment by the deterring party — if you do X, I'll do Y, but if you don't do X, I won't do Y — which to my knowledge in nuclear matters has always held. The Iraq case is interesting because they perceived commitment that was not actually being made by the USA. There are many non-nuclear examples though. The Falklands war is often cited as one — Argentina thought it could call the UK's bluff. 

As for whether it can fail — it can definitely fail. Nobody doubts that. All you need is misunderstanding, miscommunication, miscalculation, etc. There were several cases when it nearly failed in the nuclear case (1962 and 1983 are usually cited as the ""closest calls"" for that, when it would have taken only a little nudge to fail). This is why a lot of people don't like having to put faith in deterrence, and why it is usually seen as a good thing to avoid brinksmanship, testing the limits, unnecessarily tense situations where mistakes can make for bad outcomes, etc. The issue of course is that if you say, ""I don't want to rely on deterrence,"" what are you left with? Usually the people who make a big deal about not relying on deterrence are in favor of total abolition of nuclear arms, but not all that much else is offered up. What the arms theorists do, more or less, is try and figure out how to make sure that the deterrent threat is big enough to prevent bad things from seeming like good ideas, and looking for ways to avoid tripping over the line (e.g., after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the ""hotline"" was installed connecting Moscow and DC, so that communication could be done much more easily in a time of crisis). 

Ultimately deterrence relies on states and their leaders behaving rationally with good information. We have enough experience in the study of human history (recent and old) to know that this is not a guaranteed. "
"Thank you very much for this explanation!  I find it fascinating that ground avoidance games have been around for so long, but weren't always associated with lava.  Is there any information about when lava became a mainstream trope in stories and literature?  Today lava is a (fairly) common hazard in video games, movies, books and other media.  Did the press cover some eruption in the early or mid 20th century that might have raised awareness of lava?  Or maybe some pirate or adventure story that had a genre defining scene of an active volcano?"
"What a wonderful answer, thank you! As a follow up: Do you happen to know what, if any, role gossip might play in the assembly proceedings? Let’s say a neighbor who dislikes you for some particular reason happens to remember a time he heard that you tried to flirt with the dead man’s wife. Would this play a part? Would there be a back and forth on the question of flirtation and whether or not the neighbor or other gossip sources can be trusted?

Of course line between information/witnesses and gossip might be a false one itself."

First, re: Foucault -- I was a little snarky, but the mods are correct; no one should rely on Foucault as a reliable primary (or even secondary) source. However, in this particular domain (the Paris Clinical School) it's impossible to escape his influence, and he's quoted in every piece of scholarship I've ever read about that period. Personally, I'm less interested in Foucault's historiography (which, to be fair to the man, is about as advanced as my own -- that is, read a bunch of things doctors wrote) than in his intellectual framework. Along with Kuhn, his influence is hard to avoid in the history and philosophy of science.

&#x200B;

Second: one reason I'm so passionate about this subject is its relevance to my day job -- practicing medicine. You can practice medicine while being ignorant of medical history -- most doctors do that every day. There are some who would argue that it's a good thing; after all, can't you be a practicing chemist without reading old treatises on phlogiston? But medicine is not a science (or at least, it isn't totally a science); it's a cultural practice tied up in centuries of assumptions and tradition. Developing an historical perspective, I feel, helps doctors realize and address some of the unconscious assumptions and biases we have today.

Thank you so much!  This is exactly what I was looking for.
"Just so we're clear in advance: [this is Rosemary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_Kennedy#/media/File:Rosemary_Kennedy_at_Court.jpg), making her debut at the English royal court.

In point of fact, none of the immediate Kennedy family expressed public remorse/criticism for inflicting the lobotomy on Rosemary--at least not directly. Now, whether they all believed it was the *right* thing to do, whether they believed it was the *utilitarian* thing to do, and whether they *indirectly* expressed a sense of failure or anger--that is, shall we say, a rather nebulous topic in biographies of the various Kennedys.

One camp, headlined subtly by Doris Kearns Goodwin and like a sledgehammer by Laurence Leamer at the two poles of the spectrum, sees in Joseph's actions after the 1941 ""surgery"" a man seeking solace (Goodwin) or who understood he had committed a major sin (Leamer). Joseph initially placed Rosemary at a rehab/care facility called Craig House that had an excellent reputation and charged the fees to back it up. Joseph's biographer (and actual professional historian) David Nasaw shows on the basis of letters sent to family members that Joseph most likely visited Rosemary several times over the course of the 1940s, although it became horribly clear she would regain any more of what had been wrenched away from her than some motor skills. Joseph's words to his family are noncomittal--""looks very well"" ""feeling quite well."" In 1949, probably owning up to the long-term prognosis, he arranged a special place for her at an institution/""school"" in Wisconsin run by Franciscan Colettine nuns. As in, he gave *buckets* of money to the place for special accommodations for her. 

Of course, while Joseph was doing all of this, he was keeping his family away from visiting Rosemary themselves, and misleading them about the shockingly awful lobotomy results. Whether he was trying to insulate himself from his wife Rose's wrath, or protect his family from seeing what he'd done, OR protect his family from seeing that what he perceived as a last-ditch attempt to help her had still failed, is left to question.

For his part, Nasaw, whose take is generally considered among the most equitable, refuses to make a judgment call on whether Joseph believed he had done the wrong thing. But although he won't go as far to paint Joseph as a father with at least *some* sorrowful feelings for his daughter as Goodwin, she is much more brutal about the effect this had on Rose. She tells the story of Rose asking her friends over and over, ""Why didn't you tell me?"" only for her friends to say, ""we didn't know either."" In her memoirs, she wrote:

> The operation eliminated the violence and the convulsive seizures, but it also had the effect of leaving Rosemary permanently incapacitated. She lost everything that had been gained during the years by her own gallant efforts and by our loving efforts for her. She had no possibility of ever being able to function in a viable way in the world at large.

I'm not sure how this is not generally accounted a direct attack on Joseph's decision, but it does not seem to be? But then, this may be a pattern. There is one letter where Joseph comments more extensively on Rosemary's existence in the world, rather than breezy mentions of doing well. In 1958, he wrote to the nuns of St. Coletta's expressing his deep gratitude for their ""persevering kindness"" towards Rosemary. And pretty much every writer quotes the same lines:

> I am still very grateful for your help. After all, the solution to Rosemary's problem has been a major factor in the ability of all the Kennedys to go about their life's work and to try to do it as well as they can.

Nasaw offers zero commentary; Goodwin suggests he is expressing sorrow for the outcome, and maybe or maybe not the decision. Disability rights advocates, on the other hand, have pointedly asked, ""Is Rosemary not 'all the Kennedys'?"" And in Joseph's words, they find him saying that isolating Rosemary in Wisconsin, away from the world's knowledge and from her own family, was the only way that the rest of them could be successful. That is to say: people with cognitive disabilities are a problem to be solved, and to be solved by exclusion.

Of course, the rest of the Kennedys went on to champion mental health services and services for people with cognitive disabilities on the national and even international scale. Rose Kennedy was orchestrating donations for child neurology research through the Kennedy Foundation into the 2000s--and, for whatever bitterness she held, ensuring that things with a name attached would memorialize Joseph as well as herself. Jack signed a series of mental health services bills into law; while they ultimately resulted in massively inadequate care for a lot of people when the requires facilities were never built (a failure of money and a crime of NIMBYism), Senator Daniel Moynihan suggested that Jack would have *flipped tables* in the White House if he thought people like his sister would not be taken care of. Eunice Kennedy Shriver's activism in creating an arena for social life and growth in the Special Olympics I've discussed elsewhere in the thread. Ted Kennedy was pushing for mental health insurance coverage parity until the end of his life. And people generally agree that the Kennedys did a lot to raise awareness of the actual, real existence of people with cognitive disabilities and mental health disorders--and more to the point, of starting to crack the stigma on talking about them in the first place.

They shouldn't get all the credit. The 1950s saw mothers (and some fathers, but mostly mothers) of children with Down's syndrome banding together in parents' groups--ARC is founded in 1951--and did a lot to cast off the idea that a diagnosis of developmental disability was *the absolute end* for the togetherness of the family. On the other hand, you can't argue with the impact of the visibility--and pocketbooks--of the Kennedys.

I'm not a cynic who sees the other Kennedys ""using"" Rosemary as a platform, or rather, of ""taking advantage"" of her. Nevertheless, I have to wonder why--in the face of all the crusading--Rosemary herself was never allowed a presence. The lobotomy destroyed the person she had been...but there are all kind of people at all levels of cognitive ability in America. So I think it's a real question that both historians assessing the situation and disability rights advocates have to ask: were they (and hence, people in a similar situation) keeping Rosemary out of sight because of guilt, shame, unwillingness to criticize the family patriarch? Or did they conclude based on what they knew of Rosemary's own thoughts and hopes, rather than their own, what *she* would have preferred...had she only been able to voice them herself?

"Great question! Ancient Egyptians did wear more than loincloths in the winter and during the cold nights. Some paintings and decorative art on ancient artifacts does in fact show Egyptians wearing long dresses, long pants similar to leggings, and many variations of cloaks and wraps.

Linen and wool were the primary fabrics before cotton cloth was invented. The key to understanding how they kept warm during the cold nights and were able to deal with such extremes of temperature is the concept of layering. Layers of linen covered with a top layer of wool is much warmer than it may sound. Silk was also used in the Ptolemaic period but I don't know much about this and perhaps others can shed light on how early this material was used and what kinds of garments?

One interesting factor not always obvious from the more famous pieces of artwork the general public may be more familiar with, is the possibility that a thin pant similar to modern-day leggings were frequently worn during cold weather, and especially by soldiers in ancient times. We only have physical evidence of this sort of garment as early as the 7th century but there are hints of these garments in ancient artwork.

There is no evidence that (very real) climate change or longterm cyclical weather changes has had such a dramatic effect that would indicate Ancient Egypt was much hotter than current day. If anything, data seems to support the opposite given rising temperatures in the desert.

Another consideration is that the artwork (like today's artwork especially commercial types like photographs in advertisements or dress worn by characters in television and film) often showed an idealized or more fashionable version of dress. Women were shown wearing tight and more sexually appealing clothes while in reality the average commoner was wearing a long loose-fitting gown, perhaps similar to modern day traditional jalabiya (جلابيات).

Capes and shawls were also very important to Egyptian culture and fashion and indeed many examples can be found in artwork.

"The model used by the landsknecht involved most or all of the logistical concerns being shouldered by a subcontractor. In other words, a captain would be given a lump sum of money and then it would be his responsibility to ensure that his men were trained, armed, clothed, fed and paid. How exactly he went about this was generally up to him. Sometimes, like sunagainstgold mentions, captains could simply require recruits bring their own arms, other times they might work out a deal with a supplier and then subtract the equipment costs from the recruit's pay.

In general, one of the advantages of hiring swiss or german mercenaries was that, in addition to bringing a lot of experience, they were more likely to be equipped and trained with state of the art pikes and arquebuses. This made them especially appealing in places like France or England where traditional levies and militias still fought more or less the same way their grandfathers had."

Thank you for such a detailed and well researched answer!
"I am not very knowledgeable about Argentina but as a Venezuelan that's currently researching my country's history in depth, in particular economic history, I may be able to answer about it.

To understand Venezuela, you must understand its oil industry. By the turn of the 20th century, Venezuela was politically unstable and heavily indebted. A civil war and skirmishes with local *caudillos* made the country a hot mess to rule over, and political and economical growth was going slowly.

Enter Juan Vicente Gomez. Second-in-command for President Cipriano Castro, he seized power from him in 1908 as the latter went abroad for surgery. And until his death in 1935, he oversaw the change from a crop-based economy to an oil-exporting one, and it would remain as such till today. He was the first one to direct the oil revenues to modernization and infrastructure development, while taking a large cut for himself and his cronies. The concession-based model for mining and oil extraction that would last until the 1970s, along with minuscule taxation, allowed the foreign companies to take abroad most of the profits from the oil.

Although the Natives and Spaniards knew about the presence of oil beneath the surface thanks to oil seeps, industrial drilling did not take place until the 1910s, due to an increased demand from industrialization and the advent of the internal combustion engine. And in 1922, the oil well Barroso II blew out, spewing a hundred thousand barrels of oil per day for nine days into the air, which was a wonderful PR move by the oil to announce its bountiful presence, and a beacon for foreign companies (i.e. Shell, Esso, British Petroleum) to start large-scale drilling and, soon, refining. In less than a decade, Venezuela would become the third largest oil producer, and largest exporter, in the world.

As mentioned before, the State did not really partake on this bonanza, making most of its income by selling concessions to drill. Political pressures towards democracy and a fair share of the revenues had to wait until Gomez's death in 1935. The country began a slow transition towards democracy and in 1943, it was codified into Law that the State would receive half of the profits from the oil industry. An even bigger share meant larger projects, and with the advent of the first truly democratic government of Romulo Gallegos in 1948, the country was already planning or working on massive public projects: [Caracas' University City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_City_of_Caracas), [housing and government offices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tczq1mvStU0), [industrial development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPSm9cA5tGA), [bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Rafael_Urdaneta_Bridge)...

Around this time, a military government by Marcos Perez Jimenez took hold, ruling between 1952-1958. Oil revenue was essentially unchanged, but modernization and development became a matter of prestige and national security. Also around this time, there was a serious discussion on what to do with the oil revenue. Ultimately the ""Sowing the Oil"" concept, developed by Arturo Uslar Pietri, dominated. That means that the best way to invest the oil revenue was to invest in the people and the country; via the aforementioned massive public projects but also funding public education, healthcare, and culture, as well as working to export refined goods and not crude oil, and invest on other industries (most notably steel).

By 1961, with democracy properly restored, the country was prosperous. ~~A few years before, the Venezuelan Bolivar was the highest valued currency in the world.~~ ^^1 A welfare state was in place, ensuring the oil revenues were distributed among the people. Politically, a two-party system took hold, which did not allow for much change. And collusion between the parties, as well as the ridiculous amount of state revenue, allowed corruption and inefficiency to flourish. But as long as the oil kept flowing, this could be maintained, and the people were happy.

In 1976, oil was fully nationalized, and PDVSA, the State's oil company, began operations. Venezuela was known at this time as the ""Saudi Venezuela"", with a high quality of life and an enviable position in Latin America. But shortly thereafter, in the 1980s oil glut, coupled with mismanagement, inefficiency, and corruption, as well as a political desire to keep the welfare state in place, led to bad fiscal and economic policies such as devaluing and fixing an exchange price for the Bolivar and ballooning public debt. The system was unsustainable, and the situation worsened until the nation required a bailout from the IMF. This proved wildly unpopular, and led to [massive protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracazo), [two coup attempts and an impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_presidency_of_Carlos_Andr%C3%A9s_P%C3%A9rez) and, ultimately, inflation and worsening economic conditions that led to the rise of Hugo Chavez in 1998.

This basically covers 20th century Venezuela. I highly recommend watching the three-part [El Reventon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s55LNl_Q3U4) documentary about the Venezuelan oil history, if you can find it in English. For a more general Latin American woes, including Argentina, [Open Veins of Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Veins_of_Latin_America) is great for history, but... iffy on economic theory. For a more economic view, [Guide for the Perfect Latin American Idiot](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Perfect-Latin-American-Idiot/dp/156833236X) is a direct counter for the economic theory on that book, and I believe the two ought to be read together.

Suffice to say he pushes an outdated and poorly supported narrative of medieval backwardness, squalor, ignorance, etc that is completely absent of both nuance and academic rigor. The below quote should be taken as illustrative of the problems with the whole.

“Any innovation was inconceivable; to suggest the possibility of one would have invited suspicion, and because the accused were guilty until they had proved themselves innocent by surviving impossible ordeals – by fire, water, or combat – to be suspect was to be doomed.”

This is just nonsense. Innovation was inconceivable? What? Historians of the Carolingian Renaissance (supposedly occurring at the peak of the dark ages) would be surprised indeed to learn this. It's even less supportable for the High Middle Ages. Beginning in the 11th century, western Europe went through a remarkable and sustained 300-year-long economic revolution, in which trade expanded, agricultural innovations massively improved crop yields, urbanization increased, and the population tripled. Royal authority and the power of the state generally increased, preparing the path for the modern state to emerge. Scholars like Aquinas and Albertus Magnus made contributions to theology and philosophy that continue to be influential. I could go on, but I think I've more than demonstrated the problems with Manchester's work."
"I'm going to respectfully disagree with /u/ted5298 and his answer that it isn't a debate anymore just because the Emperor admitted to his Korean heritage.  Regardless of what the Emperor might say, evidence points to parallel emergence of kingship rather than Korean origin and a very strong Japan line.  

**Short answer: the imperial family is one of native origin as part of parallel paths to kingdom emergence in the region.**  The Korean ancestry *may* be attributed to Kammu's mother, but only after a line of distinct Japanese rulers.  It's akin to say I'm French because even though my family originates in the slavic countries, my great great great grandfather married a French woman and no other French-born individuals joined my family.   

Regardless, the issue is a source of contention for political reasons.  I'd view Akihito's statements as more diplomatic than anything.  

Long answer-

We have to start with a timeline: kingship and state formation in Japan (including imperial lineage) in Japan doesn't really start to take place until the 1st century BC in the Yayoi period. This is the age of Himiko, and as a number of written histories predating the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki state (such as the Records of Wei ( 魏志 ), early 5th century AD).  Various historians have discussed the ""tribal alliances"" and others ""an early state.""  Neither have been convincingly defending in recent scholarship.  But recent archaeological discoveries at Yoshinogari in Kyushu's Saga prefecture point us to what likely was the first ""seat of hierarchy of hamlets.""   A doubled-moated settlement with a sizable adjacent mounded tomb has been excavated.  Deep pillar holes suggest the double-moated areas had lookout towers similar to those described in the Records of Wei.  Excavations of the area yields bronze daggers similar to those found in Korea, glass beads from south China, baskets, pottery, and other artifacts of note.  This is important because excavation of surrounding areas do not yield metal tools from the time, indicating that Yoshinogari-kuni (kuni 国 = ""country""... or region/hamlet in these cases) dominated, in part, through their use of metal.  

It’s also important to see that diplomacy and trade existed between the Yamatai and the mainland as early as the first century BC, implying that a social hierarchy existed in which communication between the lands occurred.  Such occurrences are only natural considering increased cooperation between peoples yields to an increased need for a common ""law"" which allows for a leader (usually a charismatic one) to emerge and take on the chiefly mantle.  And, naturally, with the emergence of a sole chiefton comes both those who would seek to have that role for themselves and the need for those in the chiefly position to revalidate and legitimize their authority over non-kin within the kuni.  The excavations of Yoshinogari mentioned previously also yielded corpses, arrowheads, and other weapons of war (not to mention evidence of military towers) that showed how expansion wasn’t always peaceful; each kuni would have different ideas of power and authority that needed to be dealt with and validated.  Most times these validations would take the form of religious functions normally reserved for local leaders in kin-based communities.  

This is the second important thing to note: what rulership entails.  What would begin with religious claims to rulership would need to grow as leaders needed to provide protection for those under him and to allocate natural resources.  This would lead to tribute collection and increased administrative action from the leader down throughout the hierarchy, forming a ""ceremonial center"" of sorts where the sacerdotal chief and his administrative assistants (plus guards to keep him in power) ruled over the peasantry whose sole purpose really was to produce that which could be absorbed into the kuni’s resource pool.  Well, sole purpose might be too strong of a word; peasantry was also expected to provide military service for their chief. 

We now turn to Queen Himiko (the non-mythical version).  Taking a hint from previous peninsula leaders, some of Himiko’s first actions were to send tributes to the Chinese Emperor Wei ( 魏 ).  Emperor Wei responded, conferring the title ""Queen of Wa, Friend of Wei"" upon her and sending back ornate gifts to serve as her regalia.  This title from the most advanced civilization in the Far East furthered her validation and authority amongst the state-to-be of Wa and such a ""stamp of approval"" would become the patent necessary for participation in diplomacy and trade within the Far East region (mainly China, Korea, Japan).  China's ""seal of approval"" granted access to advancements at court and with technology while also granting the ruler the right to redistribute the fruits gained through said relations.

Himiko was not the first to send emissaries to China.  The Hou Han Shu ( 後漢書 )and archaeological evidence date Yayoi emissaries from the land of Na as early as 57 CE (Japan was called Wa 倭 at the time).  Such investiture was important for a would-be ruler in Japan, especially when the fruits born from that relationship included iron ingots.  As mentioned above, Yoshinogari possessed metal that surrounding hamlets did not.  Imported metal was important, trade was needed, and as society shifted up Honshu, it was a sign of power.  By the 2nd century AD, iron was in northeast Honshu thanks to military expansion and other kuni-rulers establishing contact with China and Korea.  

It should also be noted that archaeological evidence of conquest in Japan at the time, meaning Gojoseon or other Korean groups did not conquer and become rulers that would lead to the line of Emperors.  No evidence suggests Korean origin at all during the Yayoi or late Jomon.  

Thus we return to Yayoi... or rather, Kofun period and Yamatai / Wa.  Before, during, and after Himiko's reign, Yamatai chieftons sent emissaries to the three kingdoms- especially Paekche- and, thus, maintained contact and trade relations with the peninsula.  In the mid to late 4th century, after many years of aggressive Koguryo  activity thanks to a new wave of ‘martial kingship’ which the kings there embodied, Paekche was facing affront by both Koguryo and Silla.  Yamatai had a big investment in Paekche and the tip of the Korean peninsula mainly due to the trade ports in Kaya, aka Mimana, where the majority of iron ingot shipments originated from; troops were even stationed there.  So even as Yamatai was emerging as a full-fledged state, it was showing power by sending contingents of troops to aid Paekche in its defenses.  This continued until the beginning of the 5th century when the Chinese monarchy once again dubbed Paekche’s king ""The Great General Stabilizing the East and King of Paekche.""  Wa was regarded as a state on equal footing with both Silla and Paekche, a state worthy of receiving their respective princes for extended stays.  

Pause to acknowledge the separate state emergence in the Koreas and Japan.

Yuryaku would be the first ""King of Wa"" (Wa no o 倭之王 ) if you believe his letters to China.  In reality, he was one of five paramounts with whom the Liu Sung dynasty maintained diplomatic contacts with in the 5th century- last of the five to send an emissary, but third to receive recognition.  Historians in the past, like Inou Mistusada in the '70s, viewed this time as one of unification with one ruler in the center and many peripheries; archaeological evidence and more recent history indicates multiple polities still existed with the ""Great King"" at its center.  It seems like recent scholarship views Yuryaku as a politician of sorts as well, forging bonds through law and intermarriage with other polities in the region, but one who also faced ceaseless conflict from rivals.

"To build on this answer, this practice of ""dicta"" is a consequence of the Supreme Court staying within its constitutional bounds. For one reason or another, a Justice may feel that certain cases were decided incorrectly, or that conflicting lines of jurisprudence need to be reconciled. 

However, the Supreme Court does not make laws, and neither can it interpret laws on its own initiative. The Constitution limits the Supreme Court to issuing decisions only within the context of a ""controversy,"" meaning a dispute of parties with adverse legal rights. 

When Justice Thomas or other Justices make statements like those, they are essentially saying ""I would like the Court to have the opportunity to reevaluate the existing jurisprudence on this topic through a new (though not necessarily better) lens, so we can determine whether the current doctrine is appropriate. However, since we are bound by the Constitution, we must wait for the proper case, or an 'actual controversy,' before we can make such evaluation.""

An example similar to Thomas's statement is Justice Brennan's concurrence in [Poe v. Ullman](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/367/497/), where he agreed with the Court's refusal to issue an advisory opinion on laws outlawing contraceptives:

>The true controversy in this case is over the opening of birth control clinics on a large scale; it is that which the State has prevented in the past, not the use of contraceptives by isolated and individual married couples. It will be time enough to decide the constitutional questions urged upon us when, if ever, that real controversy flares up again."
"> A combination of factors, the most obvious being deindustrialization and suburbanization, as Newark’s white population fled the inner city to more distant suburbs. Here is an excellent series of maps that show this process in action. Of course, this was happening across the nation, but Newark’s heavily industrial economy made it even more susceptible to decline, and high racial tensions “accelerated [changes in ethnic composition] after the city was wracked by rioting in 1967.”

It's worth noting how this change in the racial composition of cities like Newark was tied to changes to immigration policy in the US. The Immigration Acts of 1917 and 1924 greatly reduced the flow of immigrant labor into NYC and greater NJ. Consequently, labor supply retracted at a point in the 1920s when the economy was surging and manufacturing capacity was growing, which created tremendous opportunities for Black Americans eager to escape the Jim Crow south. Hundreds of thousands of Black Americans moved to cities like Newark in pursuit of a better life; this pattern occurred all over the industrialized cities of the north, triggering the racial tensions and middle-class White flight that you described.

"I've written about this more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/oukjw3/a_popular_perception_of_baby_boomers_is_that_they/h743nca/). I will save a click by reproducing my answer:

...

*The Hippie Trip* from 1968 estimated 200,000 hippies, that is, less than 0.2% of the population. So you are right that the situation amplifies a minority. Even more seriously  (and being more expansive than just ""hippies""): *a great deal of the counterculture was not Baby Boomers at all*.

Let's suppose the most common definition of Baby Boomers: as being born from 1946 to 1964.

Let's also, for the sake of argument, consider the height-of-counterculture year to be 1969, the year of Woodstock, the year of the Stonewall riots, the year of the trial of the Chicago 8 (later 7 when Bobby Seale's case was severed).

How old would your Baby Boomers be?

For them to even be 18, their cutoff birth year would be 1951, only a quarter into the supposed span of the entire generation of Baby Boomers.

Now, there were certainly young people involved -- and part of the push for the 26th Amendment lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 was involving them -- but centering sole responsibility for the Counterculture Movement on Baby Boomers is very strange.

What about individual influential figures? There's no ""scientific"" way to make a ""most influential"" list, so I just grabbed a [clickbait article](https://watchmojo.com/video/id/18827) which I figured would be a good approximation, just to check how many were Baby Boomers:

>Hunter S. Thompson, gonzo journalist

>The Beatles, musicians

>Bob Dylan, musician

>Muhammad Ali, boxer and noted pacifist

>Timothy Leary, LSD advocate

>Lenny Bruce, comedian

>Gloria Steinem, feminist

>Andy Warhol, artist

>Jimi Hendrix, musician

>Jack Kerouac, writer

We'll keep the Beatles even though they aren't from the US. The birth years of all the people listed? 1937, (1940, 1942, 1943, 1940), 1941, 1942, 1920, 1925, 1934, 1928, 1942, and 1922.

In other words, *none of them are Baby Boomers*. I can assure you it is equally hard to find Baby Boomers from larger and more expansive lists. The most prominent activist I can think of that falls in that zone, Fred Hampton (famous for dying young) just squeaks into the ""Baby Boomer"" window at 1948.

The Chicago 8, the ones charged with ""conspiring to use interstate commerce with intent to incite a riot"" and ""teaching demonstrators how to construct incendiary devices that would be used in civil disturbances""? None of them were Baby Boomers either. (The oldest, David Dellinger, was born in 1915: not even of the Silent Generation, but the Greatest Generation.)

Or to take things further, consider Reagan's 1980 group voting group, which did tend to be older; you can check out [Roper's voting age breakdown here](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-groups-voted-1980). 30+ went for Reagan (at 55%) and 18-29 went for Carter (symmetrically at 55%, and this group would be entirely born in the Baby Boomer range).

Again, the ""generation"" idea doesn't necessarily flow here in a smooth way. (If you're going the ""alternating liberal-conservative"" theory, both the older generations voted for Reagan.) ​The concerns with the Iran hostage crisis, inflation, unemployment, etc. tended to concern an older generation more in 1980, just in that innately 20-year-olds might be more worried about college policies and 35-year-olds might be more worried about mortgage rates. If you really want to throw your politics for a loop, check out the 1984 election voting for Reagan:

18-24 61%, 25-29 57%, 30-49 48%, 50-64 61%, 65+ 64%

Ah-ha! you might say. That means the younger group is getting more conservative! But the actual circumstances are more complex: quoting from [a NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/16/us/younger-voters-tending-to-give-reagan-support.html) written at the time:

>For many of these new voters, the only American military action they remember is Grenada, a successful venture that posed no threat to their own security. They have never experienced the military draft, and the Vietnam era is something they hear about in history class.

>All that many young voters know about Mr. Mondale is that he was Vice President under Mr. Carter, which they see as a burden. The Minnesotan's long record in the Senate is a blur, as are the battles fought by his generation for civil rights and social programs.

They (the younger generation at the time) might not be any more conservative as far as civil rights goes, but the actual personalities involved in the election override other concerns. The fact Reagan was well-liked was [part of why Reagan survived the Iran Contra scandal](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l4x4nz/the_fallout_from_the_watergate_scandal_directly/gksgev3/) and when his reputation was being hard-hit, a deep in the scandal survey still found 72% approval when people were simply asked if they liked him as a person.

In simpler terms it appeared that: things got worse under Carter, things turned around and got better under Reagan. This isn't just a left-right concern. (The GOP did try to interpret it as snagging the younger generation, but by Clinton vs. Bush, the 18-24 group gave Bush the lowest percent of all age groups -- allegedly, if we think in terms of generations voting as blocs, part of the exact same group as the ones who voted for Reagan's 2nd term.)

Incidentally, one thing I've seen is to split Boomers into two groups, Boomer I and Boomer II, making the first half the more politically counterculture-aligned -- at least _some_ of them were old enough to go to Woodstock -- while the second half missed that wave. I've unfortunately not read enough of the analysis to know if that holds weight on the political end, but it'd make at least slightly more sense than assuming a 20-year voting bloc where it normally gets placed.

...

Social change is progressive and not always defined by a ""generational"" boundary line except in an incidental sense. To take a small example, consider the use of marijuana (a reasonable ""hippie-ness"" proxy, since the two were considered inseparable in the 60s). Gallup has been asking since 1969 if marijuana should be legalized.

[A chart of the trend](https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/ih7kp8s-m0qgspecrytpbw.png)

Note a very small initial support (12%) and near-steady increase then. In the supposedly-more-conservative-80s there was a slight slowdown and drop, but hardly a reversal. Support at 2020 is now at 68%. There wasn't a reversal of social norms; things steadily increased, until, in a sense, everyone became hippies.

"Syme talked about the ""magical quality"" of Caesar's name. When Antony and Octavian fought first politically and then with soldiers over the validity of Caesar's will they weren't just fighting about the enormous sum of money that Caesar left Octavian, itself practically an ultimatum of leadership of the Caesarians. They were also fighting over the legitimacy with which Octavian invoked Caesar's name, and all the mystical qualities it held--Octavian called himself Caesar for a reason. Mention of Caesar's name roused emotions, and even those who despised Caesar could hardly help but admit that no Roman had ever amassed so much *dignitas*, nor would any Roman do so again. We *still* talk about Caesar with hushed voices and swelling chests two thousand years later, in a world in which his *dignitas* and political influence do not matter anymore. Only months after his death the memory of Caesar among his veterans and friends, who made up much of the original force with which Octavian threatened the city and Antony, who had faced off against Pompey alongside him and won against all odds can probably never be adequately articulated. The invocation of Caesar's memory and his continuation in a new Caesar must have been more than enough reason for many to throw their lot behind Octavian. Besides such romantic considerations, Octavian arrived in the Italy as Antony was attempting to consolidate his power. Antony, as the default leader of the Caesarians, managed to smooth things over with both the senate and the conspirators, which fact alone caused great resentment among the more animated Caesarians, who wanted to see the conspirators punished. Many of these men came over to Octavian early on. As the days passed Antony's position also began to weaken. His attempt to ride the fence while simultaneously refusing to negotiate with Octavian's right to his inheritance and while being violently verbally attacked by Cicero quickly caused him to alienate many people on all sides, including quite a lot of very important Caesarians. Meanwhile, the influence of money should not be discounted--Octavian was willing to pay quite a lot of money from his own personal wealth, which probably attracted a lot of veterans in particular. And don't fall into the trap so common among students of this sort of thing and forget the influence of personal politics. This was a political struggle, one in which Octavian and Antony fought for the leadership of the Caesarians and the amassed resources of Caesar that had brought those people together. It was one in which individuals needed to take sides and in which they *did* take sides. To the individual soldier, poorly educated and more concerned with the possession or lack of leadership ability (or what he perceived as being indicative of these qualities) than the social norms that educated Roman society imposed on age, Octavian's personal magnetism--not unlike Caesar's--his determination in the face of adversity, his staunch championing of the individual soldier and support for the largess ordered by Caesar's will, and any number of qualities may well have taken precedence. Nobody ever accused Augustus of lacking charm and personality, and half the political battle, then as now, is often being likable. For many of the troops and politicians that initially came over to him, Octavian may well have been particularly special, and the added inducements of money, resentment against Antony, or whatever would have been icing on the cake. People are complicated "

As for recent history, the answer remains similar to what I said at the beginning: Patagonia isn’t a hospitable region. Sure, it’s not Siberia, but it’s as close as it gets in this area of the Global South. Extremely harsh and fast winds, very little rainfall in most of the region, inedible plants and scarce fauna, and, perhaps most importantly, a gargantuan distance separating the region from the rest of the country, which worsens the more you venture South. Being so far away from the rest of the country causes prices to rise significantly, especially for imported goods, even those imported from other provinces. And while, by comparison, wages and income are significantly higher in Patagonia than in any other region, the prospect of having to abandon one’s life and family to go live halfway across the country isn’t particularly appealing to most people. But, once again, I digress. We have to remember that Argentina, even though it may not look like it by looking at a regular world map, is the eighth largest country in the world by area. You have to travel over three thousand kilometres to go from Ushuaia, the southernmost city, to Buenos Aires. If we look at Argentina’s population density compared to that of, say, the US, we can see that Argentina’s is only half of the US. Large countries tend to be vastly depopulated, density wise, and Argentina isn’t the exception. It’s not just Patagonia, it’s most of the country."

"The perception of Samurai being exclusively mounted archers is just as flawed as the one where they’re katana-wielding warriors marching on foot in the heat of every battle. In reality, the samurai were more an economic/political caste, whose role as warriors came and went over the years.

The mounted archer “samurai” was most predominant in the Heian period, (790-1190, give or take 5 years.) During this time, samurai were indeed mostly archers who rode into battle on horseback in flashy armor, though the horses and armor were mostly there to flaunt wealth. Samurai occupied a role one step below that of the Daimyo, or local liege lord. (Daimyo were in turn one step below the Emperor, then later the Shogun, though especially during this time period their agency within their lands was far greater.) Thus, samurai were mostly either court bodyguards or mid-low level nobles (or both), who only occasionally had to march out and disperse peasant revolts or small invasions. During these revolts, they were for the most part greatly outnumbered and up against men with spears and little training or morale. The Katana just isn’t useful during these engagement, so setting up 100 men on a hill and pelting the crowd with arrows (all while looking impressive and rich) usually did the trick. When it came to disputes over territory or what have you between local lords, usually champion samurai were sent out to fight it out, one on one. 

This strategy famously fails the samurai of Japan during the invasion of the Mongol Empire in the tail end of the 13th century, and thus the kamakura period (which established feudalism and the daimyo + samurai cast as far more important) ends as one shogunate (the Ashikaga) replace another, (the minamoto.) at this point, samurai are truly samurai, owning small fiefdoms of their own sometimes and even endeavoring at times to spread their own political power. 

The warring states period 200+ years later greatly expands the role of the samurai though, who now often take up positions as captains or generals within larger armies. Though the vast majority of soldiers during the time are still just peasants with spears, Samurai increasingly join the fray wielding pole arms, bows, and katana, and as a last resort, short swords known as wakizashi. Still, even during this time, we don’t see many Katana wielding monster samurai. 

The warring states period ends with the unification of Japan, and a great period of peace that lasts nearly 250 years. During this new Edo period, samurai mostly lose their day jobs as warriors. They take to academia and courtly business, developing mathematic and philosophical systems, as well as theorizing on science and politics. They maintain their positions, to some extent their power, but with almost no battles to fight over 250 years... the only swordsman samurai still present were third or fourth generation students at swords dojo’s, more hobbyists than real warriors (even though some of them were pretty damned skilled.) 

To keep an already long answer from dragging any further: Meiji restoration comes. Half of Japan wants to modernize, half of Japan wants a return to the status quo. Samurai lose their positions early on in Meiji, (were up to the 1870s-1880s by now) and the caste system as a whole breaks down. THIS is when the master swordsman samurai myth emerges and takes shape in a way we might recognize it today. Those who opposed modernization and the end of a long isolationist period harkened back to the past, or a rather fictionalized version of it. Samurai were great warriors now, not politicians or landlords. They fought noble battles with swords, layered 7-8 times over on the forge to be able to pierce STEEL. Thus, a legendary class of warrior roots itself into the zeitgeist of a tense period in Japanese history, and the role, bravery, nobility, and legend of the samurai becomes greatly over exaggerated. 


TLDR: Samurai were never entirely mounted archers, nor entirely sword-swinging masters of combat. Sometimes they were a private police force for daimyo, sometimes they owned small bits of land and fought on the side, and sometimes they were a caste of scholars and mathematicians. The image we have of samurai now is greatly influenced by pop culture, which was in turn greatly influenced by the propagandized version of Samurai heralded by the last holdouts of the Edo period, men challenged by modernization and looking for a return to the glory of the past.

"Well, medieval travel writers knew that the Chinese used toilet paper.

But I'm getting ahead of myself here.

> There was, in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, a powerful King among the Kings of China...He was wealthy as he was powerful, but he had grown old without being blessed with a son...At last, he sought the intercession of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) with the Most High and implored Him, by the glory of His Prophets and Saints and Martyrs...that he would grant him a son.

> *[it works]*

> He committed his boy to...the harim till he reached the age of seven. Then he ...gathered together the Olema (*ulema*) and philosophers and doctors of law and religion, from all countries. 

> *-from ""The Craft and Malice of Women,"" Burton trans.*

""'Alā' ad-Dīn and the Wonderful Lamp"" is kind of an awkward text to work with. The manuscript tradition (...traditions) of the *1001 Nights* is a mess already--our earliest notions of the text are only 1000 nights, for starters, and no surviving copy gets close to having 1001 tales. But probably the most famous of the tales even before Disney has special problems, namely, it isn't actually part of that medieval manuscript tradition at all. The way medieval texts including/especially *1001 Nights* worked, that absolutely doesn't mean it's not just as deeply rooted as others. But when a story first shows up in the 17th/18th century as Europeans are getting their hands on the text, there's room for caution.

Fortunately, tales like the frame story ""The Craft and Malice of Women,"" which has an alternate title but why would you ever use it, serve as a fine substitute. The frame and some of its internal tales trace back through the Egyptian manuscript tradition, so we're good here.

I dumped a block quote on you at the beginning so you could situate yourself: we've got a ""King of the Kings"" of China (a title that medieval Arabic geographers use when talking about a land they're a bit more familiar with, Persia), an *ulema* or class of Muslim scholars, astrologers, philosophers, religious leaders, and--oh yeah--Islam. In other words, we're dealing with the trappings of medieval Islamic culture in this text, too.

But, well...this doesn't exactly coincide with what merchant, diplomats, and ethnographers are writing about China just about the same time people start writing down *1001 Nights* collections (or at least, ones that survive). For starters:

>  I do not know of a single member of [China or India] who is a Muslim, and Arabic is not spoken.

Our ninth-century informant adopted by 10th century author Abū Zayd al-Ḥasan al-Sīrāfī has more to say comparing the two lands:

> India is the land of medicine and of philosophers; the Chinese also have medical knowledge. Most of their medicine involves cauterization. In addition, they have a knowledge of astronomy and astrology, although this is more widespread in India.

Just from the *beginning* of the tale, then, it's clear that *The Craft and Malice of Women* is set in a fantastical China, not the actual one. The examples continue, like houses being made of stucco instead of wood. We'll return to the fantasy in a bit, because as promised: toilet paper.

Abū Zayd and whatever earlier accounts he's drawing on for the first book of his text (he probably doesn't know for sure and it may well have multiple sources; a later author attributes excerpts from it to a merchant called Sulayman) offer a surprisingly rich view of early medieval China. In the beginning of book two, in fact, Abū Zayd recounts a long history of a recent rebellion! But it's especially fascinating to see what details of Chinese culture the geographer-ethnographers and their sources emphasize.

> The Chinese are unhygienic, and they do not wash their backsides with water after defecating but merely wipe themselves with paper. 

Yeah, like that one.

Throughout the text, comparisons to Arab culture or other known cultures help the original readers understand China and help us understand why Abū Zayd et al. emphasize particular details.

> Their staple food is rice. They often cook a sauce to go with it, which they
pour on the rice before eating it. Their ruling classes, however, eat wheat
bread and the ﬂesh of all sorts of animals, including pigs and other such
creatures. 

Eating all meats is a big deal to the Muslim observer. Elsewhere, he compares Chinese religious practices to Zoroastrians. This is a good remind not to take everything at face value, though. Anna Akasoy has shown that ""Zoroastrianism"" (a twisted idea thereof) was a common framework through which Muslim ethnographers sought to understand foreign religions in, for example, West Africa.

Given the consternation we see on AskHistorians about medieval Muslims and alcohol, this is a particularly interesting observation:

> Their drink is a wine made from rice. Grape wine is not to
be found in their land, and it is never imported—indeed, they do not know of it and do not drink it. 

It looks like our author is quite familiar with wine made from grapes!

We also learn that the Chinese tax foreign imports at a 30% rate, have a fiscal bureaucracy staffed by eunuchs, and place an enormous premium on reading and writing. I'll include another passage that's a popular interest topic on AskHistorians: a sort of premodern passport:

> Anyone wanting to travel from one part of China to another obtains two documents.
The document from the ruler is a permit for the road, made out in the name
of the traveler and those accompanying him, and stating his age and his
companions’ ages, and the tribe from which he comes...The second document concerns the traveler’s money and any goods he may have. 

> The reason for this
procedure is that there are guardposts on the road where they examine both

I don't have to tell you not to take all this as surah truth about early medieval China. In most cases we're dealing with multiple layers of transmission, and a culture where repeating earlier stories was as good as firsthand observation/often treated as firsthand observation. Nevertheless, modern scholars generally consider the fact-checkable points somewhat reliable--at least, much more so than contemporary accounts like *The Wonders of India*, a fascinating collection of sailors' stories in which basically everyone gets shipwrecked on a island of Amazons or cannibals.

I've already mentioned the difficult heritage of this text. It survives in one damanged manuscript copy today. But we know that whoever wrote it in the 9th century, it was read and copied in the 10th by Abū Zayd and by the Persian scholar Ibn
al-Faqīh. In other words, in the Middle Ages, this text got around a little!

But then we have to balance the scholars versus the storytellers. When we talk about ""medieval Muslims' knowledge of China,"" we shouldn't just think about the best-connected. While obviously also not everyone was reading *1001 Nights* itself, the ubiquity of many of its stories around the Mediterranean world suggests a much more common currency for them than for Abū Zayd.

And don't let the insertion of Islam, science, kings, and harems--perfectly ordinary elements of life to medieval Muslims!--fool you. The China of the *1001 Nights* is a China ""days of yore and in ages and times long gone before""--it's stocked full of the magic that, even if not the *specific* story of Ala ad-Din, the same air of exoticism and, dare I say it, Orientalism."
"Hi there - just a minor correction that jxf was the OP of the linked question, rather than the answer. Quality answers in that thread were provided by /u/ambarenya, /u/matkline and /u/military_history."
"Yes, massively so. I didn't get into it in detail in my answer, but the work of categorising folktale and fairytale by, among others, Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm and (later) Vladimir Propp in his *Morphology of the Folktale* is considered a major step in the evolution of the modern genre. I'm not an expert on the Disney influence but would speculate that yes, their reinterpretation and repopularisation of some of those stories in the first half of the 20th century was probably an influence as well."
"A good follow-up question, and one I unfortunately don't have a great answer to in terms of substance; I can tell you that most medieval scholars attributed authorship of the *Commentarii* to one Julius Celsus Constantinus, a grammarian. This is the name that appears at the end of each book in a group of manuscripts of the *Commentarii*, so you can't really blame them for confusion!

I can also tell you that it was the Italian statesman Coluccio Salutati (1331 - 1406) who demonstrated that it was Caesar himself who authored the *Commentarii*, though the precise nature of how he showed this is unknown to me (though maybe someone could enlighten us?)."
"So the game designers sure got one thing right: if your DM does put a wolf along your path, your medieval-esque character would be terrified.

Medieval western Europeans were so scared of wolves, specifically, that they often equated wolves and outlaws. As I've [written on AH](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ufacg/in_fantasy_literature_travelling_groups_are_often/d5pnxur/):

""While Gerard Breen points out that *many* cultures link criminals and dangerous animals, the association between wolves and wandering outlaw-criminals is particularly strong across western Europe.

The Norse sagas, for example, use dog and hound imagery to discuss exiles and avengers. But straight-up murderers and criminals might wear wolf cloaks or earn the sobriquet *Ulfr.*

In England, too, the connection between wolves and outlaws was strong--strong enough to be codified as law! An outlaw could be declared ""wolfesheed""--literally, *a wolf's head.* In the later Middle Ages, this meant that the outlaw could be hunted like a wolf, that is, with abandon and all due legality. In the pre-Norman Conquest days, when the term seems to originate, the point was that killing an outlaw and killing a wolf earned the same bounty.""

Where this equation comes into play here is the not-unjustified notion of outlaws as bandits along the roads. It's not a one-one connection, and medieval people knew that perfectly well. However, bandits were a *major* threat to travelers across the entire world. 

They're one of the reasons even the account of Ibn Battuta, the audacious and fearless 14th century Moroccan, has him easily convinced to travel across the North African coast in a caravan on his hajj. And why Christian and Jewish pilgrims to Jerusalem were willing to be exorbitant prices (to people of all religions) for accompaniment across assorted deserts.

But I've diverted from the point: fear of wild animals. Some of our richest sources for medieval travel come from the narratives of pilgrims to the Near East. Most pilgrims follow a standardized format of pretty much just listing which holy sites they visited. Others are more effusive. And we hear a lot more about *fear* of animal attacks than actual attacks.

Niccolo da Martoni, for example, has to use a standard (and rather wrong) description of the crocodile, because he never even saw one--he only heard about it. However, his description specifically notes that crocodiles attacked boats in order to eat the people. Felix Fabri was similarly unhappy about the hippopotami in the Nile. Crossing the Alps, travelers stick wild animals in with simple catalogues of the dangers they faced.

But there's a little more to our story.

Bertrandon de La Brocq́uière describes coming across a giant lizard he did not recognize...and his guides, who did recognize it, were so scared they ran away. The Europeans, SO BRAVE, dismounted their horses and it ATTACKED THEM, and one of them eventually cut its throat.

...The part of the story I didn't tell you there, however, was that when the guides fled, so did the lizard. And it tried to hide. The European pilgrims pursued it, swords already in hand. The lizard jumped at one of them in self defense *after* it had been attacked. (SO BRAVE.)

The point here is: travelers were so scared of wild animals that they talked about attacks by ones they never saw. They *added* mentions of attacks by wild animals onto standard encyclopedia (bestiary) descriptions. *They didn't even need to be attacked to be scared of wild animals.*

And then there's a wolf attack, one that actually happened and that was initiated by the wolves. It wasn't against travelers, but it certainly amped up fear of the wild animals.

In the late Middle Ages--as human settlements increased and spread out, and wilderness shrank--there were multiple accounts of wolves threatening Paris (of all places). The most notable is certainly the winter of 1438. That year, [and I am not making this up](http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&O=NUMM-102925), wolves *slid into Paris on the frozen Seine River* and attacked the prey they could find in the streets--pigs, dogs...one chronicler even says they killed a baby, although that could easily be apocryphal or actually the work of a pig.

...But why did the wolves ice-skate into Paris? Because they were starving. Not because they were the brutal beasts who were so dangerous that they were sometimes used as iconography for the devil. They were, if you will, chaotic neutral. It was a matter of survival and circumstance, not innate evil.

That's not what medieval Europeans tended to see, however. And to circle back right to the beginning, including as I've [previously written](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ufacg/in_fantasy_literature_travelling_groups_are_often/d5powzs/) on AH:

""Perhaps most interesting in the current context is a particularly fearsome wolf who became infamous enough in Paris to earn the nickname Courtaud or 'short-tail.' Courtaud appeared in the midst of a wave of wolves actually killing humans of all ages in Paris, and 'people spoke of him like they would a bandit of the forest'--an outlaw robber of the highways.""

My answer was intended to try and tackle the question itself, which is quite broad. So I tried to reflect the popular perception of resorts (health and recreational) as depicted in fictional media, contemporary news media, and personal accounts of Soviet citizens, and try to place these facilities in people's daily life. I probably did it like so because I am a Russian film historian / journalist by degree, and my areas of interest are culture studies and everyday history.

**Among the additional information we can glean from these papers is:**

- Regarding the ""14-day vacation"" bit: specifically a sanatorium stay was standardized as being 24, 26, 28 days or more. So it would be a special type of vacation, officially going beyond the usual 14 days off.

- I didn't touch on the *pre-war sanatoriums and resorts* because — alongside being real places where Soviet doctors and hospitality specialists developed the industry — they were also heavily intertwined with propaganda depicting the desired, idealized state of things to inspire and promise; precious few benefited from these small resorts, but it was not nearly something accessible to everyone. (Still, besides old revolutionary guard and prized specialists, a healthy chunk of the clients were regular factory workers). Meanwhile, the post-war resort system was very large, and gradually became accessible to more and more people, especially in the cities (the kolkhoz population, as always, lagged far behind in everything, and it was perceived as par of the course).

- The historical overview article points out an important reason *why it was unions distributing the tickets*. Initially, most resorts were naturally patronized by specific organizations and existed as a form of job perk for specialists or management, from writers and filmmakers to ministries and aircraft design bureaus; and, first and foremost, for ""old revolutionaries"" and government officials. But come 1950s, when more and more resorts were being built, this ""system"" became incredibly atomized and hence grossly bloated, teeming with middle management prone to corruption, or having the tickets simply distrubuted inside the organizations according to internal office politics. 

- Centralizing and consolidating resorts (with some serious backlash from orgs that got used to ""their"" favorite spots) allowed to streamline the industry and formalize the criteria for ticket distribution. Starting in 1960, most sanatoriums, as well as recreational resorts and ""pansionats"" (vacation guest houses) were subordinated to union commitees, to distribute the tickets for free or for 30% of the listed price (the rest covered by the union). Depending on one's social services perks, similar vacations packages could be comped by social services, too.

- In 1960-1980s, the idealized goal of providing recuperative stays and resort vacations as needed to all laborers became to correlate much better with reality. *From being propaganda-as-media for most people, sanatoriums and recreational resorts became propaganda-in-action*, serving as tactile showcases of the advances the country has achieved: neat, architecturally modern, with unusually good service, etc. While not nearly easy or trivial to get, and not always free, this ""little piece of communism"" became realistically in reach for a large part of the USSR's working population.

- It was not effortless though; one article talks about the steep prices for ""additional services"" one could face while vacationing in a popular spot, and *the phenomenon of ""savage"", or ""wild"" vacationers*, who coudn't get an official ticket (путёвка or курсовка) but came to enjoy the resort anyway — and so created a bustling gray market for apartment rent and other tourist services in late-Soviet resort towns; an intimately familiar reality to anyone vacationing in Crimea even in the 2000s. Apparently, this was also not unique to late-Soviet resorts: one article cites historian Piontkovsky's diary in 1928 describing ""thousands of vacationers"" coming to visit the Caucasus mineral water spas, who were serviced entirely by private vendors and hustlers, — with the sole exception of government-managed mineral baths. Another article has a 1936 account of an entire DIY resort (!) which cropped up in a meadow near mineral springs — made up of simple wooden dormitories and huts, and welcoming various ethnic minorities from surrounding valleys and towns in a sort of a commune.

- And in any case, as you may guess, *not all Soviet sanatoriums were ever created the same*, and the experiences offered in elite ones were meticulously tiered according to one's nomenclature status and party standing. The ""scientists"" paper describes lots of haggling about better accomodations (""a deluxe, or at least a semi-deluxe with a dedicated bathroom!""), using letters of recommendation from party officials and the Academy of Sciences. On the flipside, when the same functionary gradually became irrelevant with age, he stopped getting tickets at all.

- Meanwhile, in the 1970s, the wide network of sanatoriums started to be used in a more straightforward way — as *rehabilitation centers for recuperating patients* (heart attack survivors, post-operative cardio and gastro-intestinal patients), freeing up hospital space and increasing quality of care. After all, in 1972, there were already 1200 treatment-enabled sanatoriums, and 1400 preventative care (""prophylaxis"") sanatoriums in the USSR. By 1990, these figures became ~1200 treatment, 2250 preventative (all cited ""according to *People's Economy of USSR* and Rosstat""); other datapoint puts the figure at 5850 sanatoriums total at the start of 1990s.

- One article talks about another ""org-patronized"" network of resorts and sanatoriums, the ones used by the military. Regarding the post-war situation, it describes how ""high-priority"" servicemen could naturally expect more coverage with resort vacations (people like nuclear sub crews, jet pilots, foreign conflict tour veterans, intelligence officers, and later Chernobyl liquidators). It cites specific prices for the tickets: 160 to 200 rubles for a sanatorium stay (24–26 days), and 110 rubles for a recreational resort stay (24 days). These prices were fixed and they never bothered to change them. 1970s saw ""deluxe accomodations"" introduced to sanatoriums, which implied personal bathroom facitilies.

**To conclude, thank you for challenging me, it was definitely the right thing to do! I had fun, and the answer hopefully became much more comprehensive.**"

"My youngest is currently 7 and in regular public school in Washington state while my oldest is 19 and went through regular public school in both Texas and Washington. So far in WA we havent actually had any issues with things being inaccurate, at most I'd say things are just sort of partially true where the rest of the story and the context isn't really filled in and when that happens I fill in the context myself and I usually provide sources that we read through and discuss together. So far this hasn't caused any issues beyond my kids sometimes thinking I'm annoying for making them do extra work. 

Back in Texas there were outright lies right in the books and I would just say that (this isn't true, here's what's actually true) and my kid would be interested in learning why all these untrue things are being taught in school which gave us a really great opportunity to discuss how these kinds of problems are systemic and all the different moving parts that goes into creating a school curriculum or a textbook and all the different people and choices involved in maintaining that system. Understanding the systemic nature of the problem and that teachers are kind of at the ""bottom"" of this massive structure where the teachers themselves have very little control helped open up a lot of other discussions and it was just really great. It fostered a genuine interest in learning that went far beyond the classroom, there was empathy for the teachers, and also some good lessons about how resistance works bc while you're stuck in the system there's very little you can do about it (like, you still have to go to school and take is seriously bc that just is how life works, deal with it) but it is possible to create small opportunities like writing a really accurate report as part of an assignment or speaking up in class to challenge the curriculum (with sources!) and stuff like that. 

Basically, it's not easy but it is doable and you just have to keep having lots of conversations about it over and over and over again. Teach the kids the why and the how of everything so that they can understand the context, teach the kids how to respectfully disagree with someone and how to safely challenge an authority figure, have your kid's back when sometimes that doesn't go well (bc sometimes it won't and it's more important to support your kid than a lying curriculum), help them learn how to navigate the system in a way that helps them resist without hurting anything or anyone, help them learn how to do research well and most importantly help them understand that learning is more than just school and school is kind of just a job, do what you need to do but don't treat it like gospel."

"Ah. Well. From the graveyard of removed comments I think we can surmise that even a good 31 years after the end of Reagan's presidency, and more than 16 years after his death, his Presidency produces *feelings*, both strongly positive and negative. 

Anyway, if we dive into the results linked to on the Wkipedia page,  we can tease out some possible answers to your question. First, we're discounting the popular surveys - the fact that JFK, Bill Clinton and Reagan tend to rank the highest in those surveys makes me believe that a lot of the polled Americans associate nostalgia with Presidential administrations, and that's a whole different field to cover.

So focusing on the scholar surveys and the scores as linked, first we should note one very curious thing - of the sixteen total sources listed, the first five very solidly place Reagan in the middling range, mostly being in the third quartile. It's only around 2000 that Reagan marches up to the top ranks. So for a good decade or so after Reagan's presidency, his legacy was considered by historians to be extremely ambivalent.

Now, to focus on the 21st century sources, I'm very much drawn to the Sierra College Research Institute and C-SPAN in particular, because unlike the others, which seem to be mostly asking historians ""give this president a score, and we'll tally all the figures up"", these two surveys both were conducted a number of times, and breakdown the scores for each president into sub-categories, so we are able to see in which areas historians think a President's administration was good, middling and poor. 

The most recent Sierra College data is [here](https://scri.siena.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Presidents-2018-Rank-by-Category.pdf), for those who are interested, and the most recent C-SPAN data is [here](https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2017/?personid=337).

Now we see some further curious things. Starting with the C-SPAN data, Reagan's highest scores are ""Public Persuasion"" (90.9), ""Vision/Setting an Agenda"" (84.9), and ""International Relations"" (76.8). His three lowest scores are ""Pursued Equal Justice for All"" (44.6), ""Administrative Skills"" (47.4), and ""Economic Management"" (60.9 - this actually puts him 16th and in between John Adams and John Quincy Adams). So interestingly, even though this survey overall ranks Reagan as 9th, it's with his administration itself being considered not well run, being very unequal in its domestic impacts, and having OK-but-not-amazing economic returns.

Now let's look at Sierra College (Reagan score: 13th), which has a frankly dizzying data set with overall scores, overall sub-scores in ""Attributes"", ""Abilities"" and ""Accomplishments"", and then *sub-sub-scores* within those fields. Now we are *really* drilling down into data. All his scores are relatively high (nothing in Buchanan or Andrew Johnson territory), but some are middling. His lowest scores are ""Intelligence"" (31), ""Background"" (27), ""Integrity"" (24), and ""Executive Appointments"" (20). In the middle are ""Court Appointments"" (18), ""Handling of US Economy"" (18), and ""Domestic Accomplishments"" (16), and his highest scores are ""Leadership Ability"" (7), ""Relationship with Congress"" (6), ""Party Leadership"" (4), and most notably ""Luck""(3).

Honestly the Sierra College rankings feel almost like damning Reagan with faint praise. He comes off as relatively unimaginative, and with an OK-but-not-great domestic record, but outstanding scores on vision, communication and above all luck. 

I think there's something to this. There is a lot to be said for Reagan being ""the Great Communicator"", who more or less realigned US politics with his election, and steered the Republican Party towards a form of ideological conservatism (beating out the party's older, more moderate and Northeastern wing, best personified by George H.W. Bush), and on top of that was able to win away ""Reagan Democrats"" in his two election victories, although it's worth noting that this didn't necessarily translate into Republican victories further down the slate: the House of Representatives kept its Democratic majority from 1955 to 1995, despite Reagan's electoral success, and despite his 1980 victory helping to flip the Senate to a Republican majority in 1981 (for the first time since 1955), it reverted to a Democratic majority in 1987. Reagan did have a knack for boiling complicated ideas down into simple phrases that he could deliver with aplomb, in no small part because of his acting background (""There you go again"", ""Trust But Verify"", ""A Recession is when your neighbor loses a job, a depression is when you lose your job, and recovery is when President Carter loses his""). 

But I want to focus a bit on that highest score in particular: in a lot of ways, Reagan was a *lucky* president. Deregulation was started in the 1970s, and busting inflation was initiated by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in 1979, but the actual economic benefits accrued under Reagan's presidency. Even anti-inflationary policies (in part spurred by the Fed trying to raise interest rates to fight the danger of inflation caused in no small part by Reagan's deficit spending) caused a severe and long-lasting downturn from July 1981 to November 1982 that saw unemployment rise to its highest levels since the Great Depression, and Reagan's approval ratings sink. It's by some luck, however, that this cleared up and the economy began growing before the 1984 elections (in reverse, George H.W. Bush had the *highest approval ratings ever* in 1991, but the following recession in 1992 destroyed those ratings and helped in his electoral defeat that year). Reagan was also lucky that his aggressive stance towards the Soviet Union in 1981-1983 didn't unintentionally ignite World War III, especially during the 1983 Able Archer exercises that the Soviet leadership feared was a cover for an actual first strike. He's lucky that his Soviet counterpart from 1985 on was Mikhail Gorbachev, who was genuinely interested in de-escalation of Cold War tensions, and built a successful diplomatic relationship with Reagan - and also unilaterally did much of the work, despite what [myths](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8cnm73/did_reagans_star_wars_project_really_contribute/dxgq0lh/) of ""Reagan winning the Cold War"" or ""Reagan defeating Communism"" might say. He's lucky that the Iran-Contra Affair wasn't presidency-ending, which it could have been (I suspect the low marks for ""Integrity"", ""Intelligence"" and ""Administrative Skills"" come in here...the best that could be argued in Reagan's defense during the scandal is that he had no idea what multiple people in his administration were doing in terms of violating the law), and that it occurred relatively late in his administration. He was lucky that the biggest daily stock market crash in US history (""Black Monday""), didn't have knock-on effects in the ""real"" economy, and that the Savings and Loan crisis that *did* impact the US economy negatively didn't really have knock-on effects until after Reagan left office. 

Maybe there's a bigger lesson here - a lot of presidents tend to be lucky, or unlucky, as there are many, many contingencies that occur during their time in office that they may or may not actually be responsible for. But it happens on their watch, so they tend to either get the credit - or the blame."

I gest *slightly* though, I would note, as Binga made his money in real estate, so in point of fact, much of his wealth was 'stored' in buildings and property, but my point is that the cutting out from banking of African-Americans was de facto, not de jure, and with enough money, it wouldn't be impossible to find a bank to do business with you despite being black. Checking through everything, I don't have any mention of *what* bank might have been willing to provide services for Binga, but there is no reason to believe that his level of wealth wouldn't have opened doors unavailable to 99 percent of the African-American population."

"A quick additional point related to this (great) answer that's sort of in my line of work: Generally speaking, modern people assume that knowledge like this is passed down by writing, and that it's learned in some sort of formal educational institution, because that's how we do things in our modern age. Even technical and trade education involves a lot of reading in a formal setting. 

This isn't true of either the roman period or the middle ages, particularly the earlier middle ages. The overwhelming majority of practical trade knowledge was passed on through informal mentorship or, in some cases, formalized apprenticeships. These sort of skilled tradesmen were often fairly well off, but they weren't usually the sort of people who wrote books, so even books concerned with the practical arts tend to be written as very ""high concept"" and theoretical works, either useful only theoretically or to someone who already has a strong practical knowledge base.

Even when that isn't the case, there are often a lot of assumptions made about what the reader must know from practical education. One wouldn't generally write down something fairly basic like the recipe for concrete. Why waste expensive writing materials when you can just show your students how to do it? As the empire broke down and demand for these sort of services died out, many of these mentorship chains were broken, and it's fairly easy for knowledge of this kind to disappear when it isn't useful."

"Mormon History! This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures! I'm going to assume that you are not Mormon, but if you are, please forgive me for explaining something you already know. If you look at current LDS sources for information about the early history of the LDS church you will find that it is all [correlated](http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Correlation_of_the_Church_Administration). This basically means that the Church has simplified and whitewashed its history into something more socially acceptable. Because of this it can be difficult for active members of the Church to find sources and information that they consider acceptable. This is also why sometimes Mormons (or non-Mormons) will hear about something in Mormon history and feel like they should have known about it, but didn't. The Utah War in general, and [Mountain Meadows Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Meadows_massacre) in specific are good examples.

The Utah War is a period where Brigham Young was using his influence to try to control many aspects of the Utah Territory. Keep in mind that when the Utah War started the Mormon Pioneers (Saints) had been in the Salt Lake Valley for about a decade, and Brigham Young had amassed a huge amount of power in that time. This all started with the Mormon Reformation which is a time when Brigham Young started pushing the Saints to follow the law of polygamy, and accept him as the leader of the Church, Territory, and Army (Nauvoo Legion). You can learn a lot about this time period by reading [Wife No. 19](https://www.amazon.com/Wife-No-Paperback-Eliza-Young/dp/184902832X) by Ann Eliza Young. She also discusses how Young had become a dictator in Utah Territory at that time, and how his desires were turned into action and violence within Utah.

So, what actually happened? The simple answer is ""not much"" but, as with much of history, things are more complicated than they might at first look. As I recall the trouble started when the [Willie-Martin Handcart Companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_handcart_pioneers#1856:_Willie_and_Martin_handcart_companies) struck disaster in Wyoming in October 1856. In response to this tragedy the United States sent soldiers and investigators to Utah to try to figure out why such a disaster happened. While this might seem like a normal response, for Young it was an attack on him, his leadership, and his people. You can get an idea of how often he felt this way about any criticism by also reading the [Journal of Discourses](https://www.lds.org/topics/journal-of-discourses?lang=eng). 

Young started to order the Saints to make the lives of Gentile soldiers (non-Mormons) difficult by doing things like spooking livestock, burning supply wagons, and harassing them. The Saints felt justified in doing this because of the persecution they had suffered in the past, and they wanted to stand up for themselves now. At this point things might have all blown over, if not for the death of [Parley P. Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parley_P._Pratt).

Pratt was murdered in Arkansas, while on a mission, by the jealous husband of a woman he had converted to Mormonism and wanted to take as a plural wife. Her husband found out, found Pratt and killed him. Sadly, at about the same time as Pratt's death a Pioneer company also from Arkansas set out for California. The Baker-Fancher party had nothing to do with the death of Pratt, but that was not the message the Saints received. By the time Baker-Fancher arrived in SLC there were many who believed that they were responsible for the death of a beloved Elder in the Church. The Saints refused to sells provisions to the group (or perhaps they were ordered not to), and the group moved south to Utah Valley and Provo where they were, again, unable to resupply. Finally they were told of a place further south where they could camp and try to regroup and figure out what to do to get across Death Valley and to California.

The Baker-Fancher party arrived in Mountain Meadows in early September 1857. They were the besieged by a group consisting mostly of Mormons dressed as Paiute Indians, although there may have been a few Paiute involved. After 3 days they were then massacred on September 11, 1857. Over 130 men, women, and children were killed, and only 18 children under the age of 8 were saved. Those children were raised for about a year by Mormon foster parents, some of whom had participated in the massacre, until they were rescued and returned to their families in Arkansas.

This was pretty much the end of the Utah War. The massacre stirred up too much attention, and with the polygamy also being pushed at the time there was pressure to back off and lie low for a while.

Sources I used (although much of this is from memory, so if I'm wrong I'll be happy to admit it):

[Wife No. 19 by Ann Eliza Young](https://www.amazon.com/Wife-No-Paperback-Eliza-Young/dp/184902832X) was originally published in 1875 and is a somewhat contemporary telling of the same events.

[The Journal of Discourses](https://www.lds.org/topics/journal-of-discourses?lang=eng) is a great source of information, but is very dense. I have not read all of them, and mostly only excerpts.

[Massacre at Mountain Meadows](https://www.amazon.com/Massacre-Mountain-Meadows-Ronald-Walker-ebook/dp/B004JU1WJ0/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=) is specifically about the event, and is also a good read.

Each episode is sourced on the website, and Lindsey Hansen Park has done an amazing job with it! Specific episodes about this subject are: [episode 116: Frontier Massacres](http://www.yearofpolygamy.com/tag/mountain-meadows-massacre/).

"***...cont'd***

After 1900, these types of mentions become more ubiquitous, with grocery stores selling ""dill pickles"" and ""sour pickles"" in jars and in quantities that would insinuate pickled cucumbers were the likely product.

In 1916, Walt Anderson opened his first hamburger counter in Wichita, Kansas. Five years later, he would co-found the White Castle fast food chain, though his burger recipe is thought to have been the same, with pickles being an ingredient from the start (or at least near the start). While I cannot find an original menu for White Castle or Anderson's earlier restaurants, [an ad for a lunch counter](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86088651/1916-11-17/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=1900&index=4&rows=20&words=HAMBURGERS+pickles&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1919&proxtext=%22hamburgers%22+%22pickles%22&y=24&x=17&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=) in Texas in 1916 appears to imply that ""pickles"" were part of their hamburger lunch, and [a 1924 ad for a hamburger stand](https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&d=CRE19240611-01.2.87.1&e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7ctxCO%7ctxTA-%22hamburgers%22+%22pickle%22-------0--) in Colorado directly says that pickles were a hamburger topping. [An essay](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2017270500/1918-01-01/ed-1/seq-6/#date1=1900&index=8&rows=20&words=hamburger+pickles&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1919&proxtext=%22hamburgers%22+%22pickles%22&y=24&x=17&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1) published in South Dakota that ran on January 1, 1918, joked that humans ""started out with roots and berries but soon adopted a menu of cherry pie, pickles, and hamburgers"".

And then as mentioned in the other posts, no later than the 1920s, manufacturers were marketing jarred pickled cucumbers as simply ""pickles"" nationwide, such as [Libby's Dill Pickles](https://www.ebay.com/itm/1929-Libbys-Dill-Pickles-Canned-Foods-Vintage-1920s-Food-Kitchen-Decor-Ad/153880666137?hash=item23d400a019:g:6jQAAOSw5IZegAQ4) in the *Saturday Evening Post*.

I suspect the deli and restaurant culture in New York City and the wider Northeast probably played some role as well. German immigrants had been most associated with the New York delis (they even coined the term) before the 1880s, but thereafter and into the mid-1900s, Jewish immigrants throughout Eastern Europe began to be more identified with the delis. Germans had already been known for their pickles, and Jewish people had their own renowned reputation. The Lower East Side had many storefronts around the turn of the century dedicated solely to pickles. This could be any vegetable, but with the ease of growth in the Northeast and good use of soil, as detailed in the aforementioned *The Cultivator & Country Gentleman* article, cucumbers were abundant. The delis and the lunch counters began offering them as a side with a sandwich and other meals - though this is speculative. More research would be needed to confirm for sure.

Regardless, from all this, I would conclude that, at least in the Northeastern United States, ""pickle"" had begun to narrow to mean pickled cucumbers between the 1870s and 1890s, though earlier in that timeframe, many people may still have needed clarification. Between the 1890s and the 1910s, this had spread throughout the rest of the United States, and possibly had started as early as the 1880s. By 1920, an American almost certainly would have understood a ""pickle"" to be a pickled cucumber, and I suspect that date is a bit late.

To cast a wider net, it happened between 1870 and 1920. More narrowly, I think 1890-1910 is the critical period when most Americans would have begun to understand the meaning of ""pickles"" to specifically refer to pickled cucumbers.

**EDIT**: A little more research and it can be pushed back a bit earlier.

The February 1865 edition of *The American Agriculturalist* contains [this passage](https://books.google.com/books?id=4zcBpHGlMWQC&pg=PA47&dq=cucumbers+call+pickles&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiutafxjtnqAhVId6wKHQAoBxoQ6AEIQDAD#v=onepage&q=cucumbers%20call%20pickles&f=false):

> ""Noadiah Tubbs (they call him Diah, for short, and sometimes Uncle Di), lives on the banks of the Bronx, about a dozen miles from the city...He is a pretty fair farmer...**He knows a heap about raising cucumbers, which they call pickles in all this region. Whether they have heard that the world uses any thing else  besides cucumbers for pickles, I couldn't say**...I find, as I go about, that every region has some new kink in farming, some special crop that I've never paid much attention to. All around Diah's they grow cucumbers by the thousand. Almost every farmer near a railroad depot puts in an acre or two, and gets about as much clean cash from the patch as he does from the rest of the farm."" 

In 1867, a book published in New York entitled *The Market Assistant*, noted under [their entry for ""cucumbers""](
https://books.google.com/books?id=VXgkAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA331&dq=%22call+them+pickles%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz4MyQktnqAhUPi6wKHQGvAb8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22call%20them%20pickles%22&f=false):

> ""The quite young or small ones, of various sizes, are used to make pickles — in fact, many persons call them pickles when asking for them."" 

In 1898, [a report](https://books.google.com/books?id=f5M6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA382&dq=%22called+pickles%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQg6usjtnqAhUGWa0KHQyzD44Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=%22called%20pickles%22&f=false) prepared by an agency of New York state also confirmed that pickling cucumbers were ""universally"" referred to as ""pickles"".

So it may go back even further, at least in that area of the United States, to some time before the Civil War. [An 1844 article](https://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn83030384/1844-01-10/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=01%2F01%2F1830&index=1&date2=12%2F31%2F1865&searchType=advanced&SearchType=prox10&sequence=0&words=called+pickles+them&proxdistance=10&to_year=1865&rows=20&ortext=&from_year=1830&proxtext=call+them+pickles&phrasetext=&andtext=&dateFilterType=range&page=1) in the *New York Post*, for example, mentioned that cranberries and sauerkraut could be used as substitutes for pickles, which doesn't entirely make sense unless something specific is being referred to, since sauerkraut itself *is* a pickled vegetable. In 1853, a magazine article [referred to](https://books.google.com/books?id=5LQfAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA207&dq=%22pickle+farm%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilx9aqttnqAhVEX60KHT2LCXsQ6AEIYjAI#v=onepage&q=%22pickle%20farm%22&f=false) a ""pickle-farm"" in Beverly, New Jersey, without clarifying what crops were raised there.

In the rest of the country, the narrowing of ""pickle"" came later, but it appears the transition began before the 1900s:

In 1878, [a report](https://books.google.com/books?id=n545AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA561&dq=cucumbers+%22known+as+pickles%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj37s2KsNnqAhVHF6wKHZerAdcQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=cucumbers%20%22known%20as%20pickles%22&f=false) for the Iowa Agricultural Society said that cucumbers were ""widely known as pickles"". An 1896 issue of *The Wisconsin Horticulturalist* [referred to](https://books.google.com/books?id=Apn4uS0Msi4C&pg=RA22-PA17&dq=pickle+growers&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBrLPrstnqAhUMeawKHb3rBY4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=pickle%20growers&f=false) ""Pickle Growers and Pickle Makers"" without mentioning cucumbers by name as the crop grown. The 1898 Proceedings of the Ohio Horticultural Society [referred to](https://books.google.com/books?id=OhE8AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA96&dq=%22pickle+harvest%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOuPqFr9nqAhVMWq0KHWAICEwQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q=%22pickle%20harvest%22&f=false) the ""pickle harvest"". An 1899 issue of *The Christian Advocate* [made clear](https://books.google.com/books?id=PzQxAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA19-PA33&dq=pickle+growers&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBrLPrstnqAhUMeawKHb3rBY4Q6AEISzAF#v=onepage&q=pickle%20growers&f=false) that ""pickles"" was used synonymously with ""small cucumbers"". 

There are many other instances from the time period where clarification *is* given, but the fact that it was not always done lends some evidence that ""pickle"" was already being understood as a pickled cucumber outside of the Northeast by the last quarter of the 19th century."

Hard to tell what's survived besides some of the substance of the telegram itself:

""On March 26, Stoeckl sent a long coded message to the Russian foreign minister to summarize the terms he and Seward had reached. These included the precise definition of the territory; the rights of the Russian citizens in the territory (either to stay and become American citizens or to return to Russia); the transfer process; and the price of $7 million. “I send this telegram,” he wrote, “at the request of Seward who pays for it and who said to me that he has met with great opposition in the cabinet because of the sum agreed on and that for the affair to succeed it will be necessary to make haste and have the treaty confirmed by the Senate which is to sit for two weeks longer.”""

"Prior to the 15th Amendment, voting was almost entirely something with the purview of the individual states, and even afterwards, states still retained some leeway in the mechanics of voting, which includes registration^1 . As such, there is no singular answer here, as different states did things differently, but we can at least talk about a few trends, focusing on the South as it is the region I am most familiar with, and with the caveat that I would *not* firmly state this applies equally to northern states, where the process might have been quite different.

To start with, as you seem to suspect, voting didn't always require registration as we think of it today. In the early days of the Republic, voting was a very public, very community oriented act. White men would go to the polls where their eligibility would be decided by the election officials - often the elite and the 'up-and-comers' of the region - their identity affirmed by the community around them. The ballot they would then cast was public. A very basic form of registration did exist in most jurisdictions but it was often the most perfunctory of processes, simply a county official writing up a list of names, and most likely if you *weren't* on that list you would still be able to vote as long as you were recognized by the community. Some states did maintain certain property requirements for certain elections, in in such cases there would be need to demonstrate eligibility, but on the whole it remained a very simple process. In any case, these lists were not overly important to the election process, the most common use simply being to have a number of eligible voters to compare the election returns to at the end of the day to determine turnout (or in rare cases, fraud). 

The process could feel somewhat hostile, and in all fairness, it kind of was intended to be. This being the days before the Australian (Secret) Ballot, ones vote was known to the community, and was cast under the watchful eyes of ones betters. In the rural south, often the polling place itself would be the plantation home of a local planter. Christopher Olsen describes the electoral process, and the implicit pressures that voters faced, wonderfully in the following passage, which I believe also helps shed light on the idea of identity at the polls too:

>Naturally, the board [of police] chose Squire [William] Vick and fellow planters Christopher Field and Dr. Jon J. Ross as election-day inspectors. Neighbors since [Bolivar] county's early days, all three men lived along the river near Bolivar's Landing. This triumvirate sat in judgement on prospective voters, allowing or challenging their rights to democratic privileges. No matter how often the inspectors exercised their authority, the symbolic effect of the setting must have been impressive. As they walked through the gate and approached Vick's front veranda, some voters surely understood the realities of wealth and power displayed there. Casting ballots under the nose, even the watchful eyes, of the county's greatest patrons, young farmers and new residents like A.H. Brice, who had recently arrived from Louisiana with his wife and little else, quickly learned who matters in the neighborhood. [...] 

>Once authorized to vote, each man handed his ballot to William E. Starke Jr., the returning officer. Then only 22, Starke already owned thousands of dollars worth of cotton land and over 30 slaves. He was also Peter Starke's nephew. The elder Starke [was a state senator and close friend of Vick]. Moving down the line, each voter gave his name to one of the clerks seated nearby: Robert E. Starke, Peter's son, or Dr. Ross's son John Jr. The implications of such an arrangement could scarcely have escaped most voters, or those seated as inspectors and clerks. For a man unfamiliar with the local power structure, casting his ballot on Vick's porch with the next generation of leadership on hand to learn the routine effectively showed him his place.

This slice of life, from election day in 1855, shows several things, I hope. First, how eligibility was enforced within the community. They first had to face the three inspectors, the most powerful men in the area, who had the right to challenge their eligibility in the first place, and from there, they then had to openly cast their ballot in view of the young scions of the county. Variations of this system could be found in other southern states to one degree or other, and allowed the easy perpetuation of the local oligarchies that controlled much of the region. Although generally seen as less corrupt, similar systems were not unusual in the North either, where voting too was a hyper-local community ritual (I won't digress, but [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5e5cub/how_were_overseas_american_soldiers_ballots/da9ru5f/) I discuss absentee balloting during the Civil War, and the reluctance to allow any form of voting that was not done in person). Various, basic forms of registration may have existed, but the core part of voter identification was simply being there in person, and known by those around you.

But then that whole Civil War thing happened, and that kinda changed things. The herrenvolk democracy became threatened by the end of slavery and enfranchisement of the freedmen, who often could form powerful voting blocs in some areas where they well outnumbered their former enslavers, and resulting, for a brief time, African-American elected officials at every level of government in the South, right up to the US Senate. But of course, this was short lived and the end of Reconstruction signaled the death knell. It is in the post-Emancipation, post-Reconstruction period, and especially the rise of the Jim Crow regime, that we begin to see stricter requirements for voter registration. This was something that was, in fact, anticipated in the drafting of the 15th Amendment, but those who supported more expansive protections failed to win out. Whereas the Amendment as ratified read:

>The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

Earlier proposed wording included:

>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall deny or abridge to any male citizen of the United States of the age of twenty-one years or over, and who is of sound mind, an equal vote at all elections in the State in which he shall have his actual residence, such right to vote to be under such regulations as shall be prescribed by law, except to such as have engaged, or may hereafter engage, in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, and to such as shall be duly convicted of infamous crime.

or alternatively:

>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge or deny to any male citizen of the United States of sound mind and twenty-one years of age or upward the equal exercise, subject to such registration laws as the State may establish, of the elective franchise at all elections in the State wherein he shall have actually resided for a period of one year next preceding such election, except such of said citizens as shall engage in rebellion or insurrection, or who may have been, or shall be, duly convicted of treason or other infamous crime.

Including stronger, more specific language, however, was supported by a small, radical group of Republicans, and without compromises within the party, attaining the necessary 2/3 support would have been impossible. In the end this forced the radicals to back the moderates preferred language, which aside from race, left requirements for suffrage to the states, including registration and criminal history. Tragically, these inclusions would not only have provided a framework for preventing the sorts of onerous registration or eligibility requirements that came after the end of Reconstruction, but also prevented disenfranchisement for most felons, another form of voter suppression that was used primarily against African-Americans convicted, rightly or wrongly, of petty crimes. Protecting race, but allowing nominally race-neutral prohibitions might have been closer to the victory moderates wished for *if* Reconstruction had succeeded, but in reality it was a hollow victory at best. The resulting final draft was an ""*ambiguous commitment to the black franchise*"", and its failures would soon be happily exploited to the joy of the white elites of the South, and the detriment to the black, and poor white, populations there for nearly a century. The result, you can probably already guess, but in any case was quite predictable. 

With the end of Reconstruction and the triumph of 'Redeemer' governments, just about any possible barrier to the voting by African-Americans was implemented. Most famous, perhaps, being literacy tests, but plenty of other mechanisms, including more expansive registration requirements that could be a bureaucratic quagmire for even a quite literate person to navigate, such as requiring documentation of voting history, and subjective tests that could be failed at the whim of the man conducting them. Even though they were clearly targeted primarily at the black population, being *as written* race neutral (the laws, after all, did impact many poor whites, a not-unwelcome byproduct for the white elites), the laws didn't violate the 15th Amendment as passed, although whether courts would have been forceful in upholding the Constitution with the draft language we can only speculate, given that even the ratified language was hardly well enforced (See Giles v. Harris or US v. Cruishank, among others), and registration requirements were waived or ignored in many cases for white persons, such as small-time felons, or with blanket ""Grandfather Laws"" which ensured that they needed to meet *none* of the requirements, essentially."

"Having a Shakespeare play helps!

The most direct answer is ""he adopted Octavian"" who ultimately came out on top of the tumult of the Late Republic and thus gave the family name ""Caesar"" to his successors. Augustus was himself active in promoting Julius Caesar's posthumous reputation, although of course in the Roman world Augustus was always the more important.

Beyond that, the last century or so of the Republic was generally considered a very exciting time with colorful figures, a Caesar forms a sort of capstone to it (for example, of the twenty Roman biographies in Plutarch, thirteen are of the period beginning with the Gracchi). Giving an exact reason why particular periods are so prominent in popular imagination is always going to be difficult to explain rather than justify--to give a comparison, why is the Tudor era so prominent in British history? You can give justifications: Shakespeare, the drama of the English Reformation, beginning of the overseas empire, the Spanish Armada, etc. But you could *also* give justifications for why, so the period of the Civil Wars, Commonwealth, and Restoration could be just as dramatic--you have Milton, the wars themselves, the cloak and daggers intrigue of the Commonwealth, the enigmatic figure of Cromwell, etc. Some periods--the Three Kingdoms in China, the the early Medici in Florence, the piracy of the late 1600s, etc--tend to ""stick"".

And of course fame tends to snowball. Because Caesar was famous, individual stories about him could be told and retold in various different ways for various purposes. His capture by the pirates is the ultimate example of keeping it cool, calm, collected, his assassination is either the acme of treachery or a stirring example of taking arms against tyranny, he can be woven into the national myth making of France and Britain. And the more these references are used, the more they can be used, and the more of an icon Caesar would become.

I strongly recommend Maria Wyke's *Caesar: A Life in Western Culture* which takes various episodes in his life and shows how they have figured into culture in later periods, from Caesar as chivalric ideal to Caesar and Cleopatra decadence and luxury giving name to a Las Vegas casino."

"I do agree that he was successful in capitalizing on luck, especially in his foreign policy negotiations. 

Although even there, there's a lot of nuance, as I keep thinking of how the Reykjavik Summit basically reached no tangible agreement (and arguably missed a big arms reduction agreement), in no small part because of Reagan's insistence on retaining SDI, yet in a broader sense the talks were a breakthrough in the US-Soviet relationship (and led to further, more successful talks, plus the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty). So there's a really weird thing where Reagan was able to capitalize on luck and build a strong working relationship with Gorbachev, while *also* sometimes getting in the way of his own relationship-building.

Although I was actually also thinking of Bush's skepticism regarding Gorbachev, and his foreign policy pause. The fact that Bush and Gorbachev were eventually able to also build a working relationship makes me feel like if anything it's an example of how much legwork Gorbachev was doing in the US-Soviet relationship towards defusing tensions though."

"You said during, so I'll try to keep the focus as contemporary as possible to the siege. Nevertheless, I only found one opinion poll taken from before the lethal ending to the Waco Siege and that only polled Waco residents, a small and obviously not-representative sample of the US population. Further, in [this series of polls](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-govt-covered-up-waco/), it's interesting to see how radically public opinion shifted against the government as the nineties progressed.

To clarify the ""large segment"" who supported David Koresh and the Branch Davidians, I found three opinion polls taken from April 1993. 

70% of people polled supported the government's actions at Waco, versus 27% who opposed it according to [the ABC Poll from 1993](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-govt-covered-up-waco/). 

[A poll from the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/us/death-in-waco-washington-memo-a-strategy-of-openness-aims-to-avert-backlash.html?mcubz=2) found 8 out of 10 Americans believed David Koresh was responsible for the deaths at Waco.

And finally, a poll taken from the [Waco Tribune Herald (footnote 5)](http://www.stateofformation.org/2012/06/“not-the-jesus-i-love-waco-residents-perception-of-the-branch-davidian-conflict-by-janet-jensen) has only fifty percent of locals supporting government action against the Branch Davidians, though 82% supported the government's ending of the siege.

As detailed in both the CBS poll and Gore Vidal's *Decline and Fall of the American Empire* those who opposed the actions of the FBI and ATF were largely hostile to what they perceived as government overreach. They saw the Branch Davidians as harmless, ""minding their own business,"" and not doing anything that should provoke the violent repression meted out by the federal besiegers. The fact that it was families pitted against heavily armed troopers with armored personnel carriers and tanks made for pretty poor optics regardless of whose side one took. 

The first, ostensible reason given by the Clinton Administration for infiltrating the BD Compound was to seize illegally held arms, a stick in the eye for Americans who hold the Second Amendment dear. When the agents assigned to this mission were repulsed and the situation began to heat up, George Stephanopoulos, the White House Communications Director changed the narrative to one of trying to save the children sequestered with their families. Against this claim, Pastor Robert McCurry points out that [this was an illegitimate use of federal force](http://www.islandone.org/Politics/Waco.McCurry.html) given that child protection falls under state jurisdiction. McCurry, well attuned to the limits of legitimate force, rails against what he sees as a monstrous attack by the government against its people. 

Remember, this is less than a year after the ""[Ruby Ridge Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Ridge?oldformat=true)"" during which a shootout between government agents and a family fleeing the law left a US Marshal, a mother, and a son killed. That event garnered quite a bit of sympathy for the family caught in the crossfire and among certain people, predisposed them against the kind of government ""repression"" that occurred at Waco. Both Ruby Ridge and Waco were precipitated by Firearms charges and involvement by the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms). Given the Second Amendment and the mythology of private gun ownership enabling the American Revolution and protecting ""Liberty,"" the federal government's perceived use of violence to monopolize its control of domestic firearms in these two instances rattled certain segments of the population.

"This is a great response.

"Though it is not precisely on your topic, while you wait for one more exactly tailored to your interest, I think you may be interested in a long response by /u/Kelpie-Cat that covers rising interest in whales and the see through Jacques Cousteau, *Flipper*, recorded humpback whale songs, and the ""Save the Whales"" movement in a majestic three-part post which almost no one saw:

 * [Why are whales associated with cosmos so much?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kp0w4x/why_are_whales_associated_with_cosmos_so_much/)

The only two things I'll add to that is that I think it's clear that:

1) I'm taking it for granted that whales (and dolphins) are at the core of the marine biology, but that is my subjective assessment. I don't think it's a coincidence that in the *Seinfeld* episode where George Constanza pretends to be a marine biologist (Season 5, Episode 14 ""The Marine Biologist"", original air date February 10, 1994), for example, culminates in the fraud George having to go and save a literal whale.

2) We can pretty definitively say that *Free Willy* is an effect and not cause of the interest in marine biology. If you track Google N-grams for Jascques Cousteau, save the whales, and marine biologist, [in the general English corpus](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=marine+biologist%2CJacques+Cousteau%2Csave+the+whales&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3) marine biologist has a local peak in 1973 (probably related in part to Jacques Cousteau) and then just continued to gain steam through the 1990s. However, if you look specifically [in the English-language fiction corpus](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=marine+biologist%2C+Jacques+Cousteau%2C+save+the+whales&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=27&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cmarine%20biologist%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CJacques%20Cousteau%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csave%20the%20whales%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2Cmarine%20biologist%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CJacques%20Cousteau%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csave%20the%20whales%3B%2Cc0) (which I would contend might better reflect the popular culture because it doesn't include strictly scientific works), you see mentions of ""marine biologist"" have a local peak slightly earlier, around 1990-1991, before the May and August 1992 shooting dates and  July 1993 release of *Free Willy*, and that the mentions decline through most of the 1990's before having another peak in the early 2000's.

[Note: how Google N-Grams work is that it collects track every usage of a word/phrase in the whole Google Books corpus, which is a significant portion of everything published in English, and then divide it by the total number of words that year. It does a pretty good job of tracking the word's popularity. Google has separate corpora for English, British English, American English, English fiction, and several other languages.]

Edit: A couple people have commented and pointed out other cultural texts, most notably *Star Trek IV: the Voyage Home* from 1986 (about time traveling to save the whales) and *Discovery Channel*’s initiation of “Shark Week”in 1988, as well as its other marine biology documentaries. I think both again are simultaneously products of and perpetuators of the dynamics that started earlier, back in the 60's and 70's, which /u/Kelpie-Cat covered well. 

In the case of *Star Trek IV*, they’re obviously literally traveling back in time to save the whales, an obvious reflection of the aims and worries “Save the Whales” movement which they documented. Likewise, Shark Week was apparently originally ""[heavily devoted to conservation efforts and correcting the kinds of misconceptions about sharks that *Jaws* helped to spread.](https://theweek.com/articles/444542/history-shark-week-how-discovery-channel-both-elevated-degraded-sharks)"" It was at the time one of a number of “stunt weeks” on the Discovery Channel. There was also a “Space Week”, for instance, among others. Apparently in part because of its resonance with these larger cultural trends (and I’d wager in part because of the unique take on these trends: sharks rather than whales and dolphins, an implicitly male focus, and also obviously drawing on/in conversation with the legacy of *Jaws*), Shark Week was the one the etched itself in the cultural brain. For the start, it was a success, apparently [doubling the typical prime time ratings for the channel](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/82153/10-bite-sized-facts-about-shark-week).

Though /u/Kelpie-Cat briefly mentions him, I recommend the NPR podcast *Invisibilia*'s segment on Roger Payne for a little bit more on the origin of recordings of humpback whale songs, and how they played directly into conservation efforts and the Save the Whales movement: ""[Two Heartbeats a Minute](https://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/812703083/two-heartbeats-a-minute)."" (I believe this is the podcast I've been thinking of—the description is frustratingly vague and there's no transcript.)"

Your question is loaded in two ways. First, it presumes that global opinion drove the UN General Assembly to condemn Zionism in resolution 3379. Second, it refers to an amorphous ""global opinion,"" which risks simplifying the issue and ignoring the many different points of view on Israel, Palestine, and Zionism that existed in both 1975 and 1991.

But if we read your question charitably, we might word it like this: Why did the UN adopt a resolution calling Zionism ""a form of racism and racial discrimination"" in 1975 only to revoke it less than two decades later?

The UN adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1963. This human rights instrument flatly condemned discrimination on the basis of ""race, colour, or ethnic origin."" By this point, [Israel had already been a member of the UN for around twenty years](https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/83E8C29DB812A4E9852560E50067A5AC). But in the period between Israel's admittance to the UN and the adoption in 1975 of resolution 3379, several armed conflicts occurred: the Suez Crisis, the Six Day War, and the Yom Kippur War, to name a few. Tensions rose and kept rising between the Jewish inhabitants of Israel, the Muslim Palestinians who lived there, and the nearby established military powers.

Israel served as a focal point for the wider conflict and global rivalries of the Cold War. The United States and the Western Bloc largely supported Israel, while the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc largely opposed it. Of the seventy-two states that supported the resolution, a large proportion belonged to the Eastern Bloc; the thirty-five states against, however, consisted mostly of western nations aligned with the United States. A further thirty-two states abstained from the vote. But GR 3379 cannot be explained solely by the Cold War and the worldwide tug-of-war between American and Soviet interests. Why, then, did so many African states vote for the resolution? Why so many Latin American states?

For the African states, here's the short of it: apartheid. [The resolution itself](https://web.archive.org/web/20121206052903/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761C1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1) made three explicit references to South Africa's notorious system of racial segregation. First, it quoted a document composed that year at the World Conference of the International Women's Year that called for the elimination of ""colonialism and neo-colonialism, foreign occupation, Zionism, apartheid and racial discrimination in all its forms""; second, it quoted a resolution adopted by the Organization of African Unity stating that ""the racist regime in occupied Palestine and the racist regimes in Zimbabwe and South Africa have a common imperialist origin, forming a whole and having the same racist structure\[.\]"" Finally, and most prominently, it referred to a prior GA resolution against the ""unholy alliance between South African racism and Zionism."" These paragraphs drew a direct connection between South African apartheid and Zionism and equated them as imperialist and racist ideas. [In its article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/12/17/un-repeals-resolution-linking-zionism-to-racism/70349a7c-ae07-40ea-b37d-ee711e0636eb/) on the 1991 revocation of GR 3379, the Washington Post put it simply: ""Many of the \[states voting for GR 3379\] were African countries that wanted the support of the others for U.N. moves against the apartheid system of racial separation in South Africa."" In other words, the issue of Israel and Palestine had turned into such a political flashpoint that some African delegations thought that voting together would give them enough influence to sway the UN against apartheid. This explanation seems to glaze over the actual feelings African states had about Israel -- maybe someone with more insight into 1970s African politics can jump in here -- but it makes sense.

What about Latin America? The Cuban and Brazilian arguments during [the debates for resolution 3379](https://ecf.org.il/media_items/1396) \-- which, by the way, is a fascinating read -- are telling. Cuba spent some time drawing a distinction between Zionism and Judaism, pointing to the rifts within the larger Jewish community about the establishment of the state of Israel and Zionism's continuation beyond that goal, and it went to great lengths to compare Israel with the colonialism that Cuba once fought against. Brazil made many of the same points: Zionism had run its course, and the connection between ethnicity and Israeli citizenship -- Cuba used the Law of Return to illustrate this argument -- is essentially a form of racial discrimination. But pay close attention to the arguments of the states that ultimately abstained, especially Kenya. Its delegation complained that no one had actually *defined* Zionism or clearly explained its connection to racial discrimination: ""Indeed, apart from expressions of anger or sometimes insults . . . what has been going on \[here\] sheds little or no light at all on the subject \[of Zionism\]."" This followed a decision by the General Assembly not to delay voting on the resolution pending a study into Zionism and its effects. Some of the states that ultimately abstained had voted for this delay. Mauritius lamented that many of the ""small"" nations at the UN had caved to the influence of the ""larger"" ones, probably referring to the U.S. and the USSR. It criticized the Western Bloc's hardline stance against the states in support of the resolution and chastised the other side for the same reasons.

So... what changed?

Ask yourself what else was happening in global politics in 1991 and you will have part of the answer. The Soviet Union was on its way out, rapidly opening itself to foreign influence and heading towards dissolution. The once-unified Eastern Bloc had deteriorated and no longer had the political capital to overcome regional politics and internal conflicts. In 1975, ""in an effort to curry favor with the Arabs and embarrass the United States, Moscow took the lead in pushing through the statement on Zionism,"" [as the New York Times put it](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/17/world/un-repeals-its-75-resolution-equating-zionism-with-racism.html); in 1991, that kind of collective effort -- and the USSR's international arm-wrestling match with the U.S. -- could no longer continue. This time, 111 nations voted for resolution 46/86, which would revoke GR 3379. Only twenty-five voted against it.

">  there are no reported documents that are widely internationally recognized as showing intent for genocide.

It is worth mentioning that article II of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* has recently been legally interpreted and case law produced by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda: 

That because of its nature, genocidal intent is not usually susceptible to direct proof and thus in the absence of explicit, direct proof, genocidal intent may therefore be inferred from relevant facts and circumstances. 

That the specific genocidal intent may be inferred from certain facts, including but not limited to the general context of the perpetration of other culpable acts systematically directed against that same group, whether these acts were committed by the same offender or by others, the scale of atrocities committed, their general nature, the fact that the victims were deliberately and systematically chosen on account of their membership of a particular group, the political doctrine which gave rise to the acts referred to, the repetition of destructive and discriminatory acts, the perpetration of acts which violate the very foundation of the group or considered as such by their perpetrators, the physical targeting of the group or of their property, the use of derogatory language toward members of the targeted group, the methodical way of planning, the systematic manner of killing, the number of group members affected, the relative proportionate scale of the actual or attempted destruction of a group and that genocidal intent need not be formed prior to the commission of genocidal acts, but must be present when committed.

> denial of the Armenian Genocide lies in the motives for the killings.

Also worth mentioning that the same courts have interpreted that intent is different from motive. That motive is not an element of genocide and that other motives do not preclude genocidal intent. Whatever may be the motive for the crime (land expropriation, national security, territorial integrity, etc.), if the perpetrators commit acts intended to destroy a group, even part of a group, it is genocide.

While we welcome all users who wish to try their hand at any area of history, answers do need to be based on a certain level of expertise/research in order to stand."
"The German Left was split between the Social Democrats, which had broad appeal, and more extreme factions. This radical-left went through a series of parties. First the Spartacus League formed soon after the end of the First World War. When one of their strike/demonstrations pulled more than half a million participants the more revolutionary among them launched an attempt to overthrow the government. The Spartacist Uprising in 1919 didn't go so well between the anti-communist paramilitary force known as the Freikorps (mostly great war veterans who'd walked off with their military equipment) and a government that was still more in charge than it seemed at the time.

Later, a Communist Party formed. But, it was torn between people who wanted violent overthrow of the government and those who wanted to democratically enact communism. There was constant infighting at the top, which led the party line to lurch unpredictably and damped the ability of the party to really recruit during the early 1920's. The most extreme left was badly undercut with Polish victory in the Polish-Soviet War, after which it was clear that military assistance from Russia wasn't coming. 

But, just because the Soviets couldn't get troops to Germany didn't mean that they couldn't get money and experts there. With a bit of outside support and a definitive winner in the hierarchy of the allowed the party to be one of the largest and most influential non-Russian communist parties, often polling around 10%.

Still, the Communist Party won 13% of the vote in 1932. Added to the 18% won by the Social Democrats they outnumbered the Nazis in the Reichstag. But, the two parties never really worked out their issues to form the center of a coalition that could rule, in no small part that the Communist Party was following the line of ""Social Fascism"" which argued that the Social Democrats were secret Fascists because they didn't want to do away with the free market immediately. Though, that position was bolstered by the fact that the Social Democrats were often in power at the provincial level when the Communists launched their attempted revolutions and often were in charge of the police that suppressed revolutionary movements. There was even an attempt in Prussia (where Social Democrats were strongest) of coordination between Communists and Nazis to oust them by plebiscite, which convinced the leadership of the Social Democrats that there wasn't a lot of difference between Red and Brown."

"It's just frowned upon, but has created controversy a few times. 

Many female leaders & first ladies have worn colors other than black to meet the Pope and, even though royalty and US First Ladies both usually follow tradition, it is no longer binding. Raisa Gorbachova wore red, which caused a bit of a scandal, but even Queen Elizabeth has worn lilac, and the Vatican itself pointed out that the dress code was no longer binding after a priest criticized the President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, for wearing green to a papal audience in 1997.  

A woman wearing white without being accorded the privilege is more controversial than wearing other colors, but has been allowed with the main consequence just being social criticism. 

The example that comes to mind is Cherie Blair, the wife of PM Tony Blair, wearing white to an audience with Pope Benedict XVI in 2006 - it seemed like she was trying to pass herself off as royalty and both the tabloids and opposing politicians pointed out that she seemed to think rather highly of herself to make that choice.

But a month ago, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, met the Pope wearing a pale gold dress and overcoat that looked almost white, and no head covering, and the commentary was much kinder. Instead of criticizing her, the media outlets that covered just took that angle that Pope Francis must be relaxing the dress codes and not rigidly enforcing them. She did wear the traditional black dress and mantilla in 2009 when she met with Pope Benedict XVI.

Scandinavia was not an isolated and remote corner of the Medieval World, not in the 10th century AD, not in the 7th century, not in the 12th century, and so on, this goes for Eastern Europe as well, if not even more so.  Scandinavia was plugged into numerous systems and institutions that spanned the Medieval world, and we can break these down into different systems, but I am going to focus on two in particular.  These two systems broke across cultural and ethnic barriers and facilitated the movement of money, goods, and of course people.

**Trade**

Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, defining it as modern day Ukraine, the Baltic countries, and western Russia (broadly) were the site of an important trade network.  This ""Varangian"" route that terminated in the trading centers of Scandinavia such as Hedeby and Birka was the end point of a trade route that extended from Northern Europe to the Middle East.  Goods such as silver, slaves, furs, wood, textiles, and other goods moved across the rivers and seas that separated these regions, and despite the vast geographic distances that were at work, the Scandinavians were an active part of the trade world of the Middle East, the Roman Empire, and Eastern Europe.  Goods and people moved from England to as far as India and back in this Medieval trade system, and the Norse people formed an integral part of it.  Indeed, the Norse world formed one giant system of mediation from the North Sea world that connected Iceland, Greenland, the British Isles, and the Low Countries to places like India, Western Asia, Byzantium, and Mesopotamia. 

This was done by the use of the rivers and waterways that formed the nucleus of long distance trade in this time period.  Eastern Europe and Scandinavia were not as well developed with infrastructure like you would see in the Middle East or the Mediterranean world.  Road systems for example were poorly maintained and local in nature, there were no highways that connected Scandinavia to the Middle East, it was all done through riparine travel.

This is evidenced by the presence of large amounts of goods such as Islamic silver coins that have been found in Scandinavia and even farther into Britain, [and these coins turn up quite often](http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44540000/jpg/_44540089_arabcoins226index.jpg) in a variety of contexts.  The movement of goods and peoples has also been documented in literary sources such as that of Ibn Fadlan, an Arabic traveler who wrote accounts of the people that he encountered in what is today southern Russia and Ukraine.  Now it is worth mentioning that a great deal of this trade would have been done by a series of intermediaries.  Swedish varangians might have traded slaves and fur in western Asia or the Roman Empire, which would then be traded onto farther areas, or they would use Islamic silver to purchase goods from Francia or Ireland.  Sometimes this would take the form of large trading expeditions, but trade would also be undertaken by the various groups who lived *on the way* between these various centers of trade.

So what does this mean for the distribution of people along these trade routes?  That there would have been relatively common movement of traders from places like Scandinavia moving in Western Asia trade circles and likely vice versa as well.  Not every Islamic trading movement was as well documented as Ibn Fadlan's journey, but it is quite likely that there were Arab merchants moving along the routes as well as Norsemen.  There were likely Greek, Armenian, Georgian, and other groups of people from the Roman Empire who also were established along these trade routes.  Crime for example was in the orbit of the Roman Empire and had Greek communities living in it, and trying to describe the tremendous diversity of the Medieval Roman Empire is well beyond the scope of a post on reddit.  This turned places like Eastern Europe into a relatively fertile area for new communities to arise.  Peoples such as the Rus, Bulghars, and so on were exposed to trade and ideas coming from both directions of this trade system and the mixture of Greek, Norse, and Arabic culture that popped up along the way between these trading hubs. 

Nor should we conceive of these as exclusively Eastern/Northern phenomena.  During the reign of Charlemagne there were embassies between Francia and the Abbasids of the Middle East that also resulted in the movement of goods, including an elephant of all things that found its way to Charlemagne's court, as well as people who moved between the two areas.  The situation in Northern Europe was hardly different.

**Religion**

The other great mover of people in the Medieval world was the Church.  The Latin Church for example was responsible for a tremendous movement of people around the western European world, and the Greek Church and the Islamic world were scarcely different.  It was through institutions like the church that Frankish figures ended up in Byzantium, or Africans in Britain, or Byzantines ended up in modern day Ukraine.

In particular the ties between the Rus and Byzantines were religiously informed, as well as tied to practical trade arrangements and political situations.  

The conversion of the Rus to Christianity for example was a later development that built off of trade and connections that went back centuries, in the 9th century the first missionizing movements came to the Rus from Byzantium, but this was hardly novel.  Centuries earlier missionaries like the Saints Cyril and Methodius had moved around what is today Ukraine and Russia attempting to convert the natives to Christianity, so the movement of Mediterranean figures into the depths of Eastern Europe was not novel.  There were several subsequent missionary movements that kept Christianity in the Rus homelands, despite at times lackluster support from the nobility.  Eventually the conversion took, due to confluence of political necessity as well as medieval power politics, and the Rus were brought into the orbit of the Greek Church.  The religions spread rapidly to the urban centers of the area and cities such as Kiev and Novgorod were converted in short order. 

This plugged the Rus lands into a network of religious institutions that were spread from Northern Russia, to the Balkans, to the Middle East, and within that institution, as in the Latin Church, there was a tremndous movement of people within its confines.  In particular the importance of Constantinople as an important economic and religious center kept ties relatively robust (though often not friendly at times) between the Rus and their successor states and the Roman Empire.  The mixture of peoples in Eastern Europe due to the Church and the various political developments of this time provided a relatively fruitful exchange of people between the Eastern Mediterranean and modern Ukraine and Russia.

Now there is much more that can be said here, particularly in regards to the ties between places like Sweden to the steppe peoples of eastern Europe, and the evidence of high ranking women who came from such places (and perhaps even bore weapons) but that is for someone who knows more about archaeology than I do.  There is also more to be said about the patriarchal nature of rulership in Scandinavia, though this is a rather different kettle of fish and I think its better suited to its own post.

So in short, would there be people of non-European extraction living in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe in the 10th century?  Undoubtedly."
"Hello!

This question has been asked before. 

/u/Finger_Trapz answered [Why did Communism almost always lead to dictatorships?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i0rfvn/why_did_communism_almost_always_lead_to/g00ybqb/)

"Is there any theorizing that it might be just intentionally silly and poking fun at glory-seeking knights? A snail is a comically unthreatening foe. Or is that too much of a contemporary ""nerds versus jocks"" perspective?"
Do you know anything about the analogous minor party systems in East Germany and North Korea or is that outside the scope of your research?
"The idea that a weapon would be banned in war but allowed domestically does come across as rather absurd. But like with many things, there is more nuance than might appear on the surface. 

Under the CWC tear gas falls into the category of ""harassing agents"" also known as Riot Control Agents or RCAs. During the long process that lead to the CWC RCAs were something that was subject to a fair bit of negotiation and debate. The main debate centered not so much around law enforcement, but on military use outside of warfare. For example when rescuing personnel from a downed aircraft when hostile civilians are present or dealing with hostile crowds at bases or embassies. There were countries that pushed for more strict bans or regulations, but the US took a hard line pushing for their use and even the modest restrictions in the CWC would be a sticking point in it's ratification in the Senate.

The final draft stated that “Each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare."" and contained a specific exemption for law enforcement. 

There were a few main justifications given for this discrepancy. 

The first is that in war things like tear gas are often used to increase effectiveness of other weapons i.e. a force multiplier. For example, you might use it to flush people out of a bunker so you can attack them. Or to force them into an area where they might be surrounded or encounter mines or other risks. This is, or ideally is, less of a concern when used domestically or in non-warfare situations. Dispersing a crowd is often an alternative to more lethal means, not an attempt to lead them into fire or harm. Without RCAs, the only option may be to use lethal force. 

RCA programs and delivery systems can also be used to cover for other chemical weapons. There is no easy way to tell if a projectile contains an RCA or a deadly gas or what a factory might be able to produce. This can lead to confusion or provide cover for more nefarious weapon development. If one combatant sees the other preparing chemical shells, they would have no way of knowing if it is tear gas or something like mustard gas. Warring parties are not exactly going to trust each other or assume the best.  In contexts outside of warfare this is less of a concern. 

The method of use is also much different. Law enforcement and non warfare use often involves small scale delivery systems. Even if they fell into the wrong hands, the harm they cause is limited. The use of RCAs in warfare often involves delivery systems that can spread it over a very wide area. A tear gas canister being fired into a crowd is going to cause some pain and discomfort, but people can generally get away to fresh air. A wide area weapon could blanket a city in gas giving people nowhere to go. Not allowing their use in warfare ideally would discourage the development of these systems. 

There is also concern that their use would lead to further escalation. This is basically what happened in WW1. The use of tear gas lead to more toxic gases and eventually to a horrific chemical arms race. This was despite a ban on poison gases in the 1899 Hague Convention. By banning all chemical weapons in war, the idea was to prevent such an escalation from beginning in the first place. Again, outside of warfare this is not really a concern.

"> And in the case of Olympus, there was actually a sanctuary of Zeus quite close to the top. From the third century BCE to the fifth century CE, offerings were made at an altar on Hagios Antonios, a peak about a mile from the main summit.

"> Since you refer to a general consensus between the historians of the two countries in the past 50-75 years, could you possibly, just for the sake of clarity, sum up what that consensus is?

That would be rather difficult to summarize in one short post.  The consensus that I am referring to can be found in many, many books. I was referring, broadly, the general narrative of the American Revolution.  Those narratives can be seen in books like, *American Revolutions: A Continental History, 1750-1804* by Alan Taylor or for those who have less time to read a lengthy book, *The American Revolution: A Very Short Introduction* by Robert J. Allison.  They discuss a lot of the themes and facts of the Revolution rather than charging into unknown territory.   That said, I'll try and summarize a few key points that I think historians of all backgrounds who study this period would agree with.

Broadly speaking, the American Revolution is viewed today as a social movement that originated with lower-class American colonists, but harnessed by the American gentry.  This movement was due, at least in part, over outrage against the British government in response to a lack of a political voice in the British government while having unfair (in their view) taxes imposed upon them.  This movement did not start out with the goal of becoming seperated from Britain, but snowballed into it during events of the mid 1770s. 

Was there any particular part of Revolutionary history that you'd more specifically want me to expand upon?

"The Secret Service did not start protecting the president full-time until after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901. The president would travel in public before this time with only a few aides or associates as a limited buffer against the public; in 1876, President Rutherford B. Hayes traveled to the exhibition in Philadelphia as a civilian alone. Five years later, President James Garfield was shot by Charles Guiteau at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington. Garfield was traveling by train to give a speech at Williams College and he was surrounded by the Secretary of State and Secretary of War and a few Washington city police officers.

">The technology to make mirrors began in the European Renaissance

Mirrors have a *much* longer history than this. Glass mirrors go back to the Roman period and were further developed by early medieval Islamic scientists. They could also be found among the aristocracy of Europe such as the Byzantines. They were high-status items but were relatively common among the elite. Reflection quality, while not as high as later mirrors, was good enough that mirrors commonly formed a rhetorical device for self-reflection, from the ""mirrors for princes"" genre to religious writers such as the 13th century Claire of Assisi. Mirrors form a common motif in Classical and medieval art, often depicted with women and appearing everywhere from Greek pottery to Pictish stones.

Before glass mirrors, polished stone and metal mirrors go back thousands of years. While they required frequent upkeep to maintain reflection quality, they were relied upon among the higher classes to perfect their appearances, such as in this [4th century Chinese painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror#/media/File:Histoire_de_femme_Gu_Kai_Zhi.jpg). These mirrors could also have important sacred significance, such as in Japan where the Yata no Kagami is one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan, representing wisdom, a tradition dating back to the 7th century AD."
"You are quite right that the Campus Martius was exceptionally flood-prone; during especially bad inundations (according to the Liber Pontificalis) the raging current undermined whole rows of ancient apartment buildings, sending them crashing into the muddy water. People concentrated in the Campus largely because one of the more reliable aqueducts brought water there. The spiritual and economic pull of the Vatican, right across the river, also surely contributed.

Silt would certainly have collected more thickly in the Campus Martius than in many other parts of the city. Since the area was still inhabited, however, the streets stood a better chance of being cleared - so I don't think soil deposition was noticeably quicker. 

In some parts of the city, the ruins were cleared / pushed around to make farming easier. The marble pavements of the imperial forums, for example, were lifted in the ninth century, apparently so that farms and orchards could be established on deeper soil. Elsewhere, there does not seem to have been a great deal of artificial leveling. The owner of one Renaissance vineyard established over the ruins complained about all the lumps on his property; when he finally decided to flatten the biggest one, he found a trove of ancient statues. 

Some people - mostly nobles - continued to live on the hills for a long time. As you suggest, however, aqueduct water tended not to reach that high anymore. And from the tenth century onward, as Rome's noble families began openly warring with one another, it was more secure to fortify the monumental ruins in the low-lying valleys."

"Unfortunately, I’m not a historian and I won’t be able to give you a broad answer to your question, but I do know about Irish folk songs, many of which date back to the 19th century or earlier. Also, since folk music was and still is performed at local celebrations like weddings or religious holidays, it reflects the tastes, if not the exact words, of everyday people.

Many songs specifically celebrate a “colleen” (from the Gaelic cailin, literally meaning “young girl”), who is a “country/peasant girl…associated with a rural landscape and way of life” (O’Conner, 2009). Take these lyrics from “Star of the County Down,” for instance:

From a boreen green came a sweet colleen  
And she smiled as she passed me by.  
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet  
To the sheen of her nut brown hair.  

In general, there is an emphasis on the beauty of the woman’s hair or eyes. Two other good examples are “The Black Velvet Band”:

Her eyes they shown like diamonds  
I thought her the queen of the land  
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder  
Tied up with a black velvet band  

And, “The Rose of Tralee”:

She was lovely and fair as the rose of the summer,  
Yet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me;  
Oh no, 'twas the truth in her eyes ever dawning,  
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee.  

So, what general trends about beauty might you be able to draw from these examples? 

The descriptions tend to be metaphorical and naturalistic, connecting the woman and the landscape (“rose of the summer,” “queen of the land”). Also, the songs often emphasize that the women are from a specific place in Ireland – County Down is in Northern Ireland and Tralee is in County Kerry in Southwestern Ireland. I think this adds a patriotic flavor – these women are beautiful because they represent Ireland itself, forming a “national feminine ideal” (O’Conner, 2009). 

Therefore, the peasant man in your question may not have been pressured to value a narrow physical “type” of woman. Instead, he may have enjoyed praising beautiful women through song, or connecting specific women that he loved in his life to beauties described in song or to his love for his homeland.

"I'm not a historian, but a marketing academic, and I will try to speak to this question from that perspective. At a base level, this is a question of the effect of product placement. There is ample evidence for the effects of product placement, in the forms of increased recall and behavioral change (i.e. buying the product).

Addressing the Frasier-Starbucks placement directly, I poked around a bit and there are some academic papers that have tenuously made this connection, usually in a speculative or hand-waving fashion ([Russell and Stern 2006](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/JOA0091-3367350101), [Williams, et al. 2011](https://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/10712.pdf)). However, the Williams, et al. cite seems to be an example of an ""academic urban legend"" (per one of my favorite papers, [Rekdal \(2014\)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0306312714535679), where the authors of the later paper cited something without carefully examining the original sourcing of the claim in the Russell and Stern paper, which appears to be [Tueth \(2000\)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01956050009602829). The Teuth paper doesn't make this claim at all, and is instead about how 1990s situation comedies were frequently set in urban environments, such as New York City and Seattle and the cities become central elements of the plots.

That said, the lack of any empirical research testing your question doesn't really provide an answer to it. Addressing it would be quite difficult, though. The question as posed has an underlying causal claim - Frasier became popular, and the importance of Starbucks within Frasier led the viewers of Frasier to want to go to Starbucks and this increased its popularity. Supporting this, we have data that shows that concurrent with Frasier going on air, Starbucks had a large scale expansion - a correlation. But, as they say, this is not sufficient for us to make a causal claim. At least two other possibilities would also fit this data: that Starbucks made Frasier popular (""backwards,"" as you note), or that the forces driving the popularity of Frasier and the opening of Starbucks stores are unrelated but occurring at the same time. Teasing these processes apart is not trivial, and making a causal inference based on observational data at a macro level like this is a common problem in economics, political science and sometimes in my field as well. 

Fundamentally, this involves identifying some kind of counterfactual which we can compare with what we observe. One potential way this could be down would be to identify if there are communities that were not shown Frasier that we could compare against those that did have access to it, and see if these areas are less likely to be Starbucks outlets in those areas that were not exposed. It looks like the first reference to Starbucks in the show was in [season 1, episode 2](http://www.kacl780.net/frasier/transcripts/season_1/episode_2/space_quest.html), where Frasier says ""Hey, this isn't my coffee.  Where's my finely-ground Kenya blend from Starbucks?"" which first aired on September 23, 1993. Unfortunately, most of the media markets in the United States appear to have had NBC affiliates as of 1993 (per [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBC_television_affiliates_\(table\))), and those that didn't likely could get access from neighboring broadcast affiliates. Moreover, those markets that didn't have access are likely to be quite different from those that did - for one, they're smaller markets, and thus would be unlikely to be places where Starbucks would open anyways, so this won't help us differentiate a causal effect of Frasier from unrelated drivers (i.e. having a market of sufficient size).

There are certainly other methods that might be used to demonstrate this, but its unlikely that we'd be able to show anything that will definitively point at any of the three different causal pathways. As with any large scale phenomenon operating at the intersection of social forces and popular media, its probably a bit of all three. Starbucks and other espresso bars were already becoming reasonably popular in the United States prior to Frasier airing. See this [1992 NYT by Fabricant](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/02/garden/americans-wake-up-and-smell-the-coffee.html) article, introducing the masses of NYC to ""something called espresso.""
> This new coffee culture is catching on in New York, where pots of 90-cups-to-the-pound weaklings sit on warmers for hours on end. Virtually every New York restaurant, from the exalted to the expedient, now serves something called espresso, strong Italian-style coffee in small cups. In Manhattan alone, the number of new espresso bars, cafes and stands that offer hot and cold, regular and decaffeinated espresso-based drinks with names like caffe latte have risen in the last year, from only a few to more than a dozen.

Most likely, the writers of Frasier identified this cultural phenomenon that was already taking place,  and picked a brand that would be known to some of their audience but not to others, providing an ""in joke"" or reference that would require some cultural capitol to understand, especially prior to the widespread growth of the internet. Bringing this to a wider audience likely positively impacted the popularity of Starbucks - [27 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier_\(season_1\)) viewed S1E2 of Frasier, so it would be surprising if it didn't. However, I think that breaking down attribution of the growth of Starbucks to references on the show vs. the broader societal interest in coffee is probably not possible."
"This is a very generalized statement about methods of interpreting reconstructed visual culture based on my experience as an art historian who often has to propose reconstructions of either entire works or their ""original"" appearances:  


First, the bright flat color you see in reconstructions of the painting schemes on Classical sculpture is often a guess, or more accurately an estimation. In most cases these sculptures have very trace remains of pigment. It's almost impossible to get an accurate sense of what types of modeling (using color and light to suggest three-dimensionality) are at work on them. Pigments deteriorate under environmental conditions, and much of modeling in painting is an exercise in layering pigments and perhaps at time using different binders that remain intact only under particular circumstances (lack of humidity, or under water for example). By the time these sculptures are studied using contemporary methods, much of the evidence we have of their coloration has simply been lost to time. At best remaning pigment can be analyzed and identified scientifically. Art historians, curators, and conservators can then suggest an overall color that was applied to that area. 

Moreover, it was regular practice in the past to intentionally destroy valuable evidence of painting in works of classical art and architecture. Elizabeth S. Bolman notes in her [study](https://www.academia.edu/1100717/Late_Antique_Aesthetics_Chromophobia_and_the_Red_Monastery_Sohag_Egypt) of ""chromophobia"" in the historiography of Coptic art, 

>""The desire for whiteness was expressed both in copies of ancient buildings and through the physical transformation of the original surfaces themselves. William St. Clair has recently discovered definitive proof that when the Parthenon sculptures were being prepared for display in the British Museum in 1937-1938, many of them were chiseled and scoured to remove all traces of paint and patina, in an effort to render them completely white. This approach was not unique. A photograph taken in 1953 shows a “restorer” scraping the patina off of the marble surface of the Hephaesteion in Athens using a steel chisel, as part of a project undertaken by an American, Alison Frantz""

So it's not just that contemporary scholars are working with lost information, it's that in many cases the evidence for the sophistication of Classical painting on sculpture and architecture was deliberately destroyed and erased to prevent this very reconstruction. This physical erasure of color is a huge factor in why we have to guess as to what these sculptures originally looked like and make cautious suggestions that to us seem loud, flat, and maybe sort of ""bad"" in comparison to extant wall painting or panel painting with encaustic. The accepted practice within conservation and restoration in the 21st century is to not provide any reconstructions of material you don't have evidence for. So for example, when restoring a painting and coming to areas of loss, most conservators are trained to fill in the lost area with a neutral grey-brown pigment rather than fill in the subject matter or colors that they suspect could have appeared. This approach provides historical transparency by reconstructing only the elements or colors that we have physical evidence of. Over-restoration is considered by most professionals to be both academically misleading and damaging to the original object.

Second, our approach to color in the present is informed by so many things that were unavailable or not important to ancient people. We live in a world where we produce visual stimuli almost faster than we can consume it, including in the production of new colors and pigments for industry (see for example, Pantone's 'Color of the Year' marketing campaign. Or the development and use of new pigments such as Vantablack, which caused controversy when it was licensed exclusively to Anish Kapoor for artistic use). People in the pre-modern world, and in the pre-modern Mediterranean had access to a limited palette, but they also just seem to have really loved bright colors and varying patterns that did not depend on naturalism in all cases. In late antiquity this magpie-style aesthetic becomes known as [""The Jeweled Style,""](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Jeweled_Style/3etiAAAAMAAJ?hl=en) and even manifests in literature and poetry. 

We don't know why exactly ancient and medieval peoples loved bright tacky color and pattern so much, but we know they valued color for its vividness, its saturation, and its ability to bring a sense of ""lifelikeness"" (NOT realism, but more like vivacity) to otherwise stationary works like architecture and sculpture. You can see some of the best-preserved ancient architectural painting at the Red Monastery in Sohag, Egypt, where the aforementioned Professor Bolman directed a conservation campaign for over a decade. [Here is an image of the triconch apse prior to its cleaning and conservation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/RedMonasteryRight.jpg). And [here is an image of it afterwards.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Red_Monastery_Sohag_Egypt_Sanctuary_North_apse.jpg/1280px-Red_Monastery_Sohag_Egypt_Sanctuary_North_apse.jpg) The difference between the two is vast, and the bright and varied color of the original paint is very much in aesthetic contrast to what the apse looked like before, with overpainting, varnish, and soot that had accrued for centuries.

A similar reveal took place in the momentous restoration of the Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes from 1984-1994. Here is [a composite image showing the scene of Adam and Eve expelled from Eden](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Gardenbeforeandafter.jpg) before and after restoration. When the restoration was complete and the frescoes revealed, there was substantial controversy over the resultant color and shading. Art historians, artists, and art critics were horrified by the candy-brightness and almost pastel palette that emerged, particularly in light of what is known of Michelangelo's less than sunny disposition as an individual. Debate over this restoration continues, but the scholarly consensus based on careful comparative study of other restored work, textual evidence about color and aesthetics, and even economic information about pigments and textiles (textile inventories and regulations often give us much information about color) seem to support the flamboyant array of color that the restoration revealed.

In short, much of our assumptions about what color *should* look like are based on our own experience of color in modernity and our popular perceptions of whatever culture we're observing. The color we see *in actuality* often reveals less information about how specific works of art were colored, but tells us much about how the aesthetic preferences of their patrons, viewers, and creators can diverge greatly from our own."
"Great answer, thanks!"
"This is a great question and reasonable to ask if you’ve watched the musical.  As the musical shows, that by the time of Hamilton's death, he underwent both a serious scandal following his own publication of the [95-page Reynolds Pamphlet](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-21-02-0138-0002) and his multiple public confrontations between other leading figures, like Adams and Jefferson. However, Hamilton was still a very-well known figure and his death was seen as a huge shock to not only New Yorkers, but many Americans spread throughout the United States.

By his death in 1804, Alexander Hamilton was a very well-known figure across America. First made famous for his participation in the victory at Yorktown in 1781, Hamilton rose through the public ranks quickly through the 1780s and 1790s. His political and legal career also kept him constantly in the spotlight, both by friends and enemies typically through the press.  People knew him not only for these accolades, but also as someone who was profoundly influential in drafting the new US Constitution and also was well-respected by George Washington, whom everyone still adored. So the shock and sadness, as described in the musical wasn't only shared by people who supported Hamilton, but a general sense of horror that such a well-known figure could be killed in a duel.

As [Ron Chernow explains in his biography of Hamilton](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292945/alexander-hamilton-by-ron-chernow/), ""When a handwritten notice of Hamilton’s death went up at the Tontine Coffee House, the city was transfixed with horror... Even Burr’s friend Charles Biddle conceded that “there was as much or more lamentation as when General Washington died... Unlike at Washington’s death, however, the sorrow was laced with shock and chagrin at the senselessness of Hamilton’s demise.""(1)

Hamilton's death gripped Americans everywhere.  Newspapers ran headlines going over the unexpected death and church bells rung out in cities like Philadelphia and Boston to mourn his passing. As Chernow, and other biographers explained, many factors led to this outpouring of support. Among them, Hamilton was only 47* when he died, he left behind a young grieving family with many several children, his history of service to America echoed in people's minds and his painful end at the hands of the Vice President enabled Hamilton to finally, ""achieve in death what had so often eluded him in life: an emotional outpouring of sympathy from all strata of New York society.""(2)

Biographers describe New York in July, 1804 as being in grieving as a city because they lost their 'most distinguished citizen.' The New York Common Council urged all businesses to be closed on the day of his funeral, which turned into a huge spectacle. Not only was the crowds huge for the procession, but New York militia came out to bear arms and do military drum rolls and ships in the harbor few their sails at half-mast. Chernow explained, ""It was the grandest and most solemn funeral in the city’s history to date."" (3)

Ultimately, the musical didn't exaggerate that New Yorkers and Americans in general were shocked at Hamilton's unexpected death and openly grieved together. 

*Hamilton's date of birth is in dispute. Some sources believe he was born in 1755 and others in 1757, which means he was either 47 or 49 when he was killed.

"I'm having trouble understanding what point you are trying to make, as you seem have things rather flipped? I mean, I'm quite implicitly using the term ""infamous crime"" exactly as you seem to want it applied. My whole point there is that the draft only disenfranchised for ""infamous"" crimes and wouldn't disenfranchise Bob Smith if he was convicted of some minor offense like, say, vagrancy. To be frank, I think you are massively misreading the draft language here, given how *you* think it is supposed to be applied, since that clause was specifically to *provide* for, not *prevent* ""disenfranchisement of southern whites through convictions for crimes related to rebelling against the US during the civil war"". Let's edit out the extra words [emphasis mine]:

>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge or deny to any male citizen [...] of the elective franchise [...] **except** such of said citizens as shall engage in rebellion or insurrection, or who may have been, or shall be, duly convicted of treason or other infamous crime.

Or in short, only 'infamous' crimes, treason, rebellion, or insurrection would result in disenfranchisement, while petty crimes could not be grounds for it. It is very clearly stating that former Confederates can be disenfranchised for their actions.

In any case, you are certainly correct that there had been a history of disenfranchisement for *serious* crimes, but you are incorrect if you believe that criminal disenfranchisement wasn't ever looked at in racial terms prior to the passage of the 15th Amendment in 1870. We can definitely see a shift in the period between the end of the war and the passage of the 15th Amendment, generally, of course, in the tenor of the black codes passed, but a shift can start to be seen specifically in criminal disenfranchisement, most especially with Alabama, whose 1819 constitution allowed for disenfranchisement for ""bribery, perjury, forgery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors"", but changed this in their 1868 constitution to also include ""crime punishable by law with imprisonment in the penitentiary"", something which simply can't be understood outside of the context of the black codes, which, although now being struck down during Reconstruction, nevertheless held up a promise for future return, not to mention an existing history of conviction for many. It also wasn't like Northern authorities weren't  conscious of how criminal disenfranchisement could be potentially used, but in the end they were simply satisfied with laws that were written in a race-neutral way and deemed that sufficient, with several of the Acts of Re-admittance including language that [emphasis mine]:

>[Voting shall not be deprived] except as a punishment for such crimes as are now felonies at common law, whereof they shall have been duly convicted, **under laws equally applicable to all the inhabitants of said State**. 

This also can be read in the context of the 14th Amendment's 2nd Clause, which sought to punish disenfranchisement by not counting for apportionment of Representatives any persons disenfranchised *except* those guilty of ""participation in rebellion, or other crime"". Or in other words, depriving someone of their vote via conviction of a crime firmly, and decisively removes the franchise while ensuring there is no threat to apportionment. All taken together, there is good reason to argue that the desire to limit criminal disenfranchisement to only more serious - ""infamous"" crimes, if you will - that was advanced by some persons involved in drafting the Amendment was based in part on wanting to prevent the use of petty criminal convictions being used as a means of disenfranchisement in Southern states which had *already* begun to look in that direction prior to the ratification of the Amendment, although in the end only a small portion of legislators supported such language, of course, so it was not included in the end, and in any case disenfranchisement for *serious* crimes was resoundingly supported by nearly all. As with the acts of readmittance, while there is absolutely evidence that there was concern about the use of criminal disenfranchisement to disproportionately target black voters, legislators were satisfied with laws that were on the face race neutral even if they would not be so in application down the line.

So again, I'm not sure what you are really saying or how you are coming to the conclusions that you did. Certainly you have understood the application of the draft quoted to apply precisely in the wrong direction, and in any case, I'm definitely *not* claiming that the 15th Amendment was watered down *specifically to allow* criminal disenfranchisement of petty black criminals, but only that it was a byproduct of the final language used, even if unintended, and one foreseen by at least some people involved in the drafting process."
"Also worth noting that even before Pascal, there was a concept of an atmosphere and differences between certain altitudes. The idea of horor vacui, that nature abhors a vacuum, was not necessarily a objection to the idea that there is nothing breathable up there, but the idea that there is NOTHING up there.

Archimedes (3rd Century BC) wrote about refraction, that light is 'bent' when moving between media of different densities. Cleomedes (unknown, somewhere between 1st Century BC and 4th century AD) wrote about the illusion whereby the moon appears larger at the horizon than it does further from it, he reasoned that since water appears to magnify objects, there must be a denser, wetter region of air somewhere between the moon and the observer when it is at the horizon.

Ptolemy also studied the moon illusion and observed similar behaviour in stars, he proposed an atmospheric model whereby the Earth is surrounded by a concentric sphere of air of uniform density, and a sharp cutoff to the outside ether of much lower density.

Ibn Mu'adh in the 11th century wrote a brief work (which in many places is attributed to Alhazen since it appears in a work by Alhazen) calculates the depth of Ptolemy's atmosphere to about 86.3km. Not too bad since the modern boundary is the Karman line at 100km, which is the point where aeronautical flight becomes impossible.

All this to say that even in ancient times, it was known that there was something different up there, but not necessarily what it was.

"[2/2]

What we think of as ""mental illness"" (or your preferred term) today is really a web of symptoms, many of which occur in many cases. There's significant blurring of boundaries and ambiguity, both between named disorders and between, well, dysfunction and function.

Now, the most famous medieval example doesn't really apply to schizophrenia. That's Caroline Walker Bynum's revelation (an appropriate word, given its impact in scholarship) that severe food asceticism--not eating--was a significant aspect of the perception of medieval women's holiness in the late Middle Ages, in many cases, THE most important. One can in fact find references to some of the other physical signs (amenorrhea) and behaviors (secret binge eating) associated with the modern disease of anorexia nervosa. But medieval women's practice, while sharing a similar underlying *physical* etiology, occurred for vastly different reasons and was perceived by them and others entirely differently.

Historians of the medieval and early modern era have generally not seen the symptoms of schizophrenia translated in a neat and somewhat-self-contained package like that. (Some of the other signs of sanctity attributed to women with miraculous inedia would more commonly today be associated with depression, hence ""somewhat""). Basil Clarke, in his study of the prevalence of ""mental disorder"" in medieval England, put forth a paradigm that is helpful here, functionality. He argued that medieval people didn't recognize different disorders as acutely in lists of symptoms as we do, but rather by how thoroughly people were able to be integrated into everyday society--how well they functioned.

This perspective has good support from scholarship on the legal status of ""idiots"" (congential developmental/mental disability) and ""lunatics"" (mental disorder acquired later in life) in late medieval England, and also in an intriguing 17th century text by an English doctor named Thomas Willis. Willis studied what he called ""Stupidity"" and ""Foolishness,"" dividing them along the traditional lines of congenital and acquired. He lists different types of foolishness, one of which Paul Cranefield argues lines up very neatly with what we'd recognize as schizophrenia today. Winfried Schleiner has illustrated a similar phenomenon at work in theological and pastoral work from the sixteenth century. Obviously this is very much not medieval, but it's a good illustration of a continuity in perspective and of a functionality approach at work. 

That's also the framework historians apply to divine and diabolical visions. We don't judge the validity; we judge what people perceived and how they responded. And one of the things we detect in terms of the role of the devil and demons in visions is a *societal* shift over the course of the Middle Ages, though illustrated by individual examples. In the twelfth century, Hildegard of Bingen successfully performed an exorcism on a woman declared possessed. The most fascinating thing about this case (besides that it appears to be somewhat of a case of celebrity worship; the victim insisted that ONLY Hildegard could do it, and ONLY in person) is that the woman *was allowed to keep preaching the devil's message* in public until the exorcism.

This is a very different attitude than we see from men writing about holy women in the late fourteenth and fifteenth century, when they discuss the excessive, terrible torments that demons visit on them. (Think St. Anthony in the desert turned up to eleven, or twenty). What's important here are a couple of things. First, when women do their own writing, there are cases where this is a bigger deal (Christine von Stommeln) and noted in passing, easily defeated (Katharina Tucher). Second, these clerical authors are the ones reflecting and helping set the *societal* tone of increasing diabolism.

So there's a lot in the mix here, but we need to be very, very careful about pathologizing either individuals or society. I'll let /u/hillsonghoods talk about the history and historiography of mental illness to talk about [the science behind it, and why it matters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8v1865/many_people_who_suffer_from_paranoid/e1k1az2/)"
"Do you have any information on whether the work day actually used to be from 9 AM to 5 PM? It seems that must either include a paid lunch or be seven hours a day. Your response seems more like an analysis of the song and its intentions and context, rather than the OP's specific question, which was:

>Did people work one hour less in the 80s? How did we lose that hour? In other words did people used to get paid for lunch breaks and then somehow we lost it?

I don't speak for everyone, but personally I was mostly interested in that aspect of the overall working experience and whether or not the standard workplace added an hour per day at some point. It seems to me that OP was also asking this and just using the song as an example of the widespread use of the term. So basically what I'm asking is:

You've explained the connotations of the term ""9 to 5."" Can you explain why it is not ""8 to 5"" despite the fact that this is the more common workday in the present?"
"While I can't speak to the perspective of Pacific Anthropology specifically, it's safe to say that modern academics have a universally severe distaste for Thor Heyerdahl's ideas and his conjectures have not held up well in the 75-odd years since the Kon Tiki expedition. 

Heyerdahl was what we call a ""diffusionist"" and believed that all ""civilization"" ultimately came from a tribe of people out of the old world. These white-skinned, white-bearded supermen had crossed the atlantic and founded all the major civilizations of the Americas. Having become the ruling class of the Inka, they journeyed out to the pacific. Thereafter some Native Americans followed them and destroyed the enlightened Aryans, becoming stranded and regressing to primitivism.

Needless to say, this is nonsense. But, the expedition was impressive and the interest it attracted essentially launched the study of the Polynesian islands as a discipline in the public mind. Academics at the time were fairly accepting of his racism, but largely disagreed with his vehement assertions that polynesian settlement had been from the East rather than the West, as archaeology and linguistics clearly contradicted it."
"As an additional question on your response.

Twice you’ve mentioned that European powers needed to find ways of legitimising their rule in the New World, and alluded to the fact that they leaned on racial or cultural differences. My question is why did they need different reasons to rule from those used in Europe? After all, the Spanish Crown also ruled Milan, the Low Countries and Naples through this time period, in addition to the various non-Castilian Spanish kingdoms."

"That happened as a *de jure* recognition of the *de facto* situation on the ground in China for many years; namely, that the Communist Party of China was in control. If Russia's seat were to be switched in a similar fashion, it would have to be as a result of the Russian government being driven to exile or to lose almost all of its territory to a Russian uprising. The UN doesn't hand out seats as brownie points for good behavior and if Western nations tried to conduct a ""coup"" of sorts by replacing Russia's representation without the material power basis behind that replacement, it would render the UN Charter dead letter. Non-Western nations would then have no reason to participate in what would be reduced to essentially another NGO aligned with Western interests. It'd defeat the purpose of the UN and consign it to the same fate as the League of Nations."
"Education in the US is a highly localized affair, and as a result making broad statements about what is happening in any area of classroom education is difficult. Still, we can look to the research on elementary education to help answer this question. The first issue is that elementary teachers spend on average 1 hour of instruction just dedicated to history (that is, not integrated with other subjects like English Language Arts). As a result, at best elementary students are treated to an incoherent vision of history; the lessons tend to be isolated to individual events taught without a broader context. 

Complicating this further is that most elementary teachers will have taken only one college-level history course, usually a survey of US history. They will not have learned about historiography or the historical method nor studied any one topic in great depth. Thus when they get to their own classrooms, they lack a vision for the purpose of teaching history and often report lacking the confidence to teach historical topics. As a result, what they teach comes out of what they remember learning from their own elementary educations (Darling-Hammond calls this the ""apprenticeship of observation""). And what they likely remember learning are the myths of national histories (Washington and the cherry tree, Columbus discovered America, etc.). 

Finally, these trends have been accelerated since 2001. With the passing of NCLB, a greater emphasis was put on success in standardized exams. In the NCLB framework, meeting proficiency in math and English language arts was what counted as ""success.""  And if it's not tested, it's not likely to be taught. I'll offer a personal example that exemplifies this trend: for four years I ran professional development around history education for elementary teachers in NY.  When NY decided to end the 5th grade Regents exam in history, principals immediately pulled their teachers from our program, a program they hitherto praised and were excited to send their teachers to.  We repurposed our program from ""Teaching NY and US History"" to ""Teaching Non-fiction Texts"" and our numbers went right back up. The Common Core is also a set of standards in math and English language arts, so these trends are likely to continue.

In summary: history in the elementary years is not prioritized by the educational bureaucracy, likely resulting in minimal history instruction (if at all). In addition, elementary teachers lack the requisite content knowledge and/or the confidence to spend a great deal of time on historical subjects. Thus when students get to the high school years they have likely learned a great deal of history at home, in movies, in video games, etc., much may not be reliably told.

"However Mexicas (aka Aztecs) did conquer most of modern day Veracruz. Several sources describe how fresh fish could be bought in Tenochtitlán after being brought all the way from the Gulf of Mexico, by Painanis or Mexica messengers, in a daily series of relays to cover the 400 km between the coast and the Aztec capital. Besides trade, by the post-classic era Mexicas had several military outposts all over Veracruz to maintain Aztec political dominance. The idea that Spaniards would be eventually greeted by Mexica leaders in Veracruz is not only plausible but the most likely scenario.

"We dont know that the Norse actually believed that *they'd* go to Vahalla, much less what they thought about other people.

I'm gonna let you in on an open secret about the early Middle Ages.  We dont know anything about the beliefs of the Norse.  We cannot name a single tenet/doctrine/guideline for their religious tradition with any real certainty.  This is because we count the number of contemporary descriptions of Norse religion that were written down by practitioners on no hands.  They simply dont exist.  Every single source we have on ""Norse mythology"" is either a later creation, written after conversion to Christianity, or was written by Christians, almost invariably with no actual first hand knowledge.  Trying to base an understanding of their beliefs about the afterlife, cosmology, and so on without primary sources is a little difficult as you might imagine!

All of the hallmarks of Norse mythology we know and love and see repeated in games, movies, books and so on are ultimately derived from sources that arent actually depicting Norse beliefs.  Odin as chief of the Gods, valkyries carrying the glorious dead to Valhalla, Loki as a trickster and agent of Ragnarok, and so on, all of this comes from a handful of sources most written in Iceland, centuries after conversion.  So why should one small group of sources from one corner of the Norse world stand in for the entire culture across its history across a geographic span from America to Russia and over several centuries?

Now to be clear there are evidently some elements to the stories that preserve some form of belief from preconversion times, but the sagas were not written to catalog the religion, but to entertain and provide ways for composers and poets to show their stuff.  They were never intended to accurately convey information about pre-Christian Norse society, but they have been used to do exactly that in the intervening centuries.  Despite the fact they fly in the face of archaeological evidence.  The deities that we know and love, Heimdall, Tyr, Loki, all of whom are relatively unattested in place name evidence are common in the sagas, and vice versa deities such as Ullr rarely appear in the saga literature despite far more evidence of a widespread cult based on place names.  

So tl;dr we dont know what we think we know about Norse mythology, and it's impossible to try and extrapolate from the material that we do have to other cultures.

Older scholarship such as Davidson's *Scandinavian Mythology* and ""Gods and Myths of Northern Europe* should be avoided because they rely on outdated assumptions about the reliability of saga/eddic evidence and doesn't incorporate newer archaeological understanding.

"Fun though it is to imagine a young Julius Caesar patronizing the Roman equivalent of a thrift store or modelling his hairstyle on the retro example of Tiberius Gracchus, there a few problems with the premise of this question. First, of course, the idea of thinking in terms of decades is really a twentieth-century thing (though prefigured earlier). Equally modern is the phenomenon of a mass culture dictating general trends in fashion. There were certainly trends in Roman clothing and hairstyles, as we'll see, and some of those trends were both widespread and cyclical. But they were largely confined to the elite, and were never as closely identified with a generation or era as, say, bell-bottoms and the afro. Finally, and famously, the idea of a distinctive youth culture is another twentieth-century invention. Although Roman adolescents tended to be associated with certain modern-seeming traits (including a want of good judgement in matters sartorial), they were never regarded as a distinctive social group.

So: young Romans did not use fashion choices to signal personal inclinations or group membership in the same way modern youths do. But they did understand fashion as an important marker of personal identity.

Clothing in ancient Rome, as in any premodern society, was relatively expensive (all that weaving and spinning took time, and the best dyes weren't cheap). So most Romans had, by modern standards, a small wardrobe. Because non-elite people didn't buy clothes very often, new styles spread relatively slowly, and to be limited to the minority who could afford to treat clothing as an accessory. But fashions did change, sometimes quite noticeably. In the imperial era, they tended to be dictated, or at least strongly influenced, by the reigning emperor and empress, whose widely-disseminated portraits were imitated by the ambitious throughout the Empire.

Since I only have time to survey a few of these changes, we may as well start with the famous toga. The toga was always massive, semicircular in cut, and woolen in material. But the way it was draped and folded changed over time; compare, for example, the massive sculpted folds of the imperial toga with the slimmed-down version preferred in late antiquity. Women's clothing, though less well-attested artistically, seems to have been susceptible to rapid changes of fashion and cut; scandalized Roman authors sometimes fulminate against unprecedentedly risque silken gowns and the like.

Hairstyles also changed over time. Although Roman men in the classical period almost always wore their hair short, women's styles changed quite rapidly, ranging from the modest bun of the Augustan era to the vast towers of curls affected by the Flavian grande dame. Beard styles changed almost as quickly. Most Roman men shaved clean from the mid-Republican period to the reign of Hadrian, when the emperor's beard made whiskers fashionable. For the rest of the second and third centuries, beards were de rigueur, with styles ranging from the longish ""philosopher's beard"" of Marcus Aurelius to the stubble of the third-century military emperors.

There were, in short, always stylistic choices available to those Romans who could afford to think about style. But to judge from our evidence - which is, admittedly, mostly artistic, and thus apt to show people in terms of conservative artistic conventions - most fashion-forward Romans keenly adhered to the reigning styles of the day. Some styles were cyclical - beards, for example, oscillated in length and cut - but they do not seem to have done so from any conscious or nostalgic attempt to recall a past time, save insofar as they were inspired by emperors who modeled their look on a famous predecessor.

There were, however, a few oddballs who wished to be identified as representatives of an older, Republican Rome, and dressed accordingly. The most famous of these was of course Cato the Younger, who identified with the past to the extent of wearing an old-fashioned loincloth under his toga (most men of his generation just wore linen under-tunics). Cato's affectations were also influenced by his Stoic creed, and by the Roman association of certain fashion choices (beards, simple clothing) with a philosophical lifestyle.

To return at last to the question, different eras in Roman history were certainly associated with different fashions in hairstyle and clothing. But there is little evidence for individuals consciously evoking past eras by adopting these conventions. The personal qualities that Roman fashion was intended to advertise - class, status, philosophical affiliation, etc. - were most effectively communicated through adherence to (or ostentatious rejection of) the reigning style."

"That very much depended on how close the local nobility were to the local normal people. Unfortunately, we don't know as much about day to day relationships between nobility and non-noble locals as we'd like, because usually it only comes up in sources during a revolt of some kind, but I think a few general comments can be made. 

There were those like William Marshall who basically never interacted with locals. They were always off doing something, and were hardly ever around to be recognised. That being said, his wife spent a large amount of time in the town of Ross on the east coast of Ireland. The Chronicle of Old Ross describes her keen interest in the town, to the extent that she personally oversaw town planning and built New Ross, the name given to the town's new port district. People would definitely have interacted with her regularly, but hardly ever seen her husband. 

Lower nobility, like those with only one or two manorial estates, would have had far more interaction with local people. There were occasions where they were necessarily brought together. It was commonly expected that they would oversee criminal proceedings, if not pass judgement themselves in the manor courts (this depended on region), concerning local people. There was also the necessity of keeping the manor in good shape and making sure a good harvest came in, which some lords did through a steward but there were no doubt some who saw to this personally. Through this they'd get to know the more useful people like blacksmiths and tailors. 

And they would be petitioned by locals to sort out local issues; very basic stuff like ""Jim's sheep keep eating my crops and I'd like compensation and for you to let me build a fence"". Again, many if not most aristocrats outsourced this to a steward, but it was always an optional and sometimes recommended activity - there are some things that only the manager can sort out. 

There were also less official reasons. Robert I, Duke of Normandy was (allegedly, according to Oderic Vitalis, see comment below) known to spend rather a lot of time with a local tanner. The tanner's daughter was *very* familiar with her local nobility, resulting in William the Conqueror. 

So I think it's pretty reasonable to think that were a nobleman to travel from their manorial estate or castle into town, they'd be recognised by a few people."

"WHO estimates 2-3%, but it infected 500 million people. Those who died were also skewed more towards young, healthy adults than typical flu. Many of the deaths were from immune system *overreactions*, so it hit those with healthy, strong immune systems harder than expected. 50% of US deaths from the Spanish flu were ages 20-40, compared to last year's flu season where just shy of 75% were 65+."

"Well like many industrial processes there are some fairly nasty chemicals involved, so to an extent we're relying on good regulation. There have been a few cases in China where various toxic spills have occurred from solar plants (e.g. see [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030802595.html?referrer=emailarticle)). 

There are also some issues with specific types of solar power, e.g. CdTe cells or CIGS cells, which contain cadmium. As you probably know, Cd is very toxic. There's currently a lot of work going on to eliminate Cd from all consumer equipment, so this should be solved in time.

In context though, it's important to remember that all of these impacts tend to be minimal compared to the environmental and health implications of coal power. So as long as we're replacing coal, it's still easily a benefit. And, of course, solar isn't much different to many other high tech industries, so it's not like the issues I mentioned above are uniquely problematic.

EDIT: a few people below are correctly pointing out that CIGS is copper-indium-gallium-selenium. However, normally there is cadmium in the buffer layer. There are basically 4 layers: molybdenum -> CIGS -> cadmium sulphide -> doped zinc oxide."

"While this addresses part of OP's question very well, it is missing something - why are red, yellow, and blue taught as the primary colors in schools? The answer, perhaps unsatisfactorily, is just that it's a historical tradition, and not even a very good one at that! [James Gurney's posts on color and the color wheel](http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/2010/02/color-wheel-part-1.html) summarize the history and touch on the fact that some modern painters use 6 or even 10 primary colors in their work. The assignment of primary colors as far as pigment mixing for painting goes is *almost* but not totally arbitrary."
"There is also another thing: low voltage cutout. When the battery reach a certain low voltage, a protection in the device kick in and stop it from draining power. This prevent an over discharge, which can cause the battery to leak.

Once the load is shut off, the battery voltage recover, but the protection is still active: it is the same cell, so still discharged.

Removing the cell and reinserting it cause the protection to reset, and you can now use a bit more power out of the same cell.

Of course, this also mean that you may be overdischarging the cell, and cause internal shell corrosion at an accelerated speed. This mean that the cell can leak faster than expected.

For example, duracell garanty that their cells is good for atleast 10 years with over like 80% energy left and still won't leak. However, a fully empty cell may leak after just a bit over a year.

So, the duracell cell in your remote control may last 15 years, but leak in a forgotten toy after maybe 1.5 year.

edit: eevblog on youtube made a video about the batterizer scam, one of them cover the recovery, discharge curve and all. I'm too lazy to link it up."

"There is an excellent book by Rick Hanson PhD (Berkeley): [Resilient](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36025434-resilient?from_search=true)

The book is about how you can use mindfulness practices (mental workouts, really) to train your brain to weaken negative thought habits and to get better at constructive thought patterns.  

The brain is like a muscle and it gets good at what we use it for.  If we constantly ruminate over negative experiences then our brain will get increasingly good at doing that.  This book is a training manual for breaking that negative cycle and achieving a healthy mind.

The book is highly practical, well organized, easy to read, and is solidly based on science and professional practices in the fields of psychology and neuroscience.  It also comes in audiobook format, which you might even find in your library.

Humans have the unique ability to use reason to defy our natural instincts when they are counterproductive and to modify our behavior patterns in more positive directions.  This book teaches practical ways to achieve that end.

"If the Earth were a perfect sphere and you walked a ""horizontal"" path (i.e. [your path is a line in this plane which is tangent to the spherical earth at the point where you started](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hPosy.png)), then the first step you take will be off the surface of the earth by less than a hundredth of a millimeter, but you'd still be off the surface. As others have said, after a mile of walking, the ground would be about 8 inches or roughly 20 cm below your feet. 

You could never take a single step of any distance along a tangent line to a sphere without stepping off the sphere. 

In reality, the Earth is not a very perfect sphere from our reference scale, so the particular topography where you're walking has many orders of magnitude more of an effect than the curvature of the earth when you're walking around.

Edit: Someone else below asked how far they would have to walk before they couldn't reach the ground so I found a general formula for your distance from the ground after you walk any distance along the tangent line. Comment pasted below if anyone is interested.

>I did a little algebra and found a general formula for the distance off the ground your feet will be depending on how far you walk. Keep in mind this is the distance straight down (i.e. in the direction of the center of the Earth). The farther you walk along the tangent line, the more it'll feel like you're walking uphill. This is always the distance straight down to the ground. 

>Let ""D"" be the distance in meters you walked along the tangent line, and let ""R"" be the radius of the earth in meters. R is roughly equal to 6,371,000 m.

>In that case, ""X"" which is your distance from the ground in meters is:

>X = R((((D/R)^2 + 1)^1/2 ) - 1)

>If the formatting is hard to read, you take the square root of (D/R)^2 + 1, then subtract 1, then multiply all that by R. 

>If you want to plug in your tip-toe height difference as X and solve for the distance you'd have to walk, then just rearrange the equation to get this:

>D = R((((X/R) + 1)^2 - 1)^1/2 )

>You can use any units for D, R and X that you want. Just make sure they're all the same unit."
"It means that it is impossible for our universe to be both local and real, one or both of those properties must be false. It means that either there are interactions at a distance in our universe or that the underlying foundations of our universe behave in a very exotic and strange way, taking actual form only when indeed interacting with anything.

**Local** means here that all interactions take place in the direct spatial and temporal neighborhoods. While the temporal part is intuitive for us, the spatial one is not - we are used to perceiving and even manipulating things at a distance. But this is all an illusion (we see only photons that reach our eyes and we use electromagnetic radiation to transfer sound to our wireless headphones) and from what we know so far, our universe is entirely local as we know not a single action at a distance. Even famous quantum entanglement is an inherently local phenomenon because for the entanglement itself to happen, both particles must be in a direct neighborhood.

**Real** means here that all quantum objects indeed have specific properties since the moment of their creation, just like we are used to perceiving the world. To simplify a lot, whether they are hard or soft in touch is defined at the very moment when they were created. If they were non-real instead, whether they are hard or soft would be determined only when you actually touch them, long after their creation. In other words, to answer if our universe is real is to answer if we perceive quantum world behavior in a probabilistic way because it is inherently probabilistic (non-real universe) or because we lack some kind of knowledge about the measured object (real universe).

It's important to note here that there is no such thing as ""passive observation/measurement"" in the quantum world. You can't just sit idly by and watch quantum objects behave. You have to actually ""touch"" them, to actually interact with them, altering their state.

That said, it's also important to state that we don't know which of those properties is actually false or even if both are false. We only know that they can't simultaneously be true."

"The general method for testing the unknown probability of a random event would be to run the event multiple times and count the results.

That is to say that if the coin is only slightly lopsided, with a 51% chance of being heads, then when you flip the coin 1000 times, you should get around 510 heads and 490 tails (give or take). The more you flip the coin, the closer you can get to its probability.

If the coin is fair in its unfairness (that is, it's always 51%), then you can verify the results by grouping the flips differently.

For example, if you flip 5040 times, you could group them into sets of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 flips.

The 1 Set should have 2570 heads.  
The 2 Set should have 655 that are 2 heads.  
The 3 Set should have 222 that are 3 heads.  
The 4 Set should have 85 that are 4 heads.  
The 5 Set should have 34 that are 5 heads.  
The 6 Set should have 15 that are 6 heads.   
The 7 Set should have 6 that are 7 heads.  

You don't need to worry if the numbers are a little off, only that they are close, and remember there can be outliers.

You can flip your coin the requisite times and use those expectations to figure out the apparent probability.

For X being the number of All Heads in the set and Y being the probability...  
1 Set; X = (5040/1)×Y¹.  
2 Set; X = (5040/2)×Y².  
3 Set; X = (5040/3)×Y³.  
etc.

From there, you can average the probabilities you received, and arrive at the apparent bias of the coin."

"It helps to understand the scale involved.  If vaccine development successfully finishes on October 1 and they can make a million doses a day (which may be optimistic, but they’re trying to get a jump on production before trials finish), then there will be 92 million doses manufactured by New Years.  If every single batch meets quality control standards (seems unlikely to be that perfect), every single one goes to a member of the public in need (which assumes that the distribution is efficient), every dose works and creates an immunity (doubtful), and none of those people get sick before the vaccine immunity is in place (risky), the 92 million people will be vaccinated.

Using US numbers as an example, that still leaves 240 million people unvaccinated, who will be at risk if we push to reopen faster.  Further, that assumes that all doses go to Americans, which is extraordinarily selfish and will absolutely burn critical international bridges.

At a million doses produced, QCed, delivered a day, it will take another 240 days (end of August 2021) to cover everyone else in the country.  To reach decent herd immunity levels, maybe we only need 90% of the population (maybe 300 million total), which gets us to late July 2021 instead (this year’s 92 mill and 208 mill next year).

To cover the world as a whole with that level of herd immunity will require 7 *billion* doses (~90% of 7.8 billion).  At a million a day, that’s 7000 days, or 19 years.  100% coverage adds another 2 1/2 years.

Now, in reality, things aren’t going to go that smoothly.  But in our favor, we can expect massive increases over early production numbers as new plants in multiple countries come online and the process grows more efficient.  But we also probably won’t start at a million a day, either.

My point is that it’s going to take considerable time for any novel vaccine to be produced and rolled out in sufficient numbers to cover a material percentage of the public, and you can bet that nearly every nation on the planet will be squabbling to get their fair share (or more).  That will make it difficult for any one nation to quickly reach sufficient herd immunity, let alone 100% coverage.  And that doesn’t account for setbacks like issues during trials or production, espionage (corporate or otherwise), sabotage (do you really think agents from our enemies won’t attempt to prolong this crisis), politics, antivaxxers and 5G conspiracy theorists, and so on.

Depending on how the vaccine is rolled out, some areas may be able to open quickly.  For example, if hard-hit cities get enough early on (to stem the tide), maybe that will help stall the pandemic and we can reopen those cities.  If everyone was to start wearing their masks and keeping distance, we could open before the vaccine’s ready.  If first responders and critical personnel get it first, then we can’t reopen, but we’ll stop hemorrhaging those lives at least, and it will help the rest of survive.  But let’s be honest...in the US, the wealthy and mega wealthy will get two doses each...

"All distances are measured relative to a reference frame, and since the three observers are in different reference frames, they would not agree on the distances. Except that this is even more confusing: *Time* too is dependent on the reference frame, so they would not agree on how much time has passed. And if you try to make them all measure ""simultaneously"", you will discover that measurements that are made simultaneously in one reference frame are not simultaneous in the other reference frames."
">intelligent  life is rare. Life has thrived on Earth for billions of years before one species developed spaceflight. Evolution doesn't inevitably lead towards developing life that can invent advanced technology. There may be many planets out there full of animals and plants, or even just bacteria, but it's possible that humanity is a bit of a freak accident.

my intuition leans hard in this direction. the CHONPS elements are some of the most abundant (non-helium) elements in the universe; we've found large numbers of simple organic molecules in space -- the chemistry is there. Self-replicating chemicals becoming common in places that don't physically forbid them seems.. like an almost inevitable conclusion?

but there have been SO MANY SPECIES on Earth and only one small genus ever developed metallurgy. To invent electronics and radio transmitters and the like, you need a (highly?) social species that is capable of complex communication to share technological information from generation to generation. Probably needs to be eusocial to have group size big enough to allow for sufficiently high rate of technological progress. I'm guessing the life would have to be on land, because I don't see how you could invent metallurgy under water, but that may be a lack of imagination on my part.   


There's no reason for something like humans to evolve. We're not necessary or inevitable. Earth made lots of weird and cool life before us and probably will continue to do so after us. Animals can be very smart (corvids! cephalopods! cetaceans! other great apes!) and extremely successful without ever picking up a soldering iron or blueprinting a factory."
"The big problem with biodiesel is not as obvious though: We simply can't prduce enough crops at this point to fully replace our oil consumption and it is likely that we never will.

Even using only a fraction of the available agrarian resources to replace oil will lead to food shrotages in developing countries, as the developed world can spend much more money on fuel than the developing countries can spend on food.

In other words: The moment it becomes more profitable to turn grain into biodiesel than to sell it as food, we will very liekly see a lot of famines.

This already happened on a small scale when the EU decided to make 10% biodisel mandatory in all fuels in the EU. The result where sharply rising prices on food prodcuts in much of the developing world. "
"A part of this that is less of a factor in English than in some other languages, is that you might not know which form of a word to use.

If someone says ""My feet are cold"", you can boil it down to ""me"", ""foot"", and ""cold"", and understand the meaning. But if you were to do it the other way around, you might not know for sure if it's ""me"", ""I"", or ""my"", for example. Same with ""foot"" or ""feet"", or maybe ""foots""? 

You might understand the word ""armchair"" because you know ""arm"" and ""chair"", even if you never heard it before, or forgot it. But coming up with the right word from a concept in your head might be impossible."
"> Probably got whacked by something is the general consensus.

Hold up - that *used* to be the consensus, but is generally not the preferred explanation any longer in planetary science.

Some 30 years ago, it was the standard answer that Uranus' odd axial tilt was the result of a giant impact. Bear in mind, though, that this was relatively soon after the Apollo missions had confirmed that our Moon had formed via giant impact (although there's evidence now that even this may not be so straightforward).

So, this may have been a case of ""when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail."" Giant impacts started being used to explain everything a bit odd in the solar system. Uranus is weirdly tilted? Must've been hit by something! Venus rotates backwards? Must've been hit by something! Huge cliffs on Miranda? Must've been hit by something! Weird two-tone coloration on Iapetus? Must've been hit by something! Neptune has a mysterious source of internal heat? Must've been hit by something!

This hypothesis started waning about 15 years ago when impact simulations were getting good enough to show that it's exceptionally difficult to produce an impact that's large enough to tilt Uranus but not completely obliterate the planet. It's a little more likely to do this with multiple impacts, but still not exactly easy.

[The most likely scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0181) at this point is that Uranus had some kind of gravitational near-miss, enough to induce a tidal torque that could turn its axial tilt. There's also some evidence that this scenario would require ejecting some mass in the process, possibly a big moon. The remaining moons would eventually fall in line with the new inclination angle of Uranus' equator due to tidal forces acting over billions of years. This explanation also has the neatness that it may explain why Uranus doesn't have a big moon, which we'd expect from most formation scenarios; moreover, there are at least some formation scenarios that suggest Uranus and Neptune swapped orbits early on, providing ample opportunity for this gravitational near-miss to occur.

""Human intelligence comprises comprehension of and reasoning about an infinitely variable external environment. A brain capable of large variability in neural configurations, or states, will more easily understand and predict variable external events. Entropy measures the variety of configurations possible within a system, and recently the concept of brain entropy has been defined as the number of neural states a given brain can access.""

"Plasticizer! Some plastics and rubbers have chemicals called plasticizers that enhance the material's flexibility. One of the characteristics of plasticizers is that they're volatile, meaning they naturally want to evaporate.

Plasticizer evaporation is also the reason that extremely old tennis balls become brittle."

"Spontaneous recovery from depressive episodes is common, but research on it is not so extensive (not many recovered depressed patients would be recruited for clinical trials, and as far as I know spontaneous recovery has not been modelled in animals).

However, people who have recovered from depressive episodes are at greater risk of further episodes, so there may be residual changes which contribute to this risk."

"Good question! I wouldn’t think so. I am a speech language pathologist with a background in sign language and I am working to educate myself about dyslexia. From what I understand, the reading difficulties arise from the brains ability to process written letters with corresponding sounds, which includes perceiving the letter, quickly recalling what sound(s) it can make, and stringing the sounds together to make a word. This is why it is difficult for someone with dyslexia to read and write.


In the case of sign languages, Most signs in the lexicon or “word bank” are whole words. There are occasionally words that don’t have a sign, so they are spelled out using the manual alphabet. Names are often spelled too. In this case, they might have trouble decoding the word being spelled out, but as with any other miscommunications, there are other ways to get the message across. "

"With a bicycle you can change the gearing so that your legs can keep pedalling at the same cadence. In running your legs have to move faster, and I suppose that is where the limit actually lies. Even in a vacuum your legs would probably not be able to move much quicker than they do at 1 atmosphere."
"Before anyone goes mocking this question, it's actually very clever. Let me explain.

The sun is fluid, all the way through, even if that fluid is very different than any you might be used to on earth. It's a plasma, meaning that the electrons are separated from the nuclei (though the level of ionization varies with temperature and depth). This traps light, specifically photons, which bounce back and forth between charged particles. 

The deeper you go, the denser this plasma gets, as it gets compressed by all the weight on top of it. The outer most layers of the sun that you see, 'the photosphere', is just the part where this plasma has such a low density that photons can escape from it. But it's actually a layer about 300 km thick, because the average distance a photon can travel here before bumping into a charged particle is a few 100 km. This means they escape, shining off into the solar system. This does a good job of giving the sun an apparent 'surface,' but it is by no means solid, and the sun extends well above the photosphere.

So if you were invincible, impervious to the incredible heat of the sun, what would happen if you tried to stand here? Well, you'd fall like a rock. The density of plasma in the photosphere is far less than the density of earth's atmosphere- you'd fall as if there's almost no drag. It would be like freefall- very, very hot freefall.

So would you ever stop falling? Yes! Why? Bouyancy, from your relative density. Denser things sink, like rocks in water, but less dense things float, like helium balloons in air. And remember, the sun gets denser as you go down. The core is a hundred times denser than you, so if I tried to put you there, you'd float up. Wherever you start, you'd eventually stop when you reach the part of the sun that is just as dense as you, about 1 g/cm^(3). [Coincidentally, that's *halfway down through the sun.*](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OJDu7.png)

"Yes, absolutely there are endangered trees! And they go extinct very similarly to animals, but not exactly the same since trees generally live a lot longer and are less... Hidden. Like, if you spot a tree in the wild, you know exactly where it is always going to be. But beyond that, its almost exactly the same.

Especially in the sense that some cultivation programs keep certain trees alive even as they're extinct or almost-extinct in the wild.  

[This tree](http://nzpcn.org.nz/flora_images_large/Pennantia-baylisiana-2.jpg) for example is the last wild tree of its kind. And its been the last one since at least the 1940s. It grows on an island off the coast of New Zealand. The rest of them went extinct when goats or sheep were introduced to the island and the little buggars ate them all. 

There are more of those trees being cultivated in nurseries, but they haven't been introduced because researchers are concerned about potential contamination. The trees grew in complete isolation naturally; they don't want to introduce disease and pathogens to the island by planting a bunch of trees from nurseries, especially at the expense of the last one.

"I totally agree with your first statement, but as a designer of instrumentation, I do need to point out that even with noise compensation, the increased intrinsic noise level forms a fundamental limit to the device’s sensitivity. Noise comp can only do so much and it also has repercussions with regard to measurement uncertainty. For really sensitive instrumentation, the older material will always be better. On the other hand, most instruments probably don’t need to be that sensitive, and noise comp would be fine, if it’s even needed at all."
"Two important properties of a high-quality hashing algorithm are the Avalanche Effect (whereby a small change to the input should have a massive change to the output) and Collision Resistance (whereby it should be computationally difficult to find two inputs that generate the same hash code).  Based on hashing alone, use of a proper and secure hashing algorithm should ideally make detecting whether or not two passwords are similar impossible.

Sadly, the truth of the matter is that in all too many cases, the best practice of storing and comparing password hashes is often not implemented.  [Some big companies still store passwords as plaintext](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xdeby/t-mobile-stores-part-of-customers-passwords-in-plaintext-says-it-has-amazingly-good-security), while others [still use password encryption](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_71/rzahy/rzahypwdencrypt.htm)^0.  Chances are very high that if you're encountering a site that can determine whether or not a new password is similar to an old password, they're either storing your password as plaintext (or partial plaintext), or are encrypting/decrypting your password.

That said, there are methods even with hashing that could be used to detect when two passwords are too close together.  While researching this response, I came across an interesting paper^1 that details a method of monitoring keystroke dynamics when entering a password.  By measuring _how_ a person types their password, you could generate a bunch of subsets of the keystrokes in the password and compare that to a stored set of dynamics to determine if some subset of those dynamics appears to be for the same set of keystrokes.

You could also conceivably store a password as a series of hashes for various password character subsets.  Unsalted, this would be almost as wildly insecure as storing a password in plaintext (as there are only roughly 24 million hashes for all sets of four characters^2, making it easy to pre-generate them all and rebuild the password by just looking them up in a database).  Adding a decent length salt would help, and would provide a way to test for n-lists of identical characters in a row using only hashing.^3

However, as noted above, any site that provides such a ""feature"" probably isn't storing your password using a cryptographic hash (or at least not _solely_ as a cryptographic hash).  The Avalanche Effect should make determining password ""closeness"" from a secure hash alone impossible, without resorting to tricks like keystroke dynamics.

-----
^0 -- it's important to note that whereas _hashing_ is a one-way function (put password in, get a hash out) that can't be reversed, _encryption_ is defined as a pair of functions, one of which can _encrypt_ a password, and another which can take the encrypted form and _decrypt_ it back to the password again.

^3 -- note that I haven't done a full security analysis of using such a mechanism, so even salted, please don't use this system in something that requires good security.  However, this might make an interesting avenue of research for an advanced Honours student or a new Masters student to look into, even if only to determine that it's a terrible idea that should never be implemented in practice!

"In Wyoming we have granite mountains with no springs or streams, a thousand feet above the dry prairie floor. They are almost solid rock with very little dirt, large rounded massive structures. When it rains, small depressions in the rock fill up with water and I often find what looks like tiny shrimp swimming around in the water. They can't be full of water for more than a few weeks at a time. Independence Rock, a tourist spot, is an example where you can find small shrimp in puddles on top, the higher mountains around it have them too.

Sometimes I'll also see a small basin in the prairie floor fill up with water and there will be tiny fish fry swimming around in them, after only having rained a few weeks ago at the most. They look like little guppy babies or something, very tiny.

It doesn't seem like the top answer would explain either of these. Anyone familiar with Wyoming or similar environments know how these happen?"
"Strictly speaking, we CAN use most nuclear waste. Breeder reactors can be used to consume pretty much all usable fissle materials and produce a much lower volume of equivalent waste with different properties.

"So, immunotherapy has long been seen as a holy grail for cancer treatment. The immune system is naturally programmed to attack cells that have gone a bit weird (to use the scientific term). The problem tends to be that the cancer cells can also alter themselves so that they are disguised from the immune system, or in fact inhibit any immune cells that come into contact with them. This stops the immune system from seeing them as dangerous, allowing the cancer to grow. So the balance of the immune response is in favour of leaving the cancer alone.

What this treatment does is inject the tumour with molecules that tell the immune cells in the vicinity of the tumour to wake up and start doing their job, overcoming the inhibition that the cancer cells have put in place. This means that the balance of the immune response is now to attack the tumour, which seems to work very well.

The really cool thing is that now that the immune system is trained to see the tumour as bad, and will attack similar cells in different sites. This is why it behaves in some fashion like a vaccine.

It's perfectly viable, and very exciting. As always, there is always the question of how well it translates into human biology but it is still very promising. I think one problem is going to be how specific the immune response is. In the paper, they see the immune cells are trained to attack cells with protein markers unique to the tumour cells, which is a good sign. One concern might be that if you accidentally trigger the immune response to normal cell markers, it could cause your immune system to attack healthy cells which would obviously be a very bad consequence. Another would be how readily a tumour can evolve to overcome the immune system attack. If the immune system only ends up going for certain markers, it could miss tumour cells that don't have the same ones. These could then continue to grow and cause the cancer to return.

"Has anyone looked at direct cultural ties to left or right handedness? I had temporarily lost the use of my right hand over a medical condition, and came to the realization of how much easier people that are right handed have it when I was learning to write with my left hand. In English, right handers drag away from the fresh ink, left handers have to lift and place, or float over fresh ink to not smudge.

In contrast, I have a Jewish friend that is left handed and grew up learning to write Hebrew first. Writing in opposite of English, from right to left, being left handed has the same advantage of dragging away from the ink and naturally not causing smudges.

"In addition to the immune response answer given earlier, the fact that it's a burn doesn't have to do with your skin radiating heat. That happens with other types of injuries as well. With sunburn, a widespread area of your skin has been damaged so the immune/repair responses are caring for a large amount of skin surface area and thus a large amount of heat generated. If you accidently slam your fingers in a door or cut yourself or get scratched by a cat for example that area will feel hot to the touch as well.

Then if you do even say, establish what consciousness *is*, there are very few neural correlates of consciousness we can measure that explain how consciousness and the brain interact (perhaps one of the most famous and interesting ones being [Libet's experiments](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/106/3/623/271932?redirectedFrom=fulltext) that show that brain activity precedes conscious awareness)

Even if there were a consensus, research into psychedelic substances is shedding new light on the subject and could very well reshape theories of consciousness/brain interactions as well as our perspective of the nature of consciousness altogether in the coming years, for sure in the next decade if research isn't aborted like it was in the '60s."

"Since the question has been answered already, this is just a reminder: COVID mutates slower than the flu.  We are seeing these mutations because of the high numbers of cases in various regions.  The more people it reaches the more chances it has to mutate.  Getting vaccines out to vulnerable areas and encouraging mask-wearing should help slow the spread and thereby reduce mutations."
"Because the first time you compress it, it makes it as small as it can. 

Imagine you could zip it a second time and it would get smaller.  Why wouldn't you just have your compression software zip it twice automatically with one ""zip"" action.  And in some cases this is sort of what happens.  In some software you can change the level of compression, to change how thorough it is, at the expense of speed of compression and decompression. 

But you can think of it mathematically too.  You are essentially factoring the contents.  RedditRedditRedditRedditReddit can be represented at 5(Reddit).  But now Reddit and 5 are essentially irreducible, ""prime"" almost. You could do 5(Re2dit) but this doesn't save any space. 

On the other hand, RedddditRedddditRedddditRedddditReddddit might be 5(Reddddit), but Reddddit might be Re4dit, so one level of compression might give you 5(Reddddit), but being more thorough might give you 5(Re4dit)

"Graphite in your pencil is pure carbon as well, its just all linked together.

Activated carbon is just a really fine pure carbon powder.

+ the heat from the sun will reach 248°F around 4 million miles out
+ marshmallows largely consist of air, which would cause it to explode in the vacuum of space. 

If you can find a way around that last bit, you could theoretically roast a marshmallow on the heat of the sun safely, but just barely. You would need to be about 3 million miles away from it, which is about 90 million miles away from the earth and about 34 million miles past mercury. "

"It has to have the same density as water. Sand will in fact move in the bottle when shaken. Like air, it has different density from water, which makes it blend when shaken. This is the point of the experiment - to show that mixing doesn't happen *when the contents of the bottle all have the same density*.

Think of the shake forces as momentary artificial gravitational forces going all different directions. Lighter objects go against the force (float) and heavier objects go with the force (sink). Shaking the bottle makes the force go all different directions, scrambling the contents. This doesn't happen when all the contents have the same density, because there's no floater and no sinker."
"I wonder if more robust testing gives a more robust estimate of prevalence and thus more accurate case fatality rate estimates. In locations where it is difficult if not impossible to know the actual rate of disease in a population, ie places where testing was slow to roll out, withheld because of limited test availability or restricted by mandate, the disease has expanded well beyond what can reasonably be accounted for by limited testing, more disease = more sicker people and more deaths. In this case limited testing will far over estimate actual case fatality rates. Germany was proactive in early testing, identifying more cases early giving a better estimate of the actual denominator in the case fatality rate."

"Nothing really.

We already knew different genes can express differently depending on the type of stress the individual is in.

Frequent or long term starvation/malnutrition for example can result in pronounced changes to how the body handles growth and development. It's one of the reasons why when a society transitions to one in which food is consistently readily available, average height of the population increases each generation for a while.

So the ""change in DNA"" touted is a predictable result of the unique long term stress of weightlessness. A cool headline, but something we expected before we ever sent him up.

"This is a historical question, as Nowhere_Man_Forever points out. Generally, map makers oriented their maps towards what they thought was important. For example, some early maps were oriented east-west to aid navigation against the rising and setting sun. Later, North American explorers would make east-west oriented maps because those are the primary directions they traveled. 

But, people since antiquity have thought that the Earth rotated and knew that pole stars (i.e. the North Star for us today) would maintain an apparent fixed position in the night sky. This imparted special navigational importance to the north-south axis.

Then, when the magnetic compass was invented that solidified the north-south axis as the primary axis for navigation. Since it makes a lot of technical sense to have all your maps use the same orientation, the north-south axis was the only orientation that made sense. 

There's not a clear technical reason to use north=top instead of south=top. One theory is that at the time of the explorers there was no comparable pole star in the southern hemisphere like there is Polaris (which is exceptionally bright) in the northern hemisphere. However, that's a pretty weak theory.

It's probably just the case that the Europeans wanted to put Europe at the top of their maps, and their maps would end up having the largest sway over the future events to come. The other great powers in the world at the time didn't do as much exploration and weren't as imperial as the Europeans were, so their maps are the ones that stuck."

"Radioactivity, by itself, is not that useful for generating power. What is useful for generating power is the induced splitting of _lots_ of atoms at the same time, not the slow trickle of energy release you get from radioactive decay alone. To put it another way: nuclear reactors don't work because their fuel is radioactive, they work because their fuel is splittable by neutrons. Those are not the same thing (all fuel splittable by neutrons is radioactive, but not all radioactive atoms are splittable by neutrons). "
"The calculation that gives N = 6765 is under the following two assumptions:

1. You know that one coin is fair and the other has p = 0.51, you just don't know which is which.
2. You want to distinguish the coins to within 5% error. That is, roughly speaking, there is less than a 5% chance we actually have the fair coin *and* more than a 95% chance we actually have the biased coin. You can also set the tolerance to be different for each required condition.

Again, note that this is for distinguishing between a fair coin and a biased coin with *known bias*. You are not trying to estimate the bias of the biased coin. You know the other coin has a 51% chance of heads. You just need to figure out how many flips you need to say whether you have been flipping the fair or the biased coin this whole time.

This does not mean that if you just so happened to flip a coin 6765 times and got 4000 heads you could say with some confidence that you have a certain value of *p*. "

For other human coronaviruses, we know that it's very common to get sick once, but then pick up the virus again a few months later and shed it and infect other people, even without getting sick a second time.

So, if someone says they are safe because they had covid already... No.  No, they are not safe.  We do not know that.  They may very well be capable of getting the virus again, becoming infectious again, and being a danger to other people again."
"It greatly depends where on Earth you are.

In the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific gyres bottom water is pretty unaffected by seasonal changes in surface waters. 

Marine snow from the surface and mid-water ecosystems will be so strongly attenuated that strong seasonal peaks in productivity won't really be experienced at 3-5km depth.

This is due to all the grazing by metazoan zooplankton and heterotrophic protists  and recycling of organic and inorganic compounds by bacteria though the water column. Things are very different in the seas on continental shelves.

The deep ocean has an extremely stable temperature, such that measuring differences in bottom water temperature requires sensors accurate to hunderedths of a degree.

The basic findings are that sufficiently small raindrops will bounce off, larger ones that hit off center can rotate the insect in air, and larger ones making ""direct hits"" can cause the insect to drop, but even then quick recovery is possible.  The mosquitoes studied appear to survive the impacts well due to their ""strong exoskeleton and low mass...

"The story about how this was discovered is well documented. The government tried to build a lab and could not get the base numbers for background radiation.

"So your body puts about the same heat out as a 50w lightbulb.

You're constantly making heat, constantly metabolizing. 

If it's around room temperature, you are able to radiate the heat away without using any sweat. The variance in temperature is able to keep you feeling fine as is.

But the closer you get to the temperature our bodies run at, the less heat you are able to passively let off. So you sweat to use the power of evaporating water. Assuming it's not humid out this works well for a while, in fact, it works even past our own body temperature so long as you stay hydrated. But if it's kinda muggy out, then you can't lose the heat faster than it builds.

And so. You overheat. Just like a car going through a desert. The coolant and engine is hotter than the outside, but as outside nears closer to the car's temp, it can't drop all that heat away fast enough.

"The Sun's gravity actually *does* cause tides! They're just weaker than the Moon's tides.

The Sun's gravitational force on the Earth is stronger than the Moon's, but its tides are weaker. This is because tides decrease with distance more quickly than net gravity does.

Tidal forces are caused by the difference in gravity between one side of the planet and the other. Gravity drops off with distance, so one side of the planet gets pulled a bit more than the other. This causes the planet to get stretched a little bit, which is the tidal force.

If you're close to an object, gravity is dropping rapidly, which means that the tidal forces are extra strong. They're strong because the net gravity is strong, but they're extra strong because the gravity is dropping fast with distance. This is what makes tides decrease more rapidly with distance than net gravity, because there are, in a sense, two effects to make it stronger when you're close.

So the Moon ends up dominating our tides, even though we orbit the Sun."

"We have several nuclear powered spacecraft. The most common kind us RTG (radio-isotope thermoelectric generators). A piece of enriched material (usually plutonium) is left to naturally decay. That material is naturally hot. That heat is then harvested usually with thermoelectric generators (relying on the Seebeck effect, like thermocouples and Peltier coolers) and dumped into external radiators.

This has been used for decades, principally on missions to the outer reaches of the solar systems like Voyager, Pioneer 11 and 12, Cassini, New Horizon and even the latest batch of Mars rovers Curiosity and Perseverance (set to take off in less than a month). They were even used during the Apollo missions to power some of the experiments they left on the Moon. [Here you can see Alan Bean on Apollo 12 unloading it from the LEM.](https://cdn10.picryl.com/photo/1969/11/19/as12-46-6789-apollo-12-apollo-12-mission-image-alan-bean-unloads-alsep-rtg-6d7118-1600.jpg). The advantage of those is that they are relatively simple. They have no moving parts and nothing really that can break down. However they don't generate that much power compared to how much they weight, especially compared to solar panels. So if you can get away without using those it's often better.

The second type of nuclear power in space is to have a real reactor, like the ones you find in nuclear power plants of submarines. Those needs to go critical and require control systems, and much more complex engineering. However they can (in theory) generate much more power for a given quantity of material. The US experimented with those first in 1965 with the SNAP-10A spacecraft but never flew any other reactors after that.
The Soviet were a lot more prolific with nuclear reactors in space. They launched 35 RORSAT spacecraft. Those were low flying radar satellites which tracked US naval movements. The nuclear reactors were used for powering the high power radar system. One of the most notable story associated with that was the [Kosmos-954 incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954) where one of those reactors reentered above Canada and sprayed radioactive debris everywhere.

The USSR also developed an even more powerful TOPAZ reactors in the 80's which were coupled with electric plasma thrusters for propulsion needs.

The issue with real reactors (as opposed to RTG) is that they require a lot of complex auxiliary systems (control, cooling, energy generation). So small ones are hard to make and they really only become interesting in larger systems which are expensive and not needed often.

Since then there has been several other proposal and research projects for nuclear reactors in space. ~~JUICE~~ [JIMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Orbiter) was a proposal for a massive mission to Jupiter where a reactor would be providing power to ion thrusters. This got canceled after going pretty far into development.

Lately NASA has developed the Kilopower reactor which is a small reactor aimed at providing power for things like lunar and martian bases primarily but can be adapted for use on board spacecraft (IIRC).

Of course this is only for nuclear reactors used to produce electricity. There is also a whole other branch of technology where the heat for the reactor is directly used for propulsion. I can expend a bit on it but this is a bottomless pit of concepts, more or less crazy ideas, tested systems and plain science fiction concepts. A really good ressource for that kind of topic is https://beyondnerva.com/ which goes over historical designs and tradeoff in great depth."
"This is a complicated question, and the short answer is that cost, safety and efficiency are almost always more important factors than effective use of space.

It almost always comes down to per-unit manufacturing costs, which includes the tooling and machines to make the product or battery or costs like reject rates.

The notable exception to this is cell phones or other personal mobile electronics where space is a factor over almost everything else.

One of the main reasons they make higher capacity and amperage batteries round is entirely due to the manufacturing process.

So, a battery like a lithium-ion 18650 or similar is really a jelly roll of thin films, gel and metal foils stuffed into a thin metal can - or even just a foil pouch. It is an extremely high precision manufacturing process, so there needs to be an exact amount of tension on the webs of different materials that come together to be wound into the spool that becomes the core of the battery.

Too much tension and you can tear metal foils, squeeze out the electrolyte gel so there's not a large or safe enough gap between electrodes. Too little tension and it doesn't make full contact with itself and won't fit in the metal battery can it's designed to fit inside. (Sometimes lower capacity or cheaply made batteries have empty space in the can!)

And in either case if you don't get it right you have a potentially dangerous cell that could fail prematurely or even go into thermal runaway and catch fire or explode.

Next let's look at prismatic lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries. For most cell phone type batteries they're made with a similar wrapping and coiling process using films, gels and metal foils. Those batteries aren't actually square, they're more like squashed circles or ovals when you look at a cross section.

The machines used to make them need to carefully adjust and maintain wrapping tension as the flat or oblong battery core is wound as the tension needs are different at the ends as opposed to the flat parts.

Since the bend is tighter at the ends this introduces a stress point and point of failure, and the whole wrapping process is much more technically difficult and usually more expensive on a per battery cost.

So these kinds of oblong mobile electronic batteries tend to have thicker films as a safety feature, and this reduces their capacity.

So they're usually trading some capacity for that oblong shape and increased safety, which is why round cells can actually have higher energy density per cubic foot or weight than prismatic cells.

But wait, there's more! Let's look at AA, C, D and similar type cells. This battery format goes back nearly a hundred years at this point, and started with plain old zinc-carbon dry cell batteries. They don't use a roll of films like modern batteries, they use powders or pastes in a metal or even cardboard case.

But why are they round? Mainly because it's easier and cheaper to punch, draw and make metal shapes that are round than square or prismatic shapes. These cells also are a convenient shape for many consumer devices ranging from flashlights to portable radios.

Modern AAA, AA, C, D cells use either cylindrical, hollow pellets of battery chemicals or liquid gels, and using round cans means that they don't have to orient parts to match a square. All the parts in the stack are round and can go right in the can without having to have a complicated machine that lines up, say, square pellets or square seals in square cans.

But wait, what about other older square/prismatic batteries like the 9V, the 6V and 12V lantern batteries? What about car batteries and lead acid batteries?

In these cases these batteries were based on older battery chemistries that were actual ""piles"" and this is where originally get the name ""battery"" because it's a battery of plates or piles. Battery meaning a group or array of identical smaller things.

In these cases they were using many square plates stacked together. In original 9V batteries it was a stack of layers in that can, and similar constructions existed in 6v and 12v lantern batteries.

Side note: today many 9v batteries are actually 6 AAAA sized cells inside a can because it's just easier to make 6 round batteries and stuff them in a box.

In lead acid batteries found in cars, forklifts or older generation battery banks or backup systems, they use cast lead grid plates and battery chemistry pastes soaking in an acidic liquid or gel electrolyte.

They also made these batteries square because it was easiest to do for this chemistry and manufacturing process.

So why not use these kinds of batteries in an electric car or solar home power rig?

Well, they used to, and they still do. You still find them in heavy duty applications where they need a lot of reliable high amperage power where weight is less of an issue, like a forklift or the starter battery of a car.

But they don't use them in a Tesla because the weight to power ratio is just that much higher in a bank of 18650s or similar round batteries.

There's also now a lot more economic costs in manufacturing lead chemistry batteries. There's a fuckton of regulation and mandates about battery life and recycling them and so on."
"If you look at the pH concentration from 1985-2016 you will see a definite increase in the pH (good!) which shows a reduction in acid rain across the US.

"As I just made this account I do not have flair but I am a medical anthropology doctoral student having researched and published on the Zika virus.

Zika is most definitely still around but like most mosquito borne disease it is incredibly difficult to gain an accurate picture via epidemiology. As others have stated one of the main reasons we have not heard much about it lately in the US is due to there being limited cases, very often as a result of secondary travel at this point.

In Latin America where I conduct my fieldwork Zika raises multiple concerns including it is usually asymptomatic or mild, and it shares many parallels with other vector borne diseases such as dengue (which is generally perceived as a greater health concern). this necessitates clinical testing which is often not free, limiting further understandings of Zika's spread. 

Despite this governments have still been declaring areas to be endemic sites of Zika transmission most often due to the prevalence of the primary mosquito vector Aedes aegypti."

"Albedo is the proportion of of light that is reflected off a surface. It’s low for things like pavement, and high for things like snow. Albedo has the ability to affect climatic systems (do a quick search on albedo feedbacks in the arctic). An example off the top of my head is how permafrost thaws more quickly with an absence of snow. The vegetation beneath the snow is able to absorb solar radiation that would normally be reflected by snow (high albedo). I would argue that there are possible consequences to covering our surface with solar panels (low albedo I suspect), yet it is most likely negligible at our current land use. Good question, sorry my answer isn’t more insightful"

"Microwave ovens have an operating power of about 1000 W, depending on the model. Routers and access points, on the other hand, are limited by law in how much power they can use to broadcast. In many jurisdictions this limit is 0.1 W. Many devices will be below this legal limit.

So a microwave is 10,000 times more powerful than a router. Given enough wifi routers, you could also heat up food. If you could somehow manage to stack them all in a small space (and even then the processing electronics of the device would generate more heat than the microwave radiation)."

"The correlation between altitude and suicide risk is surprisingly strong and has been known for at least a decade:

>	Recent preliminary studies have reported a positive correlation between mean altitude and the suicide rate of the 48 contiguous U.S.states. … Although there was a negative correlation between county altitude and all-cause mortality (r = −0.31, p < 0.001), there was a strong positive correlation between altitude and suicide rate (r = 0.50, p < 0.001). Mean altitude differed in the 50 counties, with the highest suicide rates compared to those with the lowest rates (4684 vs. 582 ft, p < 0.001). Controlling for percent of age >50 yr, percent male, percent white, median household income, and population density of each county, the higher-altitude counties had significantly higher suicide rates than the lower-altitude counties. … We conclude that altitude may be a novel risk factor for suicide in the contiguous United States.

* [High Altitude Remains Associated with Elevated Suicide Rates after Adjusting for Socioeconomic Status: A Study from South Korea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4225216/)

* [Is Depression the Link Between Suicide and High Altitude?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6463990/)

The tentative suggestion is that the lower oxygen (hypoxia) associated with altitude leads, somehow, to depression and thus to suicide. 

>	One reasonable explanation could be the effects of hypoxia, or a deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues. This can influence the body’s metabolism of serotonin, one of the neurotransmitters related to aggressive behavior and suicide.

"**On crunches and 'the burn':** 

Accumulation of metabolic waste product.  When doing an exercise with a muscular metabolic demand similar to crunches (high rep pushups and squat jumps would be similar), the limiting factor is metabolic waste product buildup.  The 'burn' you feel is the accumulation of metabolic waste (particularly lactic acid) from the chemical reactions making your muscles 'go'. At this exercise intensity, you are operating at a rate of power where your muscles are accumulating metabolic waste products faster than that waste can be pumped out and excreted or processed.  Think of the burn you feel as a warning alarm, and the point where you can't do any more reps like your body hitting the emergency shut-off switch so you don't damage your muscles with excess waste buildup.  

*(Interesting anecdote: prey animals such as horses and rabbits have been known to 'run themselves to death,' as they seem to not have the same biophysiological safegaurds as humans in terms of the 'emergency stop' response to metabolic waste buildup.  Only time I've heard of a human doing that was the first ancient Marathon.)

**On pullups and acute fatigue at high-maximal power output:**

Because each rep requires substantially more force and power than each rep of, for example, crunches, the limiting factor here is creatine-phosphate (CP) availability.  You may have heard of 'creatine' in nutritional supplements; basically what creatine does is hold onto a phosphate, so when you break down adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) for energy, that creatine is waiting hooked up to a spare phosphate molecule to donate to spent adenosine-diphosphate (ADP), thus quickly and rapidly replenishing ATP for energy.

However, creatine is limited within the muscle, so once you've used up all of the creatine-phosphate 'donations', you're just out and can't produce power at the same capacity anymore until you allow some recovery time for the now free creatine molecules to pick up free phosphate molecules so they're ready to be again donated to ADP.  It takes roughly 10-20 seconds operating at maximum power to exhaust the vast majority (I don't remember the percentage off the top of my head) of your creatine-phosphate within a given muscle.  Once this happens, you suddenly feel your muscles being unable to produce the required force for a movement, which is where the ""my arms just stop moving"" sort of feeling comes from.

However! if you were to immediately jump off the pullup bar after a set and swap to a lower-resistance exercise using the same muscle groups (e.g. pulldowns, rows, etc.) you could continue operating with less force and power until you begin accumulating metabolic waste products in those muscle groups and get the 'burn'.

**EDIT**: Here's a further breakdown of metabolic physiology!  

**Immediate phophagen**: The previously mentioned creatine-phosphate donation system. Provides majority of power for the first 10-20 seconds of activity at high-maximal power output. Requires 3-5 min for recovery. *This reaction does not require oxygen.

*Adaptaion mechanisms*: Increase in muscle cross-sectional area; shift of muscle fiber type towards faster-twitch glycolytic type (these fibers are actually whiter in color due to less blood demand)

*Examples of activity with high phosphagen demand*: 40-100 yard dash, set of 5-15 reps of resistance training

**Glycolytic system**: This system functions on the reaction of glycolysis within the cell cytoplasm. This chemical reaction replenishes ATP relatively quickly, but still more slowly than the phosphagen system. Glycolytic reactions create a byproduct of lactic acid (among other byproducts; citation needed), which can be cycled out and processed by the liver (if I recall correctly) or processed and used within the cell for aerobic respiration if the activity is at a low enough intensity. At high intensities, waste products from glycolysis accumulate and cause a burning sensation and eventual lack of muscular function until said waste products can be cycled out. *This reaction does not require oxygen.

*Adaptation mechanisms*: Increased cytoplasmic glycolysis enzymes, shift of muscle fiber type towards faster-twitch glycolytic type (these fibers are actually whiter in color due to less blood demand)

*Examples of activities primarily utilizing glycolysis*: 400 meter run; maximal set of pushups or other calisthenic exercise for trained individuals

**Aerobic respiration**: Lastly, aerobic respiration. This is the process which is likely dominant right now as you're comfortably sitting at a computer screen operating at a low power output. If operating at a low enough power output, lactate from the aformentioned glycolysis reactions can be cycled to the mitochondria to be processed through the elector transport chain for ATP resynthesis. I'm not gonna get into the nitty gritty of all of these reactions, but aerobic respiration is more energy efficient than glycolysis, but a much slower process. Thus, aerobic respiration is the default mechanism used to supply energy at rest or at lower intensity/high duration activity (e.g. distance running)

*Adaptaion protocol*: Increased capillary density, increased mitochondrial density, shift of muscle fiber proportion towards slower-twitch aerobic type (these fibers are more red in color due to increased capillary density.)

*Examples of activity primarily utilizing aerobic respiration*: running >1 mile, hiking, average pace over the course of a workout, resting state

**Disclaimer**: I work in the field; not academia.  As such I do not remember every single reaction, its components, and its products and byproducts.  This breakdown is intended for an audience of educated laymen outside the field of exercise physiology.  Experts on exercise physiology, please feel free to elaborate on any of my points!"

"It's actually not a biology reason but an engineering one. Humans can breath pretty much ok as long as the oxygen pressure is around what we are used to. For example at 1 atmosphere of pressure we have about 20% oxygen in air. The trick you can do it lower the pressure and increase the oxygen content and people will still be fine. With pure oxygen you can comfortably live with only 30% of sea level pressure. This is useful in spacecraft because lower pressures mean lighter weight systems. 

For Apollo (and Gemini and Mercury before them) the idea was to start on the ground with 100% oxygen at slightly higher pressure than 1 atmosphere to make sure seals were properly sealing. Then as the capsule rose into lower pressure air the internal pressure would be decreased until it reached 0.3 atmosphere once in space. However pure oxygen at high pressure will make a lot of things very flammable which was underestimated by NASA. During a ground test a fire broke out and the 3 astronauts of Apollo 1 died burned alive in the capsule.

At lower pressures this fire risk is less of an issue but now pure oxygen atmospheres have been abandoned in most area of spaceflight. The only use case is into spacesuits made for outside activities. Those are very hard to move into because they basically act like giant pressurized balloons. To help with that they are using low pressure pure oxygen.

"There are multiple ways to interpret probabilities. The way you're probably most familiar with is to consider them *relative frequencies*.

That means that if you have a fair coin (p = 1/2), you can say that in the limit as the number of flips goes to infinity, the fraction of results which give heads approaches 1/2.

But there is a sense in which probabilities represent your degree of *knowledge* or *belief* about the outcome of some experiment.

If I flip a coin and catch it in my hand so that nobody can see the result, there is a definite answer to the question ""Is the coin showing heads or tails?"". In other words, it's either definitely showing heads or definitely showing tails.

But nobody knows which yet. The best anybody can possibly say (assuming a fair coin and nobody is cheating) is that there's a 50% chance that heads is showing and a 50% chance that tails is showing.

This represents a *lack of knowledge* on our part. So the answer *is* predetermined, but nobody knows it yet. So we still ascribe a probability of 1/2 for either case, because that's the best we can do given our current knowledge."

"I actually work for AMD and work on the test team, so I might be able to provide some insight!! As a lot of people said before, there are different bins, or SKUs you see, like the i7, i5, i3, they are in fact the same exact silicon, just with things disabled because they may not have worked. For example, if one of the cores doesn’t work, they can just disable another one, and instead of having an 8-core processor, they can sell it as a 6-core. Aside from disabling cores, another common place you see faulty transistors, are within fast internal memory called cache. Processors usually have a few Mb of cache, it’s common for some of the cache cells to be dead upon manufacturing, so manufacturers build some backup cache cells. And when running tests, we can find those dead cells, and reroute those dead cells to the new ones. So when a processor tries to write to a cache address that is dead, there is some microcode internally that reroutes it to the newly assigned back up cache cell. It is possible too that there is enough cache cells that are dead that they end up having to drop the bin from an i7 to an i5 for example.

Also, there are a lot of transistors, and full circuits that are used simply for testing, and will never ever be used once the processor is on the shelf ready for someone to buy. These are called Design For Test features, or DFT.  An example of one of these are some structures called ring oscillators, which are basically really fast operating clocks, and their frequency can be affected by a lot of things, like heat and the health of the silicon. These are scattered all around the silicon at different points, and the frequency can be measured as another metric to heat at various parts of the silicon, as well as the health of the silicon at various parts, and they can also be averaged as another metric to gauge the overall health and possible operating frequency of the entire processor. However, they will never have any use once the processor is ready to be sold, and it’ll actually be impossible to access them.

So really to answer your question, a lot a lot a lot of testing goes in to making sure your processor is ready to go for all of your gaming or workstation needs. It would be rare for a transistor to die, it probably wouldn’t affect you much though unless it was a very very critical part, and it could take a long time for that dead transistor to mess up your computer.

"Apologies in advance, I’m not going to be able source most of this, but I work in process development at a major biologics / pharma company and have previously developed manufacturing lines and strategies for GMP nucleic acid processes (triphosphates and oligonucleotides).

The regulatory hurtles are not a major contributor to the timeline — The FDA has the power to grant emergency use authorization as they see fit, so if there was a vaccine we knew worked, it could be pushed through in <1 day. The challenge is building confidence that one works.

Beyond the confidence piece, it is entirely dependent on which vaccine candidate we’re talking about. Ramping vaccine production is going to be a function of: (1) process yield, (2) process cycle time, (3) manufacturing capacity, and (4) supply chain capacity.

Best case:
Moderna’s mRNA vaccine is likely the best case scenario for ramping demand. Amidite (RNA bases) supply chains are fairly strong and can ramp up if needed and it’s fairly straightforward to ramp mRNA synthesis / processing, so that will almost certainly not be a limiting factor at the time of approval. It’d probably be a 2-3 month manufacturing campaign for 250M doses, and they’d almost certainly have that campaign started or even completed prior to approval.

Worst case:
It requires a low yield egg based manufacturing process. For the flu vaccine (which will still need to be produced) they use about 900,000 eggs per day for 6-9 months to produce about 150M doses. If a COVID-19 vaccine’s yield was less than that of the yearly flu’s it would just take longer to produce the same amount of doses, so bottom line: At least a year for 250M doses, but probably longer (and much longer if there are supply problems with eggs / processing equipment)."

Hi! me and some other grad students have been discussing this for the last half hour. It's likely due to some kind of colour constancy illusion, where some people are perceiving the context to be something like ""lit by blueish daylight"" and others are perceiving it to be something like ""under yellow department store lights."" In the former case, your brain will try and get the objective (if such a thing can be said) colour by subtracting out the blue as a shadow, and in the latter case it will do the same thing for the filigree by subtracting out the yellow as a reflection. This is a common illusion in psych : [See here](http://www.echalk.co.uk/amusements/OpticalIllusions/colourPerception/colourPerception.html). but it's not seen that often 'in the wild,' even though your brain does this constantly.

"The short answer is that we don't, at least not all of us.  I certainly don't. 2C is incredibly ambitious at this point, so I'm actually with you.  

However, the reasoning behind it is that CO2 to temperature isn't as simple as a 1 to 1 relationship where a CO2 level of X leads to a temperature of Y.  There are many factors in play, of which CO2 is just one.  More of it will always lead to a temperature increase, but the end value depends on a lot more, stuff like how much ice exists near the poles, solar energy, all kinds of stuff.  

So in a previous ""configuration"", this CO2 level will have led to warmer temperatures at times, and probably colder temperatures at times. But in this configuration, this is what we get at this level of CO2. "

"An imperfect match will still elicit imperfect antibodies.  Imperfect antibodies simply bind and neutralize the virus less effectively than perfect ones, but they still do it.  Thus the intensity and duration of your flu will be less, since your body will still have a head start on fighting it off compared to having no anti-flu antibodies.  A perfect match is no guarantee of total protection either by the way.  It still gives your body the best head start possible, but if you happen to get a particularly huge dose of virus at initial infection, the virus could still outrun your immune response.

This is why it is important to get your flu shot every single year, even if it isn’t perfectly effective every year.  Each year you get a flu shot acts like a booster for every year in the future in which you may be exposed to flu.

"Ant colonies can die off in a variety of ways. Mites, other forms of parasites, ant wars, death of the queen, lack of food or sugar or water, predators, disease, and so many more. A colony can usually grow proportionate to its amount of resources, and room to roam. I am not sure how old the oldest ant colony is, but many colonies in captivity have survived for many years. Most colonies with only a single queen only last until her death. This is due to the fact that queen alates(young queen ants and their male equivalents) participate in yearly nuptial flights when they leave to mate. Male alates die right after this, but female alates that do make begin an entirely new colony, with only a few eggs to start.

"Yes, if my understanding of this article is correct:
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/science/25qna.html 
(I hope nytimes is an acceptable source, even if not academic)

In the linked article, John D. Kubiatowicz, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley says that for a kindle with 4 Gigabyte memory, this would mean a rough increase in weight of 10^–18 grams.

For your situation of a 60GB phone, this would mean 
(60Gb/4Gb) * (10^-18 grams) = 1.5 × 10^-17 grams.  So certainly less than what you would be able to feel.

While I originally thought this would be because the storage would use extra electrons, the article/Prof. Kubiatowicz say otherwise:

""Although the total number of electrons in the memory does not change as the stored data changes,” Dr. Kubiatowicz said, the trapped ones have a higher energy than the untrapped ones. A conservative estimate of the difference would be 10^–15 joules per bit.

""As the equation E=mc2 makes clear, this energy is equivalent to mass and will have weight.""

It is my understanding that most/all mobile phones use flash memory for storage so the linked article about flash memory in Kindles would be applicable here.  Please let me know (or just delete this outright) if I am mistaken.

"The images intrigued me, so I've looked into your query. It went a bit beyond chemistry, but science often does that, with phenomena crossing over between fields.

First, it's important to note that this is not a crystalline solid, but rather an amorphous solid that you have: it's not a crystal structure / habit that's directing the structure that you have here! As coconut oil is [composed of a mixture of different fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_oil#Composition_and_comparison), it's highly unlikely that you would obtain a single crystal from it -- although sometimes single components may selectively crystallize: *e.g.* you can observe one component of olive oil precipitate when cooled.

So we have a different process directing the structure here. It should be noted that hexagonal packing in 2D is the most efficient, hence it tends to be a natural default. But first let's look at why it's not just a continuous solid...


Typically (although water is not typical!) when a liquid solidifies, its density increases. [Lauric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauric_acid), the main component in coconut oil has a density of 1.007 g/cm^3 at 24 C, while at 50 C, it's density is 0.8679 g/cm^3 . That means as the liquid cools and solidifies, it is also contracting. When a material contracts due to temperature differences, it can create significant stress, as exemplified with [this hot Pyrex measuring cup being quickly cooled with cold water, and shattering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPetc9bpu5s) because of the stress induced quickly cooling.

If we envision a surface contracting in 2D, there are two possible modes of contraction: either the whole sheet/surface can contract (essentially scaling down to a smaller version -- rare/unlikely), or the contraction can be localized (occurring at multiple points). Here's a [figure illustrating whole-sheet contraction vs localized contraction](http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/1121ColumnarJointing.jpeg). On average, the centres of contraction (when localized) will be [equally-spaced](http://www.nvcc.edu/home/cbentley/shenandoah/columnar_jointing.jpg), resulting in a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) which breaks the surface into polygons - if the centres are all equally spaced, the Voronoi diagram will be packed hexagons, such as in [these breath figure patterns](http://i.imgur.com/ESQqQTf.gif) (source doi: [10.1021/la035915g](http://www.doi.org/10.1021/la035915g)). 

The columnar shape is formed because there is a distinct direction of heat flow, with the material cooling from top to bottom, as shown in [this figure](http://www.engr.usask.ca/~reeves/prog/geoe118/images/joint4.gif). The result is that the joints (edges of the pologons; fissures; cracks) propagate downward as the (cooler) temperature front progresses toward the bottom of the jar. From the image posted, it appears that the joints are filled with higher-melting fatty acids. 

The result of this process of *cooling, contraction, and joint formation* can actually be observed in nature in the form of [columnar basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt#Columnar_basalt) (also referred to as ""columnar jointing"" of basalt). Examples such as [Giant's Causeway](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Drury_-_View_of_the_Giant%27s_Causeway.jpg) in Ireland or [Devil's Tower](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Devils_Tower_CROP.jpg) in Wyoming. You can read up a bit about columnar basalt in [this post](http://blogs.agu.org/georneys/2012/11/18/geology-word-of-the-week-c-is-for-columnar-jointing/) by the American Geophysical Union, or [this good roundup from 2010](http://www.wired.com/2010/10/columns-not-just-for-basalt-anymore/) in Wired. Given the connection to columnar basalt, I think that we should actually get a specialist in geology to comment here...

"Whoa something I can answer - I worked on the Lunar Greenhouse Module at the University of Arizona! 

Bioregenerative Life Support Systems could continually produce oxygen and some amount of food (our goal was always atmospheric conditioning with food production as a windfall of that). In fact, you kind of have to decide if you'd like the plants to focus on growing leaves for oxygen production or fruits for food production. Either way, there are a lot of challenges in feeding those plants. We proposed using composters to recycle human waste to make the system fully sustainable, as plants ""breathe"" pure water out which could then be utilized as drinking water as well. I don't know all the details about that part of it, as that wasn't my section. We also intended to use Fresnel lenses with fiber optic cables to deliver sunlight directly to the plants, with blue and red LEDs as a backup (it'd be placed underground because the moon lacks an atmosphere to burn up space debris).

Unfortunately, hydroponics would have difficulty in a low gravity environment like the ISS without some real specialized design, which the plants may not like. The moon would give us an environment that is a little more familiar to us and the plants.

">  A battery is two poles in an acid.

This is wrong- Alkaline batteries use a base as an electrolyte.  In fact the only common batteries that use acid are lead batteries.  There are more batteries using basic electrolytes than acidic electrolytes.  Lithium batteries use neutral electrolytes.

The reason alkaline batteries regenerate voltage is that they are [big cans full of powder](http://pediaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Difference-Between-Rechargeable-and-Non-Rechargeable-Batteries-Alkaline_battery_cross_section.png).  In operation, there's a chemical flow towards the ""nail"" in the center of the battery.  When the power gets low, that flow is slower than the discharge, which raises internal resistance, making the problem worse.  When you briefly disconnect the battery, it allows that chemical flow to equalize and the internal resistance falls.  That gives you a head start on the rising internal resistance, and the battery can last quite a long time more.  However the powder in the battery is far to dense to be shaken up.  This also doesn't work in rechargeable cells because those are filled with [many, many layers](https://opentextbc.ca/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2016/05/CNX_Chem_17_05_NiCd.jpg) of battery, and the chemical flow doesn't lag behind the electron flow.

Even devices that are ""off"" tend to still pull a lot of power from the battery, so fully disconnecting it is important."

Nice read. Quoting it:

>Even with low power density, we could theoretically fill a warehouse-sized building with millions of NDBs and hook them up to the electrical grid. This would provide steady power for thousands of years.

>Probably it will all come down to cost-effectiveness.

>**Ten microwatts per cubic centimeter is not a lot of electricity, but it’s not nothing either**. Clearly, you won’t be powering a cell phone, let alone a car, with such a power density. So what is this company talking about? While I have yet to see an interview or report that says so explicitly – **the nuclear diamond battery must be incorporated into a regular chemical battery, like a lithium-ion battery**. This actually makes perfect sense, and is a great idea. So the chemical battery provides the power density and the output to power the device, and the embedded NDB slowly recharges the battery. The company claims – “**With the same size battery, it would charge your battery from zero to full, five times an hour**.” This sounds like a claim that needs to be verified, and seems to be out of proportion to the typical power density of such devices.

But I agree

>I am always skeptical of claims that a technology can be “scaled up”

"Everything /u/electric_ionland said is perfectly right. But let me add a bit more here. For background, I'm at JPL and I did my graduate degree in bioastronautics, so I spent a spot of time studying life support design.

1. The human body: The body enjoys being ""normoxic"", which is a partial pressure of oxygen at about 3.0PSI. (21% of 14.4 PSI). So as long as you have 3PSI of O2, the human body is happy.
2. Structural design: Engineers want to reduce the pressure (well, the pressure gradient between inside and outside) as much as possible to reduce requirements on strength and thus, reduce mass.
3. Flammability: The burning rate of material in a high-oxygen environment is a function of O2 percentage, not partial pressure. There's a large knee in the curve at about 36% where the burn rate markedly increases. As such, NASA has set the limit for oxygen concentration at 30%, with notable exceptions.

These three requirements in mind, lead to different solutions:

 \- Apollo operated at \~5PSI at 100% O2. They solved the flammability risk by minimizing ignition sources and removing flammable material. On the launch pad they started with 19PSI (to check seals) at a N2/O2 environment. Then, during ascent, depressurized the system to 5PSI and back-filled with pure O2.

\- Shuttle EVA suit: This operated at 4.3PSI at 100% O2. Higher pressures make it harder to bend limbs as the astronaut has to compress the atmosphere in the suit to move.

 \- Shuttle: Operated nominally at 14.4PSI 21%O2/79%N2. This was to maintain an Earth-like atmosphere for research. However, when preparing for EVAs, they would reduce the pressure to 10PSI and increase the O2 concentration to 30% for 24h before the EVA. This was to help the astronauts get N2 out of their bloodstream to prevent the bends (think scuba diving). Astronauts going on EVA would then huff pure O2 for \~2hr prior to the EVA to flush N2 out of their blood.

\- ISS: Operates at 14.4PSI, 21%O2/79%N2. Not sure how they prevent the bends for EVAs, but probably something similar.

Hope this helps."

"In theory yes, bacteria can be crushed just like anything. When using microscope slides it's possible to crush them if you don't do it properly. But those are incredibly smooth surfaces. Your fingers are not. There are visible grooves and grooves and imperfections so small you can't see them. Your fingers also have a fair bit of give to them as do the cells that make them up. So most, if not all, of the bacteria present will not experience much force. Not to say it couldn't happen in the right circumstances though. 

To have a good chance of crushing them you need a material that is rigid and so flat that they won't just be pushed into grooves or holes.

"As a flood engineer i wish i came here sooner to answer a few questions. 

But the main thing is that a number of vectors will remove the water due to gravity.   Namely sewers, ground drains, good old evaporation, lay of the land, local ground geology, tidal differences to name a few.  Once the hurricane has passed though then levels will drop fairly quickly.

The biggest problem will be both the environmental (mobilised sewage etc...) and physical property damage that has occured.

Lots of standing water means mozzies and vermin.  Contaminated waters means polluted ground water sources, damaged agriculture infrastructure, dead livestock, crops wiped out and quarantined/destroyed  (certain crops absorb harmful nasties). 

Infrastructure wise lots of work gutting out the drainage system and clearing hurricane damage will take place. Damaged electricity/phone/gas infrastructure will need checking too.  

Now let's talk about the houses that are damaged. 

There are typical damage assessments that can be done but there are 2 typical factors that ultimately determine damage costs and severity - the depth of water and the time water stays around (ok and type of building materials used)

Anything typically above 400mm for a day or 2 means that the lower floor needs gutting and requires a complete rework.

Now think of this in terms of demands locally.  Every homeless person will  need rehousing, every house will require skilled trades to repair them(and they WILL be in  demand). It will take years for all affected properties to be repaired by all trades.

But as a starter for then why not google what happened during hurricane katrina or the 2005 flooding carlisle in the UK.  Some of the stats are just mindblowing and heartbreaking.

Ps also google the lake levels rises during hurricane Katrina due to the low air pressure alone.  It makes for amazing reading.
