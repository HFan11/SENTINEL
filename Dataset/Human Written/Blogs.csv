"Another week just flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, i am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from wednesday. I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better then i expected. Then we watched gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
"Summer tv tv in the summer used to be a dead zone full of repeats or something. But now there are two great new shows on tv and i have been watching both religiously for the last week. Blow out the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist jonothan antin wants build a second location to his incredibly popular west hollywood salon but this time in beverly hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not i, but as i was flipping thru the channels i caught a glipse of jonothan, equally narcissistic and dull looking at a empty space on rodeo dr speak (in a public voice) 'i am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and i was hooked. Not since rocco have i found such a moron compelling tv watching."
"What a week ... My right shoulder has tendonitus. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when i move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer .... It kills me. I can't move it much now because i was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely get up strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but i'll get better. My mom's surgery went ok. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon."
"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how very quickly the simplest things can become a freaking ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being sweet. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, i'm not surper sure i'll ever be bathing again so it's not like there was even an olefactory incentive there! i am doing two things right now. I am composing an post and i am also watching the collected no doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."
"So it is 11:14pm mst, and here i sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that i mind doing it, but i wonder sometimes at how often i find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to love and minister to people this way, but where is the line drawn where it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of? the last couple of weeks, i've been staying up late reading and such, so i was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until i realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* no rest for the weary, right? so i found myself watching joe schmo 2 again tonight."
"Remind me, what did i write about before this? or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga so, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, i forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before pat shows up to lunch, dustin starts talking about what a nice guy pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding and realizing that we're talking more about finding dustin's best friend a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror and then silently asked myself: am i being pawned off to the other guy? is this what happens now?"
"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually.. I'd like each and every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day, and if they're not prepared to, i'd like very much that they'd hop the fuck back in bed, and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No i'm not the smartest motherfucker in the world... But i'm not talking about things that take a lot of brain power, so i think its fair to persecute the inanely stupid. Lets see if i can keep this particular rant to a few particular types, and we'll save some for another day, sound good? great."
"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Urllink robert rubin told npr's marketplace today that bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle income persons. Ah, robert rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? it'll come to you... 2. We can't give the republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
"'she's saying i'm on the run, i'm chasing guys for fun' ~the offspring umm haven't updated in awhile but not much to say.. Went to the cove to see supernothing, they were good as usual, got to chill with tiago :-).. Sat. Went to work and then out w/ joe and rach, met up with steve, tiago and tom.. Came home at like quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet.. Got there a little late but it's all good, i did my full on floor and didn't fall, second on floor and vault and third on beam, 29.45 all around which isn't bad bc my meets get better as the season goes on.."
"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? like you're sitting in math class bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? and you realize that you exist and you are in math class and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you-the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? i hate that. You know what else i hate? block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
"I think that monpoly has run it's course in my life and i vow to never lay my hands on that damn iron (not a hot one but the piece in the game) again. Tonight andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the farquin game, or maybe i let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well how ever the story goes it can't compare to this texas sized headache i have at the moment, i've taken some aleve and i must say that they are doing the trick, all i need now is some well deserved r&r your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive in"
"Well... Today's been a long day. We had to drive home from indiana. I guess i'm gonna sort of have to be choosy what i write about because i could really take up a lot of time and space and i just don't have enough energy. First off i have to say that camp was awesome and even better than i could have expected. God's been doing so much stuff in my life lately and it's just awesome. I've sort of turned over a new leaf i guess, but anyway's back to the beginning. We arrived at the twiggs' house on friday evening and we stayed until we left for camp on monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, walmart and watched movies."
"Today is my last day of summer vacation! waaaaaa! and i have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but i'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think up for 'hell's no, me's don wanna go' to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, i love excelling at everything i do. But starting new things is a bitch. I hate being a pawn (like i told cassie: 'i'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and i hate not knowing what's going on."
"Arun shourie talks about how, the present governor of uttar pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a urllink ' third islamic state ' in the subcontinent . T v rajeswar, the former head of the intelligence bureau and the present governor of uttar pradesh had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the hindustan times, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he says, does the fact that you now know that he, and not i, to say nothing of mr advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? or do you conclude that because he wrote in this refrain, t v rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as governor of uttar pradesh?"
"Attitude: bored mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight been a long hard day in the trenches here today folks, almost no time to write anything for you readers. However it's good to see tigger(now akcron) taking up the reigns herself and making an appearance and talking about things :) not much to say about things, yesterday was shakespeare on the green, was a lovely play, but i had to leave before closing curtain, which kinda sucked, hopefully someday i'll see the entirety of a shakespeare play. But i digress. Akcron is right about the problems with the shower, it sucks, in terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self torture can be pretty entertaining."
"All of a sudden, for the past two days, i have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone dead exhaustion. Last evening, i went home, and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when i woke up, it was all dark, and i hadn't switched the lights on, so i could not figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why i'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when i came. Although in calcutta i hear it's been raining for the past three days."
"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater i was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time i got to the arm holes and the mohair was knotting itself together as i knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of sex and the city (way to go, library!). And then i got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose i could say i learned a lot while trying to do this sweater."
"Last night in class, we were discussing that week’s assigned reading, urllink getting back into place: toward a renewed study of the place-world, by edward s. Casey . The first chapter deals with “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” in the first chapter, casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He is trying to make the case that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community. (that is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) so far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."
"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? not i, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
"Currently listening to: the little drummer boy by stevan pasero ...and now my post... Senate republicans okay, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations wankathon last week? i know i didn't. Well, okay - i did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by republicans who, pissed off that democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of bush's nutjob justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind the fact that the democrats have already approved 168 of bush's judicial nominees - nooo, that's not good enough for the power-mad republicans who are for some reason laboring under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
"This was a good weekend. I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, i listened to a lot of nevermore (something i should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - bruce sterling's heavy weather, larry niven's world of ptavvs and octavia butler's parable of the sower. Heavy weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future usa, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, i must confess that i failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, i guess."
Coz' this is the aftermath the first week back from practicum was a struggle but it is only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken but with the eventual meeting with the course co-ordinator allowed me to release my burden and by doing so i have&nbsp;prevented another person being stuck with such a pedagogically deficit practicum school. Yesterday (monday) i bumped into another agrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it will be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first.
"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for supposed stress relieving activities. I've found that i really suck at 8-ball and ping pong! rick(the canuck) beats my ass on a regular basis - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a 'quick round'. Last night i participated in an 8-ball tournament over at the hot spot (our recreation tent - complete with popcorn machine, numerous tv's, jukebox, dvd rental, pool table, dart board, and ever present ping pong table). Anyway, i was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game - until i scratched on the eight ball ;( i still had a fairly good time - the most fun was the two dutch soldiers that joined in the tournament."
"Fall 1974: i was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then nor am i now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. So as i struggled to make sense out of algebra the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and just as i was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my sub conscious the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and once again no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."
"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent tuesday-thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, these are the things i need to consider as i spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had i known i was going to move prior to the end of my school year, i would have discarded much of the books and supplies i no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room. So she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"
"You can't help it, you can't evade it: a piece of you will always live in me. Even if i never carried you child, even if i was never married to you, even if i was never an official pair to you ... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will i always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach ... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever i get the feeling of a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me ... And still remains. .. For heri"
"I'm uncomfortable. Investigative reporting seems very wrong to me. Or let me rephrase that, the article i'm doing and it's consequences is not exactly something i'm comfortable with. Perhaps it is because i don't believe in it enough, that i cannot really get the complete feel for it. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that shit. They put you in jail with all these internal security acts. I am not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, i am not the easiest person to get along with."
"We had an outing yesterday with my co-employees at the bank. We went to guintubdan, la carolota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked for the falls. It was a 30 minute or so walk. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! but we made it. The water was chilly ice. You can feel your body getting numb because of the coldness. We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked calming and the whole scene is indeed breathtaking. Its like you can hear yourself being one with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with mother earth. The cold air and water were enough to make you be lulled to sleep."
"Well i am sure my sisters are drunk off their butts. Today was pride in san diego. I know my sisters and when it is drinking time, it is drinking time. It is the one thing i didn't get from the buenviajes, the want to drink. There are few times i don't mind drinking but let's just say they are very rare times. So we have a month left before ed leaves. I think it is starting to sink in with ed and with all of us. I think it sunk in with me a long time ago. I just hope that ed will be here for bailey's surgery. We have been keeping an eye on his swelling and there definitely is quite a bit of swelling."
"Saturday we took connor to firemans park, thinking that the fireman's easter egg hunt was to start at 11am. It turned out it was on the friday. Thank goodness i brought a bag of eggs with me just incase. So connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning when he woke up he was so excited that the easter bunny had come. There is nothing better then to see the excitement on your childs face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the 'easter bunny' is fun and all. We do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was megan's first easter, she looked so cute dressed in her jean dress and stockings :)"
"Friday november 22, 2002 woohoo, my boots are at the house! i forgot and had them delivered to my house instead of work so i have to wait another 4 hours to get them. Argh! these are the face boots, and tredair flame boots. I rock! i somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily i'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air. If not, they're going to change my tire and slap the spare on it. Thankfully my spare is full sized. I may get to buy a new tire tonight, woohoo! hamad tire here i come! i thought i had found another vw."
"I know in a previous post i protected parents, almost even taking their side, well here's my little change of mind. Parents don't know anything. They think they know you soooo well, maybe even to the point where they can read emotions off your face. They can't. Parents know nothing about us. And when i go upstairs after arguing with nicole about kelli, like i just did a few minutes ago, and they want me to tell them what's wrong. Yeah, how about you shut the fuck up!? i don't have to tell you what's wrong all the time. Here's the situation with nicole and kelli. Kelli and nicole don't like each other. At all."
"Music for the day: 94.7 fm &nbsp; almost didn't make it to work on time. There's some kinda huge accident at 14th and constitution that is making traffic hell in virginia. Thankfully i was able to skillyfully get my car from the far left lane to the far right, and was able to get my ass onto route 50. All of this, of course, means nothing to anyone unless you live around here...so nevermind. Basically i am happy to be sitting here as opposed to still sitting in my car. Yesterday sara decided to google me...and lo and behold, the email i wrote to ivan meisel on espn.com was published online! i had no idea; i thought it wasn't the most well-written argument but i guess someone thought otherwise."

"> what can i say... Harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was bloody brillant!! i went to see it right after school on friday. Yes, that's right i saw it on the opening day!! (thanks mike for the ticket) daniel radcliffe aka harry potter had grown up soo fast and he is sooo cute!! malofy too haha. Okay well... The movie was all the great i give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important details!! overall, the movie was good... I didn't really dress up to get the movie but i was wearing a ravenclaw tie even though, i like gryffindors better. I might go see the movie again like in 2 more weeks."
"Pears and peanut butter attempt #2. I have hard pears this time, and my own jar of peanut butter which i can dip the pears into, but it is still crunchy peanut butter not smooth and i definitely think it makes a difference. I am also slightly perturbed as i thought this was a healthy snack and have just noticed that per 5th of a jar (and our jars are way smaller) as in per 100g there are 614 calories!!!!!!!!!! don't think about it. Have just got back from an evening out at my old music teacher/friend's house. Yes i know... I missed er for that- but i did tape it! have also discovered that they are showing repeats of series 9 every morning at 9:55! was good seeing my friend, strange but good."
"Urllink some people are jumping to connect urllink this dot : the urllink organization for security and cooperation in europe was invited to monitor the election by the state department. The observers will come from the osce's office for democratic institutions and human rights. It will be the first time such a team has been present for a u.s. Presidential election. With urllink this dot : a baker's dozen of congressional democrats, among them four new yorkers, has petitioned u.n. Secretary- general kofi annan to dispatch international observers to florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree. Based on the info available, the osce seems to be coming here to learn from the u.s. Election process, not to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for u.n."
"My heinous mood has passed. Forthcoming period + forgetting to take prozac until late in the day = very sad, prone to tears kristin. But surprise of boyfriend at my doorstep + ice cream sundae + holding boyfriend's hand after i had a terribly scary dream in which people started shooting machine guns at the news bureau = kristin feeling better. And i don't have to work this morning la la la la la but i do have to call a man at kmiz to get his rate card. And tonight i get to see two of my best girls, amy and kate (hopefully with time to study in between). And tomorrow maybe i will see someone i haven't seen for quite awhile for our ww date."
"So, a lot has been going on with me... So, debbie like fought with me over what china i was allowed to use. I mean come on do you pull out enough expensive china to feed a ientire frickin' black bapist choir! so, anyways she had dishes galore! saucers, tea pots, coffee cups, wine goblets, water glasses, 7 different types of forks and spoons, dinner plates, salad plate, dessert plate, soup bowl, side bowl... I was like omfg! and, then she yells at me for eating appetizers as the turkey was cooking! i was like i will eat trust me, grarrg! so, then to the hospital with my father."
"Gop gets scolded on recruitment naturalization ceremonies in jacksonville are to be relocated after complaints that gop activists registered new citizens as republicans. By gary fineout and alfonso chardy the citizenship ceremony in jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop. All of it was suspicious to linda cross, who was there to watch her husband, dario cruz, take his citizenship oath."
"Hi all, one good news in store for you. I am taking up the role of pl for my project from coming monday. My present pl is going to onsite day after tomorrow, that's y.

"So its not really hooky, but i've been accumulating sub-days and decided to cash one in today, wednesday the 10th in japan (the post-time gives the u.s. Date, so its technically not correct), so i can just goof-off for a couple of days. Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get ones creative energy back. I have it good for a forgeiner, and my timing was good, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall in my lap. I know i am getting ripped off, though. I'm not blind to that fact. Getting hungry. Might go get some mexican food at speak easy, the 'american style' diner just across the street from the post office in my little prefecture."
I have always prided myself in making anyone that frequents casa pescatore as comforable as possible. I want them to make sure they feel at home as they will feel in their prospective residence. Yesterday- i hope i succeeded. The masses all congregated on perry ave with what many consider ' extreme prejudice'. 4:30pm was the time my best friend eric and his son nunu came over with a huge pan of baked ziti. The tables were set and i had all the food that i cooked and the bells were ringing crazy. Before i could blink - my best friend from florida walked through the door and that made me smile. I missed that motherfucker so much. The bonus was him bringing his wife along. She is expecting and this is the closest i could get to being an uncle. I spoiled that girl with tray after tray of food and tiramisu.
"I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch. As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."
"Prom is tomorrow.... I hope it is goona be fun.. That is all i ask. Rob gets here may 14th..... Yeah 3 weeks today.... Oh god i think i am giving myself an ulcer thinking about it. But i am so excited to see him, scared to yes, but tres excited. Leafs played last night.... But becuase calgary was playing at the same time and i am out on the west coast.... I had to watch the calgary game, not the leaf game.... Which is alright i guess.. Considering my leafs lost.. And that makes me sad. But philly is a good team.. So... I still have bragging rights.. They made it farther then the damn canucks! today is a crazy day..."
"Ok, so i have yet to see what my blog will actually look like. But apparently, this is the place to start. I am not quite sure what will be happening here; whether i will take to it and whatnot, but since i spend so much of my time in front of a machine, i might as well make proper use of my time and post all these bits of craziness that whiz around, nay stumble around more like, in my head. I was insipired by a blogger (who i never met in person), who managed to keep us up to date in the most intimate fashion about her day to day existance, and somewhat entertained at the same time..."
"1. Everyone is obsessed with one movie or series of movies, what's yours? evil dead series.. If it wasn't obvious. (i have one of the largest 'stuff from that movie series' collections ever) 2. Can you play an instrument? what is it? bass guitar, oh yes, i rock out. 3. Biggest money wasting vice? either my compulsive buying of dvds or any new technology. 4. Have any phobias, allergies, or compulsive behaviors? no, no, and i must bank-face all moneys in my wallet in order from least to greatest at all times. 5. How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? because i said so."
"Holla so i saw troy tonight with my family...i was not impressed. I'm too tired to go way into specifics, but i do think it had potential. However, i think too much energy was spent on the set (which was magnificent) and not enough on creating a solidifying tone, theme, etc. It retold the story, but it was not particularly gripping, and i don't feel like i gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, i thought the score was poor, and was basically a knock-off of the gladiator. The gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman and it worked b/c it backed up and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."
"Urllink lets all give a big hello to the newest atom/rdf/rss reader on the block, urllink pulpfiction 1.0 from urllink freshly squeezed software . It looks like it has a lot of native app goodness. It should be noted that it is not free or free, since that seems to be a 'hot topic' on the interweb again. You can try it for 15 days and then go back to something else, or pony up $25 if you like it. A feature that jumps out at me right away is how each post is its own entity, and can be moved around, stored, labeled, and even deleted. I could easily see how this would make some news tracker type people very happy. It imports and exports opml, as you might expect."
"Today... I miss my sister terribly - it just seems strange not to have her hanging around, irritating me (just joking...). Even though it was only for a week, she really made her presence felt, and i mean that in a good way. Just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently - last week in fact. Maybe it's just the thought that i won't see her for quite a while - with her going to bristol in sept/oct and all. She represented, on a deeper level, a link to my family back home. Oh how i miss them all. Tomorrow is the start of a new term. How did the holidays fly by so quickly?"
"Ever have one of those days when you just don't know what the... What the... Anything? no? well then you should skip the rest of this because it won't make any sense to you. To those of you choosing to continue on i offer the following observation. ' sometimes i wish i'd been given the manual .' manuals, if done correctly at least, let you know: what things are for, what they can do, how they do the things they do, what happens if you push button x or y, what to do if things aren't doing what they're supposed to the phone number and email address of the omniscient guru who can solve every problem very useful information. Unfortunately i didn't get a manual with me."
"And there's nothing wrong with pcs -- if i were a full-bore gamer with time to do such a thing, i'd certainly have a pc system for the wealth of available games. Though except for a few unique products, that huge wall of games at compusa starts getting repetetive after a while -- at first i'm envious, then i start noticing that it's really just a lot of different flavors of the same soda...first-person shooters, mystery games, strategy games, simulations. There are so many variations of age of empires it becomes comical. Aoe -- with orcs! aoe -- with spaceships! aoe -- with fuzzy wombats! it's like the endless movie trailers that begin with the line: 'in a world...'"
"Another week just flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, i am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from wednesday. I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better then i expected. Then we watched gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
"Summer tv tv in the summer used to be a dead zone full of repeats or something. But now there are two great new shows on tv and i have been watching both religiously for the last week. Blow out the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist jonothan antin wants build a second location to his incredibly popular west hollywood salon but this time in beverly hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not i, but as i was flipping thru the channels i caught a glipse of jonothan, equally narcissistic and dull looking at a empty space on rodeo dr speak (in a public voice) 'i am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and i was hooked. Not since rocco have i found such a moron compelling tv watching."
"What a week ... My right shoulder has tendonitus. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when i move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer .... It kills me. I can't move it much now because i was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely get up strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but i'll get better. My mom's surgery went ok. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon."
"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how very quickly the simplest things can become a freaking ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being sweet. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, i'm not surper sure i'll ever be bathing again so it's not like there was even an olefactory incentive there! i am doing two things right now. I am composing an post and i am also watching the collected no doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."
"So it is 11:14pm mst, and here i sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that i mind doing it, but i wonder sometimes at how often i find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to love and minister to people this way, but where is the line drawn where it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of? the last couple of weeks, i've been staying up late reading and such, so i was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until i realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* no rest for the weary, right? so i found myself watching joe schmo 2 again tonight."
"Remind me, what did i write about before this? or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga so, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, i forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before pat shows up to lunch, dustin starts talking about what a nice guy pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding and realizing that we're talking more about finding dustin's best friend a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror and then silently asked myself: am i being pawned off to the other guy? is this what happens now?"
"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually.. I'd like each and every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day, and if they're not prepared to, i'd like very much that they'd hop the fuck back in bed, and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No i'm not the smartest motherfucker in the world... But i'm not talking about things that take a lot of brain power, so i think its fair to persecute the inanely stupid. Lets see if i can keep this particular rant to a few particular types, and we'll save some for another day, sound good? great."
"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Urllink robert rubin told npr's marketplace today that bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle income persons. Ah, robert rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? it'll come to you... 2. We can't give the republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
"'she's saying i'm on the run, i'm chasing guys for fun' ~the offspring umm haven't updated in awhile but not much to say.. Went to the cove to see supernothing, they were good as usual, got to chill with tiago :-).. Sat. Went to work and then out w/ joe and rach, met up with steve, tiago and tom.. Came home at like quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet.. Got there a little late but it's all good, i did my full on floor and didn't fall, second on floor and vault and third on beam, 29.45 all around which isn't bad bc my meets get better as the season goes on.."
"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? like you're sitting in math class bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? and you realize that you exist and you are in math class and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you-the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? i hate that. You know what else i hate? block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
"I think that monpoly has run it's course in my life and i vow to never lay my hands on that damn iron (not a hot one but the piece in the game) again. Tonight andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the farquin game, or maybe i let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well how ever the story goes it can't compare to this texas sized headache i have at the moment, i've taken some aleve and i must say that they are doing the trick, all i need now is some well deserved r&r your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive in"
"Well... Today's been a long day. We had to drive home from indiana. I guess i'm gonna sort of have to be choosy what i write about because i could really take up a lot of time and space and i just don't have enough energy. First off i have to say that camp was awesome and even better than i could have expected. God's been doing so much stuff in my life lately and it's just awesome. I've sort of turned over a new leaf i guess, but anyway's back to the beginning. We arrived at the twiggs' house on friday evening and we stayed until we left for camp on monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, walmart and watched movies."
"Today is my last day of summer vacation! waaaaaa! and i have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but i'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think up for 'hell's no, me's don wanna go' to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, i love excelling at everything i do. But starting new things is a bitch. I hate being a pawn (like i told cassie: 'i'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and i hate not knowing what's going on."
"Arun shourie talks about how, the present governor of uttar pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a urllink ' third islamic state ' in the subcontinent . T v rajeswar, the former head of the intelligence bureau and the present governor of uttar pradesh had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the hindustan times, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he says, does the fact that you now know that he, and not i, to say nothing of mr advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? or do you conclude that because he wrote in this refrain, t v rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as governor of uttar pradesh?"
"Attitude: bored mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight been a long hard day in the trenches here today folks, almost no time to write anything for you readers. However it's good to see tigger(now akcron) taking up the reigns herself and making an appearance and talking about things :) not much to say about things, yesterday was shakespeare on the green, was a lovely play, but i had to leave before closing curtain, which kinda sucked, hopefully someday i'll see the entirety of a shakespeare play. But i digress. Akcron is right about the problems with the shower, it sucks, in terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self torture can be pretty entertaining."
"All of a sudden, for the past two days, i have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone dead exhaustion. Last evening, i went home, and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when i woke up, it was all dark, and i hadn't switched the lights on, so i could not figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why i'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when i came. Although in calcutta i hear it's been raining for the past three days."
"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater i was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time i got to the arm holes and the mohair was knotting itself together as i knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of sex and the city (way to go, library!). And then i got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose i could say i learned a lot while trying to do this sweater."
"Last night in class, we were discussing that week’s assigned reading, urllink getting back into place: toward a renewed study of the place-world, by edward s. Casey . The first chapter deals with “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” in the first chapter, casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He is trying to make the case that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community. (that is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) so far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."
"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? not i, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
"Currently listening to: the little drummer boy by stevan pasero ...and now my post... Senate republicans okay, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations wankathon last week? i know i didn't. Well, okay - i did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by republicans who, pissed off that democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of bush's nutjob justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind the fact that the democrats have already approved 168 of bush's judicial nominees - nooo, that's not good enough for the power-mad republicans who are for some reason laboring under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
"This was a good weekend. I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, i listened to a lot of nevermore (something i should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - bruce sterling's heavy weather, larry niven's world of ptavvs and octavia butler's parable of the sower. Heavy weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future usa, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, i must confess that i failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, i guess."
Coz' this is the aftermath the first week back from practicum was a struggle but it is only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken but with the eventual meeting with the course co-ordinator allowed me to release my burden and by doing so i have&nbsp;prevented another person being stuck with such a pedagogically deficit practicum school. Yesterday (monday) i bumped into another agrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it will be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first.
"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for supposed stress relieving activities. I've found that i really suck at 8-ball and ping pong! rick(the canuck) beats my ass on a regular basis - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a 'quick round'. Last night i participated in an 8-ball tournament over at the hot spot (our recreation tent - complete with popcorn machine, numerous tv's, jukebox, dvd rental, pool table, dart board, and ever present ping pong table). Anyway, i was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game - until i scratched on the eight ball ;( i still had a fairly good time - the most fun was the two dutch soldiers that joined in the tournament."
"Fall 1974: i was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then nor am i now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. So as i struggled to make sense out of algebra the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and just as i was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my sub conscious the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and once again no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."
"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent tuesday-thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, these are the things i need to consider as i spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had i known i was going to move prior to the end of my school year, i would have discarded much of the books and supplies i no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room. So she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"
"You can't help it, you can't evade it: a piece of you will always live in me. Even if i never carried you child, even if i was never married to you, even if i was never an official pair to you ... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will i always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach ... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever i get the feeling of a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me ... And still remains. .. For heri"
"I'm uncomfortable. Investigative reporting seems very wrong to me. Or let me rephrase that, the article i'm doing and it's consequences is not exactly something i'm comfortable with. Perhaps it is because i don't believe in it enough, that i cannot really get the complete feel for it. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that shit. They put you in jail with all these internal security acts. I am not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, i am not the easiest person to get along with."
"We had an outing yesterday with my co-employees at the bank. We went to guintubdan, la carolota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked for the falls. It was a 30 minute or so walk. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! but we made it. The water was chilly ice. You can feel your body getting numb because of the coldness. We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked calming and the whole scene is indeed breathtaking. Its like you can hear yourself being one with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with mother earth. The cold air and water were enough to make you be lulled to sleep."
"Well i am sure my sisters are drunk off their butts. Today was pride in san diego. I know my sisters and when it is drinking time, it is drinking time. It is the one thing i didn't get from the buenviajes, the want to drink. There are few times i don't mind drinking but let's just say they are very rare times. So we have a month left before ed leaves. I think it is starting to sink in with ed and with all of us. I think it sunk in with me a long time ago. I just hope that ed will be here for bailey's surgery. We have been keeping an eye on his swelling and there definitely is quite a bit of swelling."
"Saturday we took connor to firemans park, thinking that the fireman's easter egg hunt was to start at 11am. It turned out it was on the friday. Thank goodness i brought a bag of eggs with me just incase. So connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning when he woke up he was so excited that the easter bunny had come. There is nothing better then to see the excitement on your childs face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the 'easter bunny' is fun and all. We do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was megan's first easter, she looked so cute dressed in her jean dress and stockings :)"
"Friday november 22, 2002 woohoo, my boots are at the house! i forgot and had them delivered to my house instead of work so i have to wait another 4 hours to get them. Argh! these are the face boots, and tredair flame boots. I rock! i somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily i'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air. If not, they're going to change my tire and slap the spare on it. Thankfully my spare is full sized. I may get to buy a new tire tonight, woohoo! hamad tire here i come! i thought i had found another vw."
"I know in a previous post i protected parents, almost even taking their side, well here's my little change of mind. Parents don't know anything. They think they know you soooo well, maybe even to the point where they can read emotions off your face. They can't. Parents know nothing about us. And when i go upstairs after arguing with nicole about kelli, like i just did a few minutes ago, and they want me to tell them what's wrong. Yeah, how about you shut the fuck up!? i don't have to tell you what's wrong all the time. Here's the situation with nicole and kelli. Kelli and nicole don't like each other. At all."
"Music for the day: 94.7 fm &nbsp; almost didn't make it to work on time. There's some kinda huge accident at 14th and constitution that is making traffic hell in virginia. Thankfully i was able to skillyfully get my car from the far left lane to the far right, and was able to get my ass onto route 50. All of this, of course, means nothing to anyone unless you live around here...so nevermind. Basically i am happy to be sitting here as opposed to still sitting in my car. Yesterday sara decided to google me...and lo and behold, the email i wrote to ivan meisel on espn.com was published online! i had no idea; i thought it wasn't the most well-written argument but i guess someone thought otherwise."

"> what can i say... Harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was bloody brillant!! i went to see it right after school on friday. Yes, that's right i saw it on the opening day!! (thanks mike for the ticket) daniel radcliffe aka harry potter had grown up soo fast and he is sooo cute!! malofy too haha. Okay well... The movie was all the great i give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important details!! overall, the movie was good... I didn't really dress up to get the movie but i was wearing a ravenclaw tie even though, i like gryffindors better. I might go see the movie again like in 2 more weeks."
"Pears and peanut butter attempt #2. I have hard pears this time, and my own jar of peanut butter which i can dip the pears into, but it is still crunchy peanut butter not smooth and i definitely think it makes a difference. I am also slightly perturbed as i thought this was a healthy snack and have just noticed that per 5th of a jar (and our jars are way smaller) as in per 100g there are 614 calories!!!!!!!!!! don't think about it. Have just got back from an evening out at my old music teacher/friend's house. Yes i know... I missed er for that- but i did tape it! have also discovered that they are showing repeats of series 9 every morning at 9:55! was good seeing my friend, strange but good."
"Urllink some people are jumping to connect urllink this dot : the urllink organization for security and cooperation in europe was invited to monitor the election by the state department. The observers will come from the osce's office for democratic institutions and human rights. It will be the first time such a team has been present for a u.s. Presidential election. With urllink this dot : a baker's dozen of congressional democrats, among them four new yorkers, has petitioned u.n. Secretary- general kofi annan to dispatch international observers to florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree. Based on the info available, the osce seems to be coming here to learn from the u.s. Election process, not to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for u.n."
"My heinous mood has passed. Forthcoming period + forgetting to take prozac until late in the day = very sad, prone to tears kristin. But surprise of boyfriend at my doorstep + ice cream sundae + holding boyfriend's hand after i had a terribly scary dream in which people started shooting machine guns at the news bureau = kristin feeling better. And i don't have to work this morning la la la la la but i do have to call a man at kmiz to get his rate card. And tonight i get to see two of my best girls, amy and kate (hopefully with time to study in between). And tomorrow maybe i will see someone i haven't seen for quite awhile for our ww date."
"So, a lot has been going on with me... So, debbie like fought with me over what china i was allowed to use. I mean come on do you pull out enough expensive china to feed a ientire frickin' black bapist choir! so, anyways she had dishes galore! saucers, tea pots, coffee cups, wine goblets, water glasses, 7 different types of forks and spoons, dinner plates, salad plate, dessert plate, soup bowl, side bowl... I was like omfg! and, then she yells at me for eating appetizers as the turkey was cooking! i was like i will eat trust me, grarrg! so, then to the hospital with my father."
"Gop gets scolded on recruitment naturalization ceremonies in jacksonville are to be relocated after complaints that gop activists registered new citizens as republicans. By gary fineout and alfonso chardy the citizenship ceremony in jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop. All of it was suspicious to linda cross, who was there to watch her husband, dario cruz, take his citizenship oath."
"Hi all, one good news in store for you. I am taking up the role of pl for my project from coming monday. My present pl is going to onsite day after tomorrow, that's y.

"So its not really hooky, but i've been accumulating sub-days and decided to cash one in today, wednesday the 10th in japan (the post-time gives the u.s. Date, so its technically not correct), so i can just goof-off for a couple of days. Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get ones creative energy back. I have it good for a forgeiner, and my timing was good, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall in my lap. I know i am getting ripped off, though. I'm not blind to that fact. Getting hungry. Might go get some mexican food at speak easy, the 'american style' diner just across the street from the post office in my little prefecture."
I have always prided myself in making anyone that frequents casa pescatore as comforable as possible. I want them to make sure they feel at home as they will feel in their prospective residence. Yesterday- i hope i succeeded. The masses all congregated on perry ave with what many consider ' extreme prejudice'. 4:30pm was the time my best friend eric and his son nunu came over with a huge pan of baked ziti. The tables were set and i had all the food that i cooked and the bells were ringing crazy. Before i could blink - my best friend from florida walked through the door and that made me smile. I missed that motherfucker so much. The bonus was him bringing his wife along. She is expecting and this is the closest i could get to being an uncle. I spoiled that girl with tray after tray of food and tiramisu.
"I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch. As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."
"Prom is tomorrow.... I hope it is goona be fun.. That is all i ask. Rob gets here may 14th..... Yeah 3 weeks today.... Oh god i think i am giving myself an ulcer thinking about it. But i am so excited to see him, scared to yes, but tres excited. Leafs played last night.... But becuase calgary was playing at the same time and i am out on the west coast.... I had to watch the calgary game, not the leaf game.... Which is alright i guess.. Considering my leafs lost.. And that makes me sad. But philly is a good team.. So... I still have bragging rights.. They made it farther then the damn canucks! today is a crazy day..."
"Ok, so i have yet to see what my blog will actually look like. But apparently, this is the place to start. I am not quite sure what will be happening here; whether i will take to it and whatnot, but since i spend so much of my time in front of a machine, i might as well make proper use of my time and post all these bits of craziness that whiz around, nay stumble around more like, in my head. I was insipired by a blogger (who i never met in person), who managed to keep us up to date in the most intimate fashion about her day to day existance, and somewhat entertained at the same time..."
"1. Everyone is obsessed with one movie or series of movies, what's yours? evil dead series.. If it wasn't obvious. (i have one of the largest 'stuff from that movie series' collections ever) 2. Can you play an instrument? what is it? bass guitar, oh yes, i rock out. 3. Biggest money wasting vice? either my compulsive buying of dvds or any new technology. 4. Have any phobias, allergies, or compulsive behaviors? no, no, and i must bank-face all moneys in my wallet in order from least to greatest at all times. 5. How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? because i said so."
"Holla so i saw troy tonight with my family...i was not impressed. I'm too tired to go way into specifics, but i do think it had potential. However, i think too much energy was spent on the set (which was magnificent) and not enough on creating a solidifying tone, theme, etc. It retold the story, but it was not particularly gripping, and i don't feel like i gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, i thought the score was poor, and was basically a knock-off of the gladiator. The gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman and it worked b/c it backed up and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."
"Urllink lets all give a big hello to the newest atom/rdf/rss reader on the block, urllink pulpfiction 1.0 from urllink freshly squeezed software . It looks like it has a lot of native app goodness. It should be noted that it is not free or free, since that seems to be a 'hot topic' on the interweb again. You can try it for 15 days and then go back to something else, or pony up $25 if you like it. A feature that jumps out at me right away is how each post is its own entity, and can be moved around, stored, labeled, and even deleted. I could easily see how this would make some news tracker type people very happy. It imports and exports opml, as you might expect."
"Today... I miss my sister terribly - it just seems strange not to have her hanging around, irritating me (just joking...). Even though it was only for a week, she really made her presence felt, and i mean that in a good way. Just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently - last week in fact. Maybe it's just the thought that i won't see her for quite a while - with her going to bristol in sept/oct and all. She represented, on a deeper level, a link to my family back home. Oh how i miss them all. Tomorrow is the start of a new term. How did the holidays fly by so quickly?"
"Ever have one of those days when you just don't know what the... What the... Anything? no? well then you should skip the rest of this because it won't make any sense to you. To those of you choosing to continue on i offer the following observation. ' sometimes i wish i'd been given the manual .' manuals, if done correctly at least, let you know: what things are for, what they can do, how they do the things they do, what happens if you push button x or y, what to do if things aren't doing what they're supposed to the phone number and email address of the omniscient guru who can solve every problem very useful information. Unfortunately i didn't get a manual with me."
"And there's nothing wrong with pcs -- if i were a full-bore gamer with time to do such a thing, i'd certainly have a pc system for the wealth of available games. Though except for a few unique products, that huge wall of games at compusa starts getting repetetive after a while -- at first i'm envious, then i start noticing that it's really just a lot of different flavors of the same soda...first-person shooters, mystery games, strategy games, simulations. There are so many variations of age of empires it becomes comical. Aoe -- with orcs! aoe -- with spaceships! aoe -- with fuzzy wombats! it's like the endless movie trailers that begin with the line: 'in a world...'"
"Another week just flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, i am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from wednesday. I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better then i expected. Then we watched gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
"Summer tv tv in the summer used to be a dead zone full of repeats or something. But now there are two great new shows on tv and i have been watching both religiously for the last week. Blow out the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist jonothan antin wants build a second location to his incredibly popular west hollywood salon but this time in beverly hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not i, but as i was flipping thru the channels i caught a glipse of jonothan, equally narcissistic and dull looking at a empty space on rodeo dr speak (in a public voice) 'i am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and i was hooked. Not since rocco have i found such a moron compelling tv watching."
"What a week ... My right shoulder has tendonitus. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when i move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer .... It kills me. I can't move it much now because i was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely get up strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but i'll get better. My mom's surgery went ok. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon."
"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how very quickly the simplest things can become a freaking ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being sweet. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, i'm not surper sure i'll ever be bathing again so it's not like there was even an olefactory incentive there! i am doing two things right now. I am composing an post and i am also watching the collected no doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."
"So it is 11:14pm mst, and here i sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that i mind doing it, but i wonder sometimes at how often i find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to love and minister to people this way, but where is the line drawn where it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of? the last couple of weeks, i've been staying up late reading and such, so i was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until i realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* no rest for the weary, right? so i found myself watching joe schmo 2 again tonight."
"Remind me, what did i write about before this? or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga so, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, i forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before pat shows up to lunch, dustin starts talking about what a nice guy pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding and realizing that we're talking more about finding dustin's best friend a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror and then silently asked myself: am i being pawned off to the other guy? is this what happens now?"
"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually.. I'd like each and every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day, and if they're not prepared to, i'd like very much that they'd hop the fuck back in bed, and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No i'm not the smartest motherfucker in the world... But i'm not talking about things that take a lot of brain power, so i think its fair to persecute the inanely stupid. Lets see if i can keep this particular rant to a few particular types, and we'll save some for another day, sound good? great."
"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Urllink robert rubin told npr's marketplace today that bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle income persons. Ah, robert rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? it'll come to you... 2. We can't give the republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
"'she's saying i'm on the run, i'm chasing guys for fun' ~the offspring umm haven't updated in awhile but not much to say.. Went to the cove to see supernothing, they were good as usual, got to chill with tiago :-).. Sat. Went to work and then out w/ joe and rach, met up with steve, tiago and tom.. Came home at like quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet.. Got there a little late but it's all good, i did my full on floor and didn't fall, second on floor and vault and third on beam, 29.45 all around which isn't bad bc my meets get better as the season goes on.."
"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? like you're sitting in math class bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? and you realize that you exist and you are in math class and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you-the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? i hate that. You know what else i hate? block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
"I think that monpoly has run it's course in my life and i vow to never lay my hands on that damn iron (not a hot one but the piece in the game) again. Tonight andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the farquin game, or maybe i let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well how ever the story goes it can't compare to this texas sized headache i have at the moment, i've taken some aleve and i must say that they are doing the trick, all i need now is some well deserved r&r your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive in"
"Well... Today's been a long day. We had to drive home from indiana. I guess i'm gonna sort of have to be choosy what i write about because i could really take up a lot of time and space and i just don't have enough energy. First off i have to say that camp was awesome and even better than i could have expected. God's been doing so much stuff in my life lately and it's just awesome. I've sort of turned over a new leaf i guess, but anyway's back to the beginning. We arrived at the twiggs' house on friday evening and we stayed until we left for camp on monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, walmart and watched movies."
"Today is my last day of summer vacation! waaaaaa! and i have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but i'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think up for 'hell's no, me's don wanna go' to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, i love excelling at everything i do. But starting new things is a bitch. I hate being a pawn (like i told cassie: 'i'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and i hate not knowing what's going on."
"Arun shourie talks about how, the present governor of uttar pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a urllink ' third islamic state ' in the subcontinent . T v rajeswar, the former head of the intelligence bureau and the present governor of uttar pradesh had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the hindustan times, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he says, does the fact that you now know that he, and not i, to say nothing of mr advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? or do you conclude that because he wrote in this refrain, t v rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as governor of uttar pradesh?"
"Attitude: bored mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight been a long hard day in the trenches here today folks, almost no time to write anything for you readers. However it's good to see tigger(now akcron) taking up the reigns herself and making an appearance and talking about things :) not much to say about things, yesterday was shakespeare on the green, was a lovely play, but i had to leave before closing curtain, which kinda sucked, hopefully someday i'll see the entirety of a shakespeare play. But i digress. Akcron is right about the problems with the shower, it sucks, in terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self torture can be pretty entertaining."
"All of a sudden, for the past two days, i have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone dead exhaustion. Last evening, i went home, and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when i woke up, it was all dark, and i hadn't switched the lights on, so i could not figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why i'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when i came. Although in calcutta i hear it's been raining for the past three days."
"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater i was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time i got to the arm holes and the mohair was knotting itself together as i knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of sex and the city (way to go, library!). And then i got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose i could say i learned a lot while trying to do this sweater."
"Last night in class, we were discussing that week’s assigned reading, urllink getting back into place: toward a renewed study of the place-world, by edward s. Casey . The first chapter deals with “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” in the first chapter, casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He is trying to make the case that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community. (that is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) so far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."
"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? not i, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
"Currently listening to: the little drummer boy by stevan pasero ...and now my post... Senate republicans okay, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations wankathon last week? i know i didn't. Well, okay - i did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by republicans who, pissed off that democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of bush's nutjob justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind the fact that the democrats have already approved 168 of bush's judicial nominees - nooo, that's not good enough for the power-mad republicans who are for some reason laboring under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
"This was a good weekend. I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, i listened to a lot of nevermore (something i should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - bruce sterling's heavy weather, larry niven's world of ptavvs and octavia butler's parable of the sower. Heavy weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future usa, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, i must confess that i failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, i guess."
Coz' this is the aftermath the first week back from practicum was a struggle but it is only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken but with the eventual meeting with the course co-ordinator allowed me to release my burden and by doing so i have&nbsp;prevented another person being stuck with such a pedagogically deficit practicum school. Yesterday (monday) i bumped into another agrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it will be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first.
"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for supposed stress relieving activities. I've found that i really suck at 8-ball and ping pong! rick(the canuck) beats my ass on a regular basis - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a 'quick round'. Last night i participated in an 8-ball tournament over at the hot spot (our recreation tent - complete with popcorn machine, numerous tv's, jukebox, dvd rental, pool table, dart board, and ever present ping pong table). Anyway, i was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game - until i scratched on the eight ball ;( i still had a fairly good time - the most fun was the two dutch soldiers that joined in the tournament."
"Fall 1974: i was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then nor am i now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. So as i struggled to make sense out of algebra the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and just as i was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my sub conscious the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and once again no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."
"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent tuesday-thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, these are the things i need to consider as i spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had i known i was going to move prior to the end of my school year, i would have discarded much of the books and supplies i no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room. So she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"
"You can't help it, you can't evade it: a piece of you will always live in me. Even if i never carried you child, even if i was never married to you, even if i was never an official pair to you ... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will i always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach ... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever i get the feeling of a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me ... And still remains. .. For heri"
"I'm uncomfortable. Investigative reporting seems very wrong to me. Or let me rephrase that, the article i'm doing and it's consequences is not exactly something i'm comfortable with. Perhaps it is because i don't believe in it enough, that i cannot really get the complete feel for it. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that shit. They put you in jail with all these internal security acts. I am not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, i am not the easiest person to get along with."
"We had an outing yesterday with my co-employees at the bank. We went to guintubdan, la carolota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked for the falls. It was a 30 minute or so walk. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! but we made it. The water was chilly ice. You can feel your body getting numb because of the coldness. We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked calming and the whole scene is indeed breathtaking. Its like you can hear yourself being one with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with mother earth. The cold air and water were enough to make you be lulled to sleep."
"Well i am sure my sisters are drunk off their butts. Today was pride in san diego. I know my sisters and when it is drinking time, it is drinking time. It is the one thing i didn't get from the buenviajes, the want to drink. There are few times i don't mind drinking but let's just say they are very rare times. So we have a month left before ed leaves. I think it is starting to sink in with ed and with all of us. I think it sunk in with me a long time ago. I just hope that ed will be here for bailey's surgery. We have been keeping an eye on his swelling and there definitely is quite a bit of swelling."
"Saturday we took connor to firemans park, thinking that the fireman's easter egg hunt was to start at 11am. It turned out it was on the friday. Thank goodness i brought a bag of eggs with me just incase. So connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning when he woke up he was so excited that the easter bunny had come. There is nothing better then to see the excitement on your childs face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the 'easter bunny' is fun and all. We do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was megan's first easter, she looked so cute dressed in her jean dress and stockings :)"
"Friday november 22, 2002 woohoo, my boots are at the house! i forgot and had them delivered to my house instead of work so i have to wait another 4 hours to get them. Argh! these are the face boots, and tredair flame boots. I rock! i somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily i'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air. If not, they're going to change my tire and slap the spare on it. Thankfully my spare is full sized. I may get to buy a new tire tonight, woohoo! hamad tire here i come! i thought i had found another vw."
"I know in a previous post i protected parents, almost even taking their side, well here's my little change of mind. Parents don't know anything. They think they know you soooo well, maybe even to the point where they can read emotions off your face. They can't. Parents know nothing about us. And when i go upstairs after arguing with nicole about kelli, like i just did a few minutes ago, and they want me to tell them what's wrong. Yeah, how about you shut the fuck up!? i don't have to tell you what's wrong all the time. Here's the situation with nicole and kelli. Kelli and nicole don't like each other. At all."
"Music for the day: 94.7 fm &nbsp; almost didn't make it to work on time. There's some kinda huge accident at 14th and constitution that is making traffic hell in virginia. Thankfully i was able to skillyfully get my car from the far left lane to the far right, and was able to get my ass onto route 50. All of this, of course, means nothing to anyone unless you live around here...so nevermind. Basically i am happy to be sitting here as opposed to still sitting in my car. Yesterday sara decided to google me...and lo and behold, the email i wrote to ivan meisel on espn.com was published online! i had no idea; i thought it wasn't the most well-written argument but i guess someone thought otherwise."

"> what can i say... Harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was bloody brillant!! i went to see it right after school on friday. Yes, that's right i saw it on the opening day!! (thanks mike for the ticket) daniel radcliffe aka harry potter had grown up soo fast and he is sooo cute!! malofy too haha. Okay well... The movie was all the great i give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important details!! overall, the movie was good... I didn't really dress up to get the movie but i was wearing a ravenclaw tie even though, i like gryffindors better. I might go see the movie again like in 2 more weeks."
"Pears and peanut butter attempt #2. I have hard pears this time, and my own jar of peanut butter which i can dip the pears into, but it is still crunchy peanut butter not smooth and i definitely think it makes a difference. I am also slightly perturbed as i thought this was a healthy snack and have just noticed that per 5th of a jar (and our jars are way smaller) as in per 100g there are 614 calories!!!!!!!!!! don't think about it. Have just got back from an evening out at my old music teacher/friend's house. Yes i know... I missed er for that- but i did tape it! have also discovered that they are showing repeats of series 9 every morning at 9:55! was good seeing my friend, strange but good."
"Urllink some people are jumping to connect urllink this dot : the urllink organization for security and cooperation in europe was invited to monitor the election by the state department. The observers will come from the osce's office for democratic institutions and human rights. It will be the first time such a team has been present for a u.s. Presidential election. With urllink this dot : a baker's dozen of congressional democrats, among them four new yorkers, has petitioned u.n. Secretary- general kofi annan to dispatch international observers to florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree. Based on the info available, the osce seems to be coming here to learn from the u.s. Election process, not to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for u.n."
"My heinous mood has passed. Forthcoming period + forgetting to take prozac until late in the day = very sad, prone to tears kristin. But surprise of boyfriend at my doorstep + ice cream sundae + holding boyfriend's hand after i had a terribly scary dream in which people started shooting machine guns at the news bureau = kristin feeling better. And i don't have to work this morning la la la la la but i do have to call a man at kmiz to get his rate card. And tonight i get to see two of my best girls, amy and kate (hopefully with time to study in between). And tomorrow maybe i will see someone i haven't seen for quite awhile for our ww date."
"So, a lot has been going on with me... So, debbie like fought with me over what china i was allowed to use. I mean come on do you pull out enough expensive china to feed a ientire frickin' black bapist choir! so, anyways she had dishes galore! saucers, tea pots, coffee cups, wine goblets, water glasses, 7 different types of forks and spoons, dinner plates, salad plate, dessert plate, soup bowl, side bowl... I was like omfg! and, then she yells at me for eating appetizers as the turkey was cooking! i was like i will eat trust me, grarrg! so, then to the hospital with my father."
"Gop gets scolded on recruitment naturalization ceremonies in jacksonville are to be relocated after complaints that gop activists registered new citizens as republicans. By gary fineout and alfonso chardy the citizenship ceremony in jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop. All of it was suspicious to linda cross, who was there to watch her husband, dario cruz, take his citizenship oath."

"So its not really hooky, but i've been accumulating sub-days and decided to cash one in today, wednesday the 10th in japan (the post-time gives the u.s. Date, so its technically not correct), so i can just goof-off for a couple of days. Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get ones creative energy back. I have it good for a forgeiner, and my timing was good, too. The illustration part is the icing on the cake. I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall in my lap. I know i am getting ripped off, though. I'm not blind to that fact. Getting hungry. Might go get some mexican food at speak easy, the 'american style' diner just across the street from the post office in my little prefecture."
I have always prided myself in making anyone that frequents casa pescatore as comforable as possible. I want them to make sure they feel at home as they will feel in their prospective residence. Yesterday- i hope i succeeded. The masses all congregated on perry ave with what many consider ' extreme prejudice'. 4:30pm was the time my best friend eric and his son nunu came over with a huge pan of baked ziti. The tables were set and i had all the food that i cooked and the bells were ringing crazy. Before i could blink - my best friend from florida walked through the door and that made me smile. I missed that motherfucker so much. The bonus was him bringing his wife along. She is expecting and this is the closest i could get to being an uncle. I spoiled that girl with tray after tray of food and tiramisu.
"I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch. As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important."
"Prom is tomorrow.... I hope it is goona be fun.. That is all i ask. Rob gets here may 14th..... Yeah 3 weeks today.... Oh god i think i am giving myself an ulcer thinking about it. But i am so excited to see him, scared to yes, but tres excited. Leafs played last night.... But becuase calgary was playing at the same time and i am out on the west coast.... I had to watch the calgary game, not the leaf game.... Which is alright i guess.. Considering my leafs lost.. And that makes me sad. But philly is a good team.. So... I still have bragging rights.. They made it farther then the damn canucks! today is a crazy day..."
"Ok, so i have yet to see what my blog will actually look like. But apparently, this is the place to start. I am not quite sure what will be happening here; whether i will take to it and whatnot, but since i spend so much of my time in front of a machine, i might as well make proper use of my time and post all these bits of craziness that whiz around, nay stumble around more like, in my head. I was insipired by a blogger (who i never met in person), who managed to keep us up to date in the most intimate fashion about her day to day existance, and somewhat entertained at the same time..."
"1. Everyone is obsessed with one movie or series of movies, what's yours? evil dead series.. If it wasn't obvious. (i have one of the largest 'stuff from that movie series' collections ever) 2. Can you play an instrument? what is it? bass guitar, oh yes, i rock out. 3. Biggest money wasting vice? either my compulsive buying of dvds or any new technology. 4. Have any phobias, allergies, or compulsive behaviors? no, no, and i must bank-face all moneys in my wallet in order from least to greatest at all times. 5. How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? because i said so."
"Holla so i saw troy tonight with my family...i was not impressed. I'm too tired to go way into specifics, but i do think it had potential. However, i think too much energy was spent on the set (which was magnificent) and not enough on creating a solidifying tone, theme, etc. It retold the story, but it was not particularly gripping, and i don't feel like i gained anything from watching it. The character development was rather weak. Additionally, i thought the score was poor, and was basically a knock-off of the gladiator. The gladiator used the background music of a moaning woman and it worked b/c it backed up and complemented a genuinely gripping narrative."
"Urllink lets all give a big hello to the newest atom/rdf/rss reader on the block, urllink pulpfiction 1.0 from urllink freshly squeezed software . It looks like it has a lot of native app goodness. It should be noted that it is not free or free, since that seems to be a 'hot topic' on the interweb again. You can try it for 15 days and then go back to something else, or pony up $25 if you like it. A feature that jumps out at me right away is how each post is its own entity, and can be moved around, stored, labeled, and even deleted. I could easily see how this would make some news tracker type people very happy. It imports and exports opml, as you might expect."
"Today... I miss my sister terribly - it just seems strange not to have her hanging around, irritating me (just joking...). Even though it was only for a week, she really made her presence felt, and i mean that in a good way. Just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently - last week in fact. Maybe it's just the thought that i won't see her for quite a while - with her going to bristol in sept/oct and all. She represented, on a deeper level, a link to my family back home. Oh how i miss them all. Tomorrow is the start of a new term. How did the holidays fly by so quickly?"
"Ever have one of those days when you just don't know what the... What the... Anything? no? well then you should skip the rest of this because it won't make any sense to you. To those of you choosing to continue on i offer the following observation. ' sometimes i wish i'd been given the manual .' manuals, if done correctly at least, let you know: what things are for, what they can do, how they do the things they do, what happens if you push button x or y, what to do if things aren't doing what they're supposed to the phone number and email address of the omniscient guru who can solve every problem very useful information. Unfortunately i didn't get a manual with me."
"And there's nothing wrong with pcs -- if i were a full-bore gamer with time to do such a thing, i'd certainly have a pc system for the wealth of available games. Though except for a few unique products, that huge wall of games at compusa starts getting repetetive after a while -- at first i'm envious, then i start noticing that it's really just a lot of different flavors of the same soda...first-person shooters, mystery games, strategy games, simulations. There are so many variations of age of empires it becomes comical. Aoe -- with orcs! aoe -- with spaceships! aoe -- with fuzzy wombats! it's like the endless movie trailers that begin with the line: 'in a world...'"
"Another week just flew by me. I drove by the new house yesterday and the front window was covered in boxes. We may get the keys at closing, i am getting so excited. If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from wednesday. I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better then i expected. Then we watched gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
"Summer tv tv in the summer used to be a dead zone full of repeats or something. But now there are two great new shows on tv and i have been watching both religiously for the last week. Blow out the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist jonothan antin wants build a second location to his incredibly popular west hollywood salon but this time in beverly hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not i, but as i was flipping thru the channels i caught a glipse of jonothan, equally narcissistic and dull looking at a empty space on rodeo dr speak (in a public voice) 'i am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and i was hooked. Not since rocco have i found such a moron compelling tv watching."
"What a week ... My right shoulder has tendonitus. It's right under my shoulder blade. So, when i move my arm too much, mainly with a mouse on a computer .... It kills me. I can't move it much now because i was on a spree updating my website and working on other online things. I can barely get up strength to draw anything. Lack of sleep adds to my pain. I'm not too happy right now, but i'll get better. My mom's surgery went ok. Her eyesight has come back some. She can see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. Other than that she's still blind as all sin. Hopefully she'll fully regain her vision soon."
"Kindness of strangers... Attempted laundry today with the kids in tow and realized how very quickly the simplest things can become a freaking ordeal. I also learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being sweet. Trust me. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit... Also, i'm not surper sure i'll ever be bathing again so it's not like there was even an olefactory incentive there! i am doing two things right now. I am composing an post and i am also watching the collected no doubt videos. I am doing both of these things sitting at my desk in my room."
"So it is 11:14pm mst, and here i sit in my bedroom fixing the personal computer of the personnel director from my job. Not that i mind doing it, but i wonder sometimes at how often i find myself fixing someone else's computer as a favour. I'm glad to be able to love and minister to people this way, but where is the line drawn where it comes to the point that you are being taken advantage of? the last couple of weeks, i've been staying up late reading and such, so i was looking forward to hitting the sack early, until i realized it would be more prudent to get this computer out of my bedroom and back into its owner's hands. *laugh* no rest for the weary, right? so i found myself watching joe schmo 2 again tonight."
"Remind me, what did i write about before this? or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga so, after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, i forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. Before pat shows up to lunch, dustin starts talking about what a nice guy pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding and realizing that we're talking more about finding dustin's best friend a girl, than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade. I excused myself to the bathroom, looked in the mirror and then silently asked myself: am i being pawned off to the other guy? is this what happens now?"
"I would like everyone to think before they act. Actually.. I'd like each and every single person in the world to think before they get out of bed in the morning, and make a commitment to keep thinking all day, and if they're not prepared to, i'd like very much that they'd hop the fuck back in bed, and drift off to an eternal slumber. I'm sick to death of stupid people. No i'm not the smartest motherfucker in the world... But i'm not talking about things that take a lot of brain power, so i think its fair to persecute the inanely stupid. Lets see if i can keep this particular rant to a few particular types, and we'll save some for another day, sound good? great."
"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post: 1. True, bush is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. Urllink robert rubin told npr's marketplace today that bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle income persons. Ah, robert rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? it'll come to you... 2. We can't give the republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
"'she's saying i'm on the run, i'm chasing guys for fun' ~the offspring umm haven't updated in awhile but not much to say.. Went to the cove to see supernothing, they were good as usual, got to chill with tiago :-).. Sat. Went to work and then out w/ joe and rach, met up with steve, tiago and tom.. Came home at like quarter to 12 and woke up the next morning at quarter to 7 for a meet.. Got there a little late but it's all good, i did my full on floor and didn't fall, second on floor and vault and third on beam, 29.45 all around which isn't bad bc my meets get better as the season goes on.."
"Do you ever have one of those moments when you begin to reflect on life? like you're sitting in math class bored out of your skull, and you wonder what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? and you realize that you exist and you are in math class and you wonder why. Then you realize how amazing existing is. And suddenly it hits you-the fact that you are going off on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? i hate that. You know what else i hate? block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? anyone can see that sitting through a two and a half hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
"I think that monpoly has run it's course in my life and i vow to never lay my hands on that damn iron (not a hot one but the piece in the game) again. Tonight andy beat me by a few small dollars and won the farquin game, or maybe i let him win on account of him leaving in a few short hours and me wanting him to feel good on his last night here. Well how ever the story goes it can't compare to this texas sized headache i have at the moment, i've taken some aleve and i must say that they are doing the trick, all i need now is some well deserved r&r your telephone's the one that helped me wrap the cord around your neck... At the drive in"
"Well... Today's been a long day. We had to drive home from indiana. I guess i'm gonna sort of have to be choosy what i write about because i could really take up a lot of time and space and i just don't have enough energy. First off i have to say that camp was awesome and even better than i could have expected. God's been doing so much stuff in my life lately and it's just awesome. I've sort of turned over a new leaf i guess, but anyway's back to the beginning. We arrived at the twiggs' house on friday evening and we stayed until we left for camp on monday. Most of what we did was go to the fair, church, a parade, walmart and watched movies."
"Today is my last day of summer vacation! waaaaaa! and i have a dentist appointment at 9. I hate that, but i'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think up for 'hell's no, me's don wanna go' to school. This is going to be a whole new ball game for me. As a perfectionist, i love excelling at everything i do. But starting new things is a bitch. I hate being a pawn (like i told cassie: 'i'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight'), and i hate not knowing what's going on."
"Arun shourie talks about how, the present governor of uttar pradesh had warned, as far back as 1996, about the impending threat of the rise of a urllink ' third islamic state ' in the subcontinent . T v rajeswar, the former head of the intelligence bureau and the present governor of uttar pradesh had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the hindustan times, way back in 1996. Shourie raises a valid point when he says, does the fact that you now know that he, and not i, to say nothing of mr advani, wrote all that make the warnings ring true? or do you conclude that because he wrote in this refrain, t v rajeswar is a closet communalist and should not be allowed to continue as governor of uttar pradesh?"
"Attitude: bored mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight been a long hard day in the trenches here today folks, almost no time to write anything for you readers. However it's good to see tigger(now akcron) taking up the reigns herself and making an appearance and talking about things :) not much to say about things, yesterday was shakespeare on the green, was a lovely play, but i had to leave before closing curtain, which kinda sucked, hopefully someday i'll see the entirety of a shakespeare play. But i digress. Akcron is right about the problems with the shower, it sucks, in terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self torture can be pretty entertaining."
"All of a sudden, for the past two days, i have been overcome with terrible bouts of exhaustion. Bone dead exhaustion. Last evening, i went home, and just slept off, and only got up when my mother called me around eight thirty. And when i woke up, it was all dark, and i hadn't switched the lights on, so i could not figure out what time or date it was, for a few seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me grappling with reality. Wonder why i'm feeling so drained... Nice weather this morning. It was drizzling when i came. Although in calcutta i hear it's been raining for the past three days."
"Last night was the worst. I threw away the sweater i was knitting. I only had about 14 inches. I lost probably $10 worth of yarn (it's $8 a skein). But it had too many stitches by the time i got to the arm holes and the mohair was knotting itself together as i knitted, so frogging (ripping out rows) didn't work well. The yarn broke a lot. I didn't even swear, which is unusual for me. I just morosely ripped and listened to season two of sex and the city (way to go, library!). And then i got sick of it and threw it away. I suppose i could say i learned a lot while trying to do this sweater."
"Last night in class, we were discussing that week’s assigned reading, urllink getting back into place: toward a renewed study of the place-world, by edward s. Casey . The first chapter deals with “implacement” and the second, “displacement.” in the first chapter, casey makes the distinction that our contemporary world and culture revolves around time as the situating force: we are running out of time, we have saved time, we are just in time. He is trying to make the case that using place as the center of culture gives a more grounded community. (that is a very rough summation, a disclaimer just in case my professor or any other classmate happens to read this post.) so far, this book is the first reading that has grabbed me by the proverbial shoulders."
"Whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. And whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. Lucky we did. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? not i, for certain. I list but a few: buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
"Currently listening to: the little drummer boy by stevan pasero ...and now my post... Senate republicans okay, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations wankathon last week? i know i didn't. Well, okay - i did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by republicans who, pissed off that democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of bush's nutjob justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day cry-fest. Never mind the fact that the democrats have already approved 168 of bush's judicial nominees - nooo, that's not good enough for the power-mad republicans who are for some reason laboring under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
"This was a good weekend. I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, i listened to a lot of nevermore (something i should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - bruce sterling's heavy weather, larry niven's world of ptavvs and octavia butler's parable of the sower. Heavy weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future usa, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, i must confess that i failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, i guess."
Coz' this is the aftermath the first week back from practicum was a struggle but it is only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma was a hidden epidemic that is only now coming to light. I was stricken but with the eventual meeting with the course co-ordinator allowed me to release my burden and by doing so i have&nbsp;prevented another person being stuck with such a pedagogically deficit practicum school. Yesterday (monday) i bumped into another agrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it will be. I calmed her down and said that we should go to the administrator first.
"Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for supposed stress relieving activities. I've found that i really suck at 8-ball and ping pong! rick(the canuck) beats my ass on a regular basis - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a 'quick round'. Last night i participated in an 8-ball tournament over at the hot spot (our recreation tent - complete with popcorn machine, numerous tv's, jukebox, dvd rental, pool table, dart board, and ever present ping pong table). Anyway, i was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game - until i scratched on the eight ball ;( i still had a fairly good time - the most fun was the two dutch soldiers that joined in the tournament."
"Fall 1974: i was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. I was not then nor am i now a math person. I hate math. I am math phobic. You get the picture. So as i struggled to make sense out of algebra the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door. No one was there. Great. I returned to my studies and just as i was finding a little glimmer of understanding buried in my sub conscious the doorbell rang again. Bam, just like that my breakthrough disappeared. I went to the door and once again no one was there. Just what a struggling math student needs, an uninvited practical joker."
"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent tuesday-thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade level team, these are the things i need to consider as i spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had i known i was going to move prior to the end of my school year, i would have discarded much of the books and supplies i no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate jill for helping with all of this. You see, she was still teaching this month, in my old room. So she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"
"You can't help it, you can't evade it: a piece of you will always live in me. Even if i never carried you child, even if i was never married to you, even if i was never an official pair to you ... I loved you immensely, and to this day the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will i always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach ... Or a kiss under the rain. Whenever i get the feeling of a dark glass puncturing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... Bleeding the eternal love that once lived in me ... And still remains. .. For heri"
"I'm uncomfortable. Investigative reporting seems very wrong to me. Or let me rephrase that, the article i'm doing and it's consequences is not exactly something i'm comfortable with. Perhaps it is because i don't believe in it enough, that i cannot really get the complete feel for it. The angst behind it. The full-out passion towards it to question. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. Really, you just don't. They shoot you for that shit. They put you in jail with all these internal security acts. I am not used to this freedom of speech...not used to questioning out loud. Sure, i am not the easiest person to get along with."
"We had an outing yesterday with my co-employees at the bank. We went to guintubdan, la carolota. It was the first time for most of us. We trekked for the falls. It was a 30 minute or so walk. We were all catching our breaths. Whew! but we made it. The water was chilly ice. You can feel your body getting numb because of the coldness. We only stayed less than an hour because we headed for the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking. But the trip was worth it because the falls looked calming and the whole scene is indeed breathtaking. Its like you can hear yourself being one with nature. Soaking myself in the cold water was like communing with mother earth. The cold air and water were enough to make you be lulled to sleep."
"Well i am sure my sisters are drunk off their butts. Today was pride in san diego. I know my sisters and when it is drinking time, it is drinking time. It is the one thing i didn't get from the buenviajes, the want to drink. There are few times i don't mind drinking but let's just say they are very rare times. So we have a month left before ed leaves. I think it is starting to sink in with ed and with all of us. I think it sunk in with me a long time ago. I just hope that ed will be here for bailey's surgery. We have been keeping an eye on his swelling and there definitely is quite a bit of swelling."
"Saturday we took connor to firemans park, thinking that the fireman's easter egg hunt was to start at 11am. It turned out it was on the friday. Thank goodness i brought a bag of eggs with me just incase. So connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning when he woke up he was so excited that the easter bunny had come. There is nothing better then to see the excitement on your childs face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the 'easter bunny' is fun and all. We do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was megan's first easter, she looked so cute dressed in her jean dress and stockings :)"
"Friday november 22, 2002 woohoo, my boots are at the house! i forgot and had them delivered to my house instead of work so i have to wait another 4 hours to get them. Argh! these are the face boots, and tredair flame boots. I rock! i somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily i'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air. If not, they're going to change my tire and slap the spare on it. Thankfully my spare is full sized. I may get to buy a new tire tonight, woohoo! hamad tire here i come! i thought i had found another vw."
"I know in a previous post i protected parents, almost even taking their side, well here's my little change of mind. Parents don't know anything. They think they know you soooo well, maybe even to the point where they can read emotions off your face. They can't. Parents know nothing about us. And when i go upstairs after arguing with nicole about kelli, like i just did a few minutes ago, and they want me to tell them what's wrong. Yeah, how about you shut the fuck up!? i don't have to tell you what's wrong all the time. Here's the situation with nicole and kelli. Kelli and nicole don't like each other. At all."
"Music for the day: 94.7 fm &nbsp; almost didn't make it to work on time. There's some kinda huge accident at 14th and constitution that is making traffic hell in virginia. Thankfully i was able to skillyfully get my car from the far left lane to the far right, and was able to get my ass onto route 50. All of this, of course, means nothing to anyone unless you live around here...so nevermind. Basically i am happy to be sitting here as opposed to still sitting in my car. Yesterday sara decided to google me...and lo and behold, the email i wrote to ivan meisel on espn.com was published online! i had no idea; i thought it wasn't the most well-written argument but i guess someone thought otherwise."

"> what can i say... Harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was bloody brillant!! i went to see it right after school on friday. Yes, that's right i saw it on the opening day!! (thanks mike for the ticket) daniel radcliffe aka harry potter had grown up soo fast and he is sooo cute!! malofy too haha. Okay well... The movie was all the great i give it 4 1/2 stars because they left out important details!! overall, the movie was good... I didn't really dress up to get the movie but i was wearing a ravenclaw tie even though, i like gryffindors better. I might go see the movie again like in 2 more weeks."
"Pears and peanut butter attempt #2. I have hard pears this time, and my own jar of peanut butter which i can dip the pears into, but it is still crunchy peanut butter not smooth and i definitely think it makes a difference. I am also slightly perturbed as i thought this was a healthy snack and have just noticed that per 5th of a jar (and our jars are way smaller) as in per 100g there are 614 calories!!!!!!!!!! don't think about it. Have just got back from an evening out at my old music teacher/friend's house. Yes i know... I missed er for that- but i did tape it! have also discovered that they are showing repeats of series 9 every morning at 9:55! was good seeing my friend, strange but good."
"Urllink some people are jumping to connect urllink this dot : the urllink organization for security and cooperation in europe was invited to monitor the election by the state department. The observers will come from the osce's office for democratic institutions and human rights. It will be the first time such a team has been present for a u.s. Presidential election. With urllink this dot : a baker's dozen of congressional democrats, among them four new yorkers, has petitioned u.n. Secretary- general kofi annan to dispatch international observers to florida to oversee this year's presidential balloting there. I humbly disagree. Based on the info available, the osce seems to be coming here to learn from the u.s. Election process, not to oversee it, which was the original partisan and childish call for u.n."
"My heinous mood has passed. Forthcoming period + forgetting to take prozac until late in the day = very sad, prone to tears kristin. But surprise of boyfriend at my doorstep + ice cream sundae + holding boyfriend's hand after i had a terribly scary dream in which people started shooting machine guns at the news bureau = kristin feeling better. And i don't have to work this morning la la la la la but i do have to call a man at kmiz to get his rate card. And tonight i get to see two of my best girls, amy and kate (hopefully with time to study in between). And tomorrow maybe i will see someone i haven't seen for quite awhile for our ww date."

"Gop gets scolded on recruitment naturalization ceremonies in jacksonville are to be relocated after complaints that gop activists registered new citizens as republicans. By gary fineout and alfonso chardy the citizenship ceremony in jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop. All of it was suspicious to linda cross, who was there to watch her husband, dario cruz, take his citizenship oath."
