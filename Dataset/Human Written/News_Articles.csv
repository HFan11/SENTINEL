"World leaders gather to face uncertainty more than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). For five days, they will discuss issues ranging from china's economic power to iraq's future after this sunday's elections. Uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the wef are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. The brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum, timed to run in parallel with the wef's ritzier event in davos."
"Deadline nears for fiat-gm deal fiat and general motors (gm) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover. The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat."
"Cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty, cardinal cormac murphy-o'connor has said. The head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass. The cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a ""terrible"" waste of money. He and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war. Speaking on bbc radio 4's thought for the day slot, he criticised the fact that ""billions"" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people ""out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease"". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to ""make history poverty""."
"British stars denied major oscars british hopes of winning major oscars were dashed as uk stars failed to win acting and directing prizes. Despite three nominations, mike leigh's vera drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star imelda staunton. Kate winslet also lost to best actress hilary swank, while clive owen and sophie okonedo failed to win best supporting actor awards. The uk's andrea arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama wasp. Arnold, who presented children's television shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s, said it was ""totally overwhelming"" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow uk nominees gary mckendry and ashvin kumar."
"Halloween writer debra hill dies screenwriter and producer debra hill, best known for her work on the 70s horror classic halloween, has died in los angeles aged 54. Hill, who had been suffering from cancer, co-wrote the 1978 film, which starred jamie lee curtis as a babysitter terrorised by a psychopath. Directed by john carpenter, it made over $60m (£31.3m) worldwide - a record for independent film at that time. Hill also worked with carpenter on escape from new york and the fog. Born in new jersey, hill began her career as a production assistant and worked her way through the ranks, becoming an assistant director and second-unit director before she began collaborating with carpenter. She was regarded by many as a pioneering woman in film, taking on jobs in the 70s that were more commonly taken by men."
"Broadband fuels online expression fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests. A quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by uk think-tank demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. The demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online."
"Yukos heading back to us courts russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival. The firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (£14bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted. Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means."
"Voters flock to blog awards site voting is under way for the annual bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year. Nominations were announced on sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors. Weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories, from the top regional blog, to the best-kept-secret blog. Blogs had a huge year, with a top us dictionary naming ""blog"" word of 2004. Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to us research think-tank pew internet and american life, but less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months."
"Chinese dam firm 'defies beijing' the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the chinese state press has said. The builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam, said the beijing news. The xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant. So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china's state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order."
"Man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city. Wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. Seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. Steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar."
"Wales 'must learn health lessons' the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. Dr brian gibbons, on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked, admitted ""big challenges"" but insisted the ""essentials"" were in place. But both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile ms hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda. Dr gibbons, who was a gp in blaengwynfi, in the upper afan valley, before becoming am for aberavon, said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". One of the biggest problems which had faced ms hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in wales."

"Downloads enter us singles chart digital music downloads are being included in the main us singles chart for the first time. Billboard's hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart. Green day's boulevard of broken dreams is currently number two in billboard's pop chart, and tops its digital chart. Download sales are due to be incorporated into the uk singles chart later this year. Digital sales in the us are already used to compile billboard's hot digital sales chart. They will now be tallied with sales of physical singles and airplay information to make up its new hot 100 chart. Its second new chart - the pop 100 - also combines airplay, digital and physical sales but confines its airplay information to us radio stations which play chart music."
"Anti-spam laws bite spammer hard the net's self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection. Scott richter, the man behind optinrealbig.com and billions of junk mail messages, said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11. Optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. The company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading. Listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus, optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws. The lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries."
"Arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane. There had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen's role at the club. ""it is absolutely not true,"" arnesen told bbc radio five live. ""there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems. ""he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself."" arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. He added: ""jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But i trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it."

Hugo southwell's try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o'gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, eddie o'sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points."
"Economy focus for election battle britain's economic future will be at the heart of labour's poll campaign, chancellor gordon brown has said. He was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. He said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. Meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle ""yob culture"" and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. Earlier the archbishop of canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears. In an open letter, he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism, asylum, and crime."
Brizzel to run aaa's in sheffield ballymena sprinter paul brizzel will be among eight of ireland's european indoor hopefuls competing in this weekend's aaa's championships.

And at 1815 gmt, great britain's rugby league team take on australia in the final of the tri-nations tournament. ""beating the aussies in both games would be a massive achievement, especially for league,"" said robinson. England have the chance to seal their third autumn international victory after successive wins over canada and south africa, as well as gaining revenge for june's 51-15 hammering by the wallabies. Meanwhile, great britain could end 34 years of failure against australia with victory at elland road."
"Warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. However, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads ""urgent tsunami earthquake appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts."
"Iraq to invite phone licence bids iraq is to invite bids for two telephone licences, saying it wants to significantly boost nationwide coverage over the next decade. Bids have been invited from local, arab and foreign companies, iraq's ministry of communications said. The winner will work in partnership with the iraqi telecommunications and post company (itpc).

Details of the bidding and tender process will be published on the ministry's website on 9 february. It also is planning a road-show for investors in amman, jordan."
"More women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. The number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers."
"Podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. Podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free."

"Yukos seeks court action on sale yukos will return to a us court on wednesday to seek sanctions against baikal finance group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset. Yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear. Russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas, russia's fourth-biggest oil producer."

Lee miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over colin meldrum and into the net from a jamie mcallister free kick. Mcallister himself scored the second when he met saul mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. Craig easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but hearts held on. The opening goal came after gus bahoken had clumsily fouled miller 35 yards from goal.

"Sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. Sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. ""why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california."

Cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. She praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. Ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. Last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue."

"Home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. Research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the uk, germany, us and south korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. The nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends. In the uk 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile."

Mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. Mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. Tony blair has argued. There needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto.

"Us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. The unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. Hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty."

Responding to the plans, the chairman of the police federation of england and wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained. Jan berry said: ""it is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. ""these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,"" she warned."
"At a glance: tory health checks the uk' opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. Here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical. Tuberculosis, hepatitis b and hiv. A positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis."
"Paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday's epic in paris? and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978? those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris. Welsh legend mervyn davies, a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as ""one of the great performances of the past three decades"". Martyn williams, wales' two-try scorer on the day, called it ""one of the most surreal games i have ever played in"". A crestfallen france coach, bernard laporte, simply observed: ""there was a french half and there was a welsh half""."
"Doves soar to uk album summit manchester rock band doves have entered the uk album chart at number one with their new release, some cities. The trio replace flamboyant us act scissor sisters at the top. The album follows single black and white town, which reached number six. R&b star nelly has the new number one single with over and over, which sees him team up with tim mcgraw. Girls aloud, akon and kaiser chiefs all have new singles in the top ten, as do futureheads and usher.

Hip-hop performer akon's locked up is at number five, while hotly-tipped leeds band kaiser chiefs have their second chart hit at number six with oh my god."
"Davies favours gloucester future wales hooker mefin davies is likely to stay with english side gloucester despite reported interest from the neath-swansea ospreys. Bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is. Davies, one of the stars of saturday's rbs six nations win over england, is only on a year contract at kingsholm. But the hooker has proved his worth to the zurich premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. The summer demise of the celtic warriors region left davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with neath rfc. Although he got match time with the ospreys at the request of the wales management, he admitted before his move to gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated."
"Cabinet anger at brown cash raid ministers are unhappy about plans to use whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down, local government minister nick raynsford has acknowledged. Gordon brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-budget report on thursday. Mr raynsford said he had held some ""pretty frank discussions"" with fellow ministers over the plans. But he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises. The central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in england keep next year's council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year. Mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities."

The club have a strong ethic and are high profile promoters of peace and co-operation within israel."
"New drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says. University college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 department of transport document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year."
"World leaders gather to face uncertainty more than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). For five days, they will discuss issues ranging from china's economic power to iraq's future after this sunday's elections. Uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the wef are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. The brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum, timed to run in parallel with the wef's ritzier event in davos."
"Deadline nears for fiat-gm deal fiat and general motors (gm) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover. The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat."
"Cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty, cardinal cormac murphy-o'connor has said. The head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass. The cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a ""terrible"" waste of money. He and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war. Speaking on bbc radio 4's thought for the day slot, he criticised the fact that ""billions"" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people ""out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease"". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to ""make history poverty""."
"British stars denied major oscars british hopes of winning major oscars were dashed as uk stars failed to win acting and directing prizes. Despite three nominations, mike leigh's vera drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star imelda staunton. Kate winslet also lost to best actress hilary swank, while clive owen and sophie okonedo failed to win best supporting actor awards. The uk's andrea arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama wasp. Arnold, who presented children's television shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s, said it was ""totally overwhelming"" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow uk nominees gary mckendry and ashvin kumar."
"Halloween writer debra hill dies screenwriter and producer debra hill, best known for her work on the 70s horror classic halloween, has died in los angeles aged 54. Hill, who had been suffering from cancer, co-wrote the 1978 film, which starred jamie lee curtis as a babysitter terrorised by a psychopath. Directed by john carpenter, it made over $60m (£31.3m) worldwide - a record for independent film at that time. Hill also worked with carpenter on escape from new york and the fog. Born in new jersey, hill began her career as a production assistant and worked her way through the ranks, becoming an assistant director and second-unit director before she began collaborating with carpenter. She was regarded by many as a pioneering woman in film, taking on jobs in the 70s that were more commonly taken by men."
"Broadband fuels online expression fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests. A quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by uk think-tank demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. The demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online."
"Yukos heading back to us courts russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival. The firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (£14bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted. Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means."
"Voters flock to blog awards site voting is under way for the annual bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year. Nominations were announced on sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors.

"Chinese dam firm 'defies beijing' the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the chinese state press has said. The builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam, said the beijing news. The xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant. So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china's state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order."
"Man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city. Wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. Seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. Steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar."
"Wales 'must learn health lessons' the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. Dr brian gibbons, on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked, admitted ""big challenges"" but insisted the ""essentials"" were in place. But both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile ms hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda. Dr gibbons, who was a gp in blaengwynfi, in the upper afan valley, before becoming am for aberavon, said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". One of the biggest problems which had faced ms hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in wales."

Billboard's hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart. Green day's boulevard of broken dreams is currently number two in billboard's pop chart, and tops its digital chart.

"Anti-spam laws bite spammer hard the net's self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection. Scott richter, the man behind optinrealbig.com and billions of junk mail messages, said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11. Optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. The company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading. Listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus, optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws. The lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries."

There had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen's role at the club. ""it is absolutely not true,"" arnesen told bbc radio five live. ""there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems. ""he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself."" arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. He added: ""jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But i trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it."

Hugo southwell's try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o'gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, eddie o'sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points."
"Economy focus for election battle britain's economic future will be at the heart of labour's poll campaign, chancellor gordon brown has said. He was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. He said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. Meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle ""yob culture"" and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. Earlier the archbishop of canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears. In an open letter, he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism, asylum, and crime."

Meanwhile, great britain could end 34 years of failure against australia with victory at elland road."
"Warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. However, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads ""urgent tsunami earthquake appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts."

"More women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. The number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers."
"Podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. Podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free."

Lee miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over colin meldrum and into the net from a jamie mcallister free kick. Mcallister himself scored the second when he met saul mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors.

"Sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. Sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. ""why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california."
"Jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them ""where it hurts most"" by banning them from matches. Cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. She praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. Ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive.

"Home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. Research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the uk, germany, us and south korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. The nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends. In the uk 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile."

Mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. Mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. Tony blair has argued. There needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto.

"Us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. The unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. Hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.

The world's biggest retailer wal-mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers. The group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals, benefits package and promotion strategy. Meanwhile, drugs group eli lilly is planning a campaign against ""false"" claims about its product prozac. Wal-mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the wall street journal, using an open letter from company president lee scott saying it was time for the public to hear the ""unfiltered truth"".

"Tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the conservatives. Party leader michael howard said the new role would replace ""inconspicuous"" police authorities. He said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. The lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while labour criticised ""extravagant"" tory promises on policing. Responding to the plans, the chairman of the police federation of england and wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained. Jan berry said: ""it is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. ""these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,"" she warned."
"At a glance: tory health checks the uk' opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. Here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical. Tuberculosis, hepatitis b and hiv. A positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis."
"Paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday's epic in paris? and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978? those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris. Welsh legend mervyn davies, a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as ""one of the great performances of the past three decades"". Martyn williams, wales' two-try scorer on the day, called it ""one of the most surreal games i have ever played in"".

"Davies favours gloucester future wales hooker mefin davies is likely to stay with english side gloucester despite reported interest from the neath-swansea ospreys. Bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is. Davies, one of the stars of saturday's rbs six nations win over england, is only on a year contract at kingsholm. But the hooker has proved his worth to the zurich premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. The summer demise of the celtic warriors region left davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with neath rfc. Although he got match time with the ospreys at the request of the wales management, he admitted before his move to gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated."
"Cabinet anger at brown cash raid ministers are unhappy about plans to use whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down, local government minister nick raynsford has acknowledged. Gordon brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-budget report on thursday. Mr raynsford said he had held some ""pretty frank discussions"" with fellow ministers over the plans. But he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises. The central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in england keep next year's council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year. Mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities."

"New drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says. University college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 department of transport document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year."

"Deadline nears for fiat-gm deal fiat and general motors (gm) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover. The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat."
"Cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty, cardinal cormac murphy-o'connor has said. The head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass. The cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a ""terrible"" waste of money. He and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war. Speaking on bbc radio 4's thought for the day slot, he criticised the fact that ""billions"" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people ""out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease"". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to ""make history poverty""."
"British stars denied major oscars british hopes of winning major oscars were dashed as uk stars failed to win acting and directing prizes. Despite three nominations, mike leigh's vera drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star imelda staunton. Kate winslet also lost to best actress hilary swank, while clive owen and sophie okonedo failed to win best supporting actor awards. The uk's andrea arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama wasp. Arnold, who presented children's television shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s, said it was ""totally overwhelming"" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow uk nominees gary mckendry and ashvin kumar."
"Halloween writer debra hill dies screenwriter and producer debra hill, best known for her work on the 70s horror classic halloween, has died in los angeles aged 54. Hill, who had been suffering from cancer, co-wrote the 1978 film, which starred jamie lee curtis as a babysitter terrorised by a psychopath. Directed by john carpenter, it made over $60m (£31.3m) worldwide - a record for independent film at that time. Hill also worked with carpenter on escape from new york and the fog. Born in new jersey, hill began her career as a production assistant and worked her way through the ranks, becoming an assistant director and second-unit director before she began collaborating with carpenter. She was regarded by many as a pioneering woman in film, taking on jobs in the 70s that were more commonly taken by men."
"Broadband fuels online expression fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests. A quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by uk think-tank demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. The demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online."
"Yukos heading back to us courts russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival. The firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (£14bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted. Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means."
"Voters flock to blog awards site voting is under way for the annual bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year. Nominations were announced on sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors.

"Chinese dam firm 'defies beijing' the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the chinese state press has said. The builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam, said the beijing news. The xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant. So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china's state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order."
"Man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city. Wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. Seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. Steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar."
"Wales 'must learn health lessons' the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. Dr brian gibbons, on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked, admitted ""big challenges"" but insisted the ""essentials"" were in place. But both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile ms hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda. Dr gibbons, who was a gp in blaengwynfi, in the upper afan valley, before becoming am for aberavon, said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". One of the biggest problems which had faced ms hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in wales."

Billboard's hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart. Green day's boulevard of broken dreams is currently number two in billboard's pop chart, and tops its digital chart.

Scott richter, the man behind optinrealbig.com and billions of junk mail messages, said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11. Optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. The company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading. Listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus, optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws. The lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries."

There had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen's role at the club. ""it is absolutely not true,"" arnesen told bbc radio five live.

""he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself."" arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. He added: ""jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But i trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it."

Hugo southwell's try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o'gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, eddie o'sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points."
"Economy focus for election battle britain's economic future will be at the heart of labour's poll campaign, chancellor gordon brown has said. He was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. He said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. Meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle ""yob culture"" and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax.

Meanwhile, great britain could end 34 years of failure against australia with victory at elland road."
"Warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. However, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads ""urgent tsunami earthquake appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts."

The number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers."
"Podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. Podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free."

"Sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. Sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. ""why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california."
"Jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them ""where it hurts most"" by banning them from matches. Cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. She praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. Ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. Last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue."

"Home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. Research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the uk, germany, us and south korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. The nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends. In the uk 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile."
"Melzer shocks agassi second seed andre agassi suffered a comprehensive defeat by jurgen melzer in the quarter-finals of the sap open. Agassi was often bamboozled by the austrian's drop shots in san jose, losing 6-3 6-1. Defending champion and top seed andy roddick rallied to beat sweden's thomas enqvist 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-5.

Mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. Mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. Tony blair has argued. There needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto.

"Us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. The unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. Hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty."

The group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals, benefits package and promotion strategy.

Party leader michael howard said the new role would replace ""inconspicuous"" police authorities. He said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. The lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while labour criticised ""extravagant"" tory promises on policing. Responding to the plans, the chairman of the police federation of england and wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained. Jan berry said: ""it is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. ""these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,"" she warned."
"At a glance: tory health checks the uk' opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. Here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical. Tuberculosis, hepatitis b and hiv. A positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis."

"Davies favours gloucester future wales hooker mefin davies is likely to stay with english side gloucester despite reported interest from the neath-swansea ospreys. Bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is. Davies, one of the stars of saturday's rbs six nations win over england, is only on a year contract at kingsholm. But the hooker has proved his worth to the zurich premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. The summer demise of the celtic warriors region left davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with neath rfc. Although he got match time with the ospreys at the request of the wales management, he admitted before his move to gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated."

The central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in england keep next year's council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year. Mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities."

"New drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says. University college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 department of transport document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year."

"Deadline nears for fiat-gm deal fiat and general motors (gm) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover. The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat."
"Cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty, cardinal cormac murphy-o'connor has said. The head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass. The cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a ""terrible"" waste of money. He and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war. Speaking on bbc radio 4's thought for the day slot, he criticised the fact that ""billions"" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people ""out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease"". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to ""make history poverty""."
"British stars denied major oscars british hopes of winning major oscars were dashed as uk stars failed to win acting and directing prizes. Despite three nominations, mike leigh's vera drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star imelda staunton. Kate winslet also lost to best actress hilary swank, while clive owen and sophie okonedo failed to win best supporting actor awards. The uk's andrea arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama wasp. Arnold, who presented children's television shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s, said it was ""totally overwhelming"" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow uk nominees gary mckendry and ashvin kumar."
"Halloween writer debra hill dies screenwriter and producer debra hill, best known for her work on the 70s horror classic halloween, has died in los angeles aged 54. Hill, who had been suffering from cancer, co-wrote the 1978 film, which starred jamie lee curtis as a babysitter terrorised by a psychopath. Directed by john carpenter, it made over $60m (£31.3m) worldwide - a record for independent film at that time. Hill also worked with carpenter on escape from new york and the fog. Born in new jersey, hill began her career as a production assistant and worked her way through the ranks, becoming an assistant director and second-unit director before she began collaborating with carpenter. She was regarded by many as a pioneering woman in film, taking on jobs in the 70s that were more commonly taken by men."
"Broadband fuels online expression fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests. A quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by uk think-tank demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. The demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online."
"Yukos heading back to us courts russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival. The firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (£14bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted. Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law.

"Voters flock to blog awards site voting is under way for the annual bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year. Nominations were announced on sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors.

"Chinese dam firm 'defies beijing' the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the chinese state press has said. The builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam, said the beijing news. The xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant.

"Man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city. Wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. Seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. Steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar."
"Wales 'must learn health lessons' the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. Dr brian gibbons, on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked, admitted ""big challenges"" but insisted the ""essentials"" were in place. But both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile ms hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda. Dr gibbons, who was a gp in blaengwynfi, in the upper afan valley, before becoming am for aberavon, said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". One of the biggest problems which had faced ms hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in wales."

Optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. The company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading.

There had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen's role at the club. ""it is absolutely not true,"" arnesen told bbc radio five live.

Hugo southwell's try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o'gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, eddie o'sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight.

He was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. He said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so.

"Warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. However, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.

"More women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. The number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers."
"Podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. Podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free."

"Yukos seeks court action on sale yukos will return to a us court on wednesday to seek sanctions against baikal finance group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset. Yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear. Russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas, russia's fourth-biggest oil producer."

"Sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. Sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. ""why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california."
"Jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them ""where it hurts most"" by banning them from matches. Cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. She praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. Ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. Last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue."

"Home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. Research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the uk, germany, us and south korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. The nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes.

Mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. Mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. Tony blair has argued. There needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto.

The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. Hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty."

Here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical. Tuberculosis, hepatitis b and hiv. A positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis."

Bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is. Davies, one of the stars of saturday's rbs six nations win over england, is only on a year contract at kingsholm. But the hooker has proved his worth to the zurich premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season.

"New drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says. University college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 department of transport document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year."

"Deadline nears for fiat-gm deal fiat and general motors (gm) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover. The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat."

The uk's andrea arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama wasp. Arnold, who presented children's television shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s, said it was ""totally overwhelming"" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow uk nominees gary mckendry and ashvin kumar."

The firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (£14bn) tax bill.

Wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. Seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. Steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar."
"Wales 'must learn health lessons' the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. Dr brian gibbons, on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked, admitted ""big challenges"" but insisted the ""essentials"" were in place. But both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile ms hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda.

Download sales are due to be incorporated into the uk singles chart later this year. Digital sales in the us are already used to compile billboard's hot digital sales chart. They will now be tallied with sales of physical singles and airplay information to make up its new hot 100 chart. Its second new chart - the pop 100 - also combines airplay, digital and physical sales but confines its airplay information to us radio stations which play chart music."
"Anti-spam laws bite spammer hard the net's self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection. Scott richter, the man behind optinrealbig.com and billions of junk mail messages, said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11. Optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. The company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading. Listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus, optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws. The lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries."
"Arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane. There had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen's role at the club. ""it is absolutely not true,"" arnesen told bbc radio five live.

""he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself."" arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. He added: ""jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But i trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it."

Hugo southwell's try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell put the visitors in command by half-time.

Scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points."
"Economy focus for election battle britain's economic future will be at the heart of labour's poll campaign, chancellor gordon brown has said. He was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. He said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. Meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle ""yob culture"" and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. Earlier the archbishop of canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears. In an open letter, he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism, asylum, and crime."

Meanwhile, great britain could end 34 years of failure against australia with victory at elland road."
"Warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. However, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads ""urgent tsunami earthquake appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts."

"More women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. The number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers."
"Podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. Podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free."

Yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear. Russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas, russia's fourth-biggest oil producer."

"Sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. Sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. ""why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california."
"Jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them ""where it hurts most"" by banning them from matches. Cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. She praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. Ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. Last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue."

"Home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. Research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the uk, germany, us and south korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. The nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes.

Mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. Mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. Tony blair has argued. There needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto.

"Us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. The unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. Hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty."

Here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate.

Bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is. Davies, one of the stars of saturday's rbs six nations win over england, is only on a year contract at kingsholm.

"New drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says. University college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year.

"Deadline nears for fiat-gm deal fiat and general motors (gm) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover. The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort.

One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online."
"Yukos heading back to us courts russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival. The firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (£14bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted. Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means."
"Voters flock to blog awards site voting is under way for the annual bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year. Nominations were announced on sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors.

"Chinese dam firm 'defies beijing' the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the chinese state press has said. The builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam, said the beijing news. The xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant. So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china's state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order."
"Man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city. Wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. Seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. Steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar."
"Wales 'must learn health lessons' the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. Dr brian gibbons, on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked, admitted ""big challenges"" but insisted the ""essentials"" were in place. But both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile ms hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda. Dr gibbons, who was a gp in blaengwynfi, in the upper afan valley, before becoming am for aberavon, said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". One of the biggest problems which had faced ms hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in wales."

Billboard's hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart.

"Anti-spam laws bite spammer hard the net's self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection. Scott richter, the man behind optinrealbig.com and billions of junk mail messages, said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11. Optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. The company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading. Listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus, optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws. The lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries."

There had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen's role at the club. ""it is absolutely not true,"" arnesen told bbc radio five live.

He added: ""jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But i trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it."

Scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points."
"Economy focus for election battle britain's economic future will be at the heart of labour's poll campaign, chancellor gordon brown has said. He was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. He said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. Meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle ""yob culture"" and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. Earlier the archbishop of canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears. In an open letter, he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism, asylum, and crime."

Meanwhile, great britain could end 34 years of failure against australia with victory at elland road."
"Warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. However, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads ""urgent tsunami earthquake appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts."

"More women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. The number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004.

For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers."
"Podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. Podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free."

"Sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. Sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. ""why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california."

Cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. She praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. Ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive.

According to the study, more than 45 million people in the uk, germany, us and south korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. The nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes.

Mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. Mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. Tony blair has argued. There needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto.

"Us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. The unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. Hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.

Here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical. Tuberculosis, hepatitis b and hiv. A positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis."

Bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is. Davies, one of the stars of saturday's rbs six nations win over england, is only on a year contract at kingsholm.

Warriors' goalkeeper murambadoro, who made a name for himself at the african nations cup finals in tunisia, helped bnei sakhnin overcome albania's partizani tirana 6-1 in the previous round. Murambadoro moved to israel recently after a brief stint with south african club hellenic. The club won the israeli cup final last season and are based in sakhnin, which is near haifa. The club have a strong ethic and are high profile promoters of peace and co-operation within israel."
"New drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says. University college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 department of transport document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year."
"World leaders gather to face uncertainty more than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). For five days, they will discuss issues ranging from china's economic power to iraq's future after this sunday's elections. Uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the wef are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. The brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum, timed to run in parallel with the wef's ritzier event in davos."
"Deadline nears for fiat-gm deal fiat and general motors (gm) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover. The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat."
"Cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty, cardinal cormac murphy-o'connor has said. The head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass. The cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a ""terrible"" waste of money. He and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war. Speaking on bbc radio 4's thought for the day slot, he criticised the fact that ""billions"" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people ""out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease"". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to ""make history poverty""."
"British stars denied major oscars british hopes of winning major oscars were dashed as uk stars failed to win acting and directing prizes. Despite three nominations, mike leigh's vera drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star imelda staunton. Kate winslet also lost to best actress hilary swank, while clive owen and sophie okonedo failed to win best supporting actor awards. The uk's andrea arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama wasp. Arnold, who presented children's television shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s, said it was ""totally overwhelming"" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow uk nominees gary mckendry and ashvin kumar."
"Halloween writer debra hill dies screenwriter and producer debra hill, best known for her work on the 70s horror classic halloween, has died in los angeles aged 54. Hill, who had been suffering from cancer, co-wrote the 1978 film, which starred jamie lee curtis as a babysitter terrorised by a psychopath. Directed by john carpenter, it made over $60m (£31.3m) worldwide - a record for independent film at that time. Hill also worked with carpenter on escape from new york and the fog. Born in new jersey, hill began her career as a production assistant and worked her way through the ranks, becoming an assistant director and second-unit director before she began collaborating with carpenter. She was regarded by many as a pioneering woman in film, taking on jobs in the 70s that were more commonly taken by men."
"Broadband fuels online expression fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests. A quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by uk think-tank demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. The demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online."
"Yukos heading back to us courts russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival. The firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (£14bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted. Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means."
"Voters flock to blog awards site voting is under way for the annual bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year. Nominations were announced on sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors.

"Chinese dam firm 'defies beijing' the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the chinese state press has said. The builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam, said the beijing news. The xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant. So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china's state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order."
"Man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city. Wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. Seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. Steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar."
"Wales 'must learn health lessons' the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. Dr brian gibbons, on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked, admitted ""big challenges"" but insisted the ""essentials"" were in place. But both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile ms hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda. Dr gibbons, who was a gp in blaengwynfi, in the upper afan valley, before becoming am for aberavon, said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". One of the biggest problems which had faced ms hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in wales."

"Downloads enter us singles chart digital music downloads are being included in the main us singles chart for the first time. Billboard's hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart. Green day's boulevard of broken dreams is currently number two in billboard's pop chart, and tops its digital chart.

"Anti-spam laws bite spammer hard the net's self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection. Scott richter, the man behind optinrealbig.com and billions of junk mail messages, said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11. Optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. The company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading. Listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus, optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws. The lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries."

There had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen's role at the club. ""it is absolutely not true,"" arnesen told bbc radio five live. ""there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems. ""he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself."" arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. He added: ""jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But i trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it."

Hugo southwell's try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o'gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, eddie o'sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points."
"Economy focus for election battle britain's economic future will be at the heart of labour's poll campaign, chancellor gordon brown has said. He was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. He said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. Meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle ""yob culture"" and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. Earlier the archbishop of canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears. In an open letter, he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism, asylum, and crime."

And at 1815 gmt, great britain's rugby league team take on australia in the final of the tri-nations tournament.

England have the chance to seal their third autumn international victory after successive wins over canada and south africa, as well as gaining revenge for june's 51-15 hammering by the wallabies. Meanwhile, great britain could end 34 years of failure against australia with victory at elland road."
"Warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. However, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads ""urgent tsunami earthquake appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts."

Bids have been invited from local, arab and foreign companies, iraq's ministry of communications said. The winner will work in partnership with the iraqi telecommunications and post company (itpc).

"More women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. The number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers."
"Podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. Podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free."

Yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear. Russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, £4.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas, russia's fourth-biggest oil producer."

Lee miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over colin meldrum and into the net from a jamie mcallister free kick. Mcallister himself scored the second when he met saul mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. Craig easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but hearts held on. The opening goal came after gus bahoken had clumsily fouled miller 35 yards from goal.

"Sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. Sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. ""why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california."
"Jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them ""where it hurts most"" by banning them from matches.

She praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. Ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive.

"Home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. Research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the uk, germany, us and south korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. The nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends. In the uk 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile."

Mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. Mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. Tony blair has argued. There needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto.

"Us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. The unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. Hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. But the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty."

"Wal-mart fights back at accusers two big us names have launched advertising campaigns to ""set the record straight"" about their products and corporate behaviour. The world's biggest retailer wal-mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers. The group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals, benefits package and promotion strategy. Meanwhile, drugs group eli lilly is planning a campaign against ""false"" claims about its product prozac. Wal-mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the wall street journal, using an open letter from company president lee scott saying it was time for the public to hear the ""unfiltered truth"". ""there are lots of 'urban legends' going around these days about wal-mart, but facts are facts."
"Tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the conservatives. Party leader michael howard said the new role would replace ""inconspicuous"" police authorities. He said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. The lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while labour criticised ""extravagant"" tory promises on policing. Responding to the plans, the chairman of the police federation of england and wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained. Jan berry said: ""it is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. ""these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,"" she warned."
"At a glance: tory health checks the uk' opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. Here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical. Tuberculosis, hepatitis b and hiv. A positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis."
"Paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday's epic in paris? and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978? those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris. Welsh legend mervyn davies, a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as ""one of the great performances of the past three decades"". Martyn williams, wales' two-try scorer on the day, called it ""one of the most surreal games i have ever played in"". A crestfallen france coach, bernard laporte, simply observed: ""there was a french half and there was a welsh half""."
"Doves soar to uk album summit manchester rock band doves have entered the uk album chart at number one with their new release, some cities. The trio replace flamboyant us act scissor sisters at the top. The album follows single black and white town, which reached number six. R&b star nelly has the new number one single with over and over, which sees him team up with tim mcgraw. Girls aloud, akon and kaiser chiefs all have new singles in the top ten, as do futureheads and usher.

Hip-hop performer akon's locked up is at number five, while hotly-tipped leeds band kaiser chiefs have their second chart hit at number six with oh my god."
"Davies favours gloucester future wales hooker mefin davies is likely to stay with english side gloucester despite reported interest from the neath-swansea ospreys. Bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is. Davies, one of the stars of saturday's rbs six nations win over england, is only on a year contract at kingsholm. But the hooker has proved his worth to the zurich premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. The summer demise of the celtic warriors region left davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with neath rfc. Although he got match time with the ospreys at the request of the wales management, he admitted before his move to gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated."
"Cabinet anger at brown cash raid ministers are unhappy about plans to use whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down, local government minister nick raynsford has acknowledged. Gordon brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-budget report on thursday. Mr raynsford said he had held some ""pretty frank discussions"" with fellow ministers over the plans. But he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises. The central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in england keep next year's council tax rises below 5%, in what is likely to be a general election year. Mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities."
"Israeli club look to africa four african players, including zimbabwe goalkeeper energy murambadoro, are all ready to play for israeli club hapoel bnei sakhnin in the uefa cup. Bnei sakhnin are the first arab side ever to play in european competition and will play english premiership side newcastle united in the first round.

The club have a strong ethic and are high profile promoters of peace and co-operation within israel."
"New drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says. University college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 department of transport document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year."
"World leaders gather to face uncertainty more than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). For five days, they will discuss issues ranging from china's economic power to iraq's future after this sunday's elections. Uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the wef are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. The brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum, timed to run in parallel with the wef's ritzier event in davos."
"Deadline nears for fiat-gm deal fiat and general motors (gm) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover. The deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. Gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat."
"Cardinal criticises iraq war cost billions of pounds spent on conflict in iraq and in the middle east should have been used to reduce poverty, cardinal cormac murphy-o'connor has said. The head of the catholic church in england and wales made the comments on bbc radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his christmas midnight mass. The cardinal used a christmas message to denounce the war in iraq as a ""terrible"" waste of money. He and the archbishop of canterbury have both spoken out about the war. Speaking on bbc radio 4's thought for the day slot, he criticised the fact that ""billions"" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people ""out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease"". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to ""make history poverty""."
"British stars denied major oscars british hopes of winning major oscars were dashed as uk stars failed to win acting and directing prizes. Despite three nominations, mike leigh's vera drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star imelda staunton. Kate winslet also lost to best actress hilary swank, while clive owen and sophie okonedo failed to win best supporting actor awards. The uk's andrea arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama wasp. Arnold, who presented children's television shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s, said it was ""totally overwhelming"" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow uk nominees gary mckendry and ashvin kumar."
"Halloween writer debra hill dies screenwriter and producer debra hill, best known for her work on the 70s horror classic halloween, has died in los angeles aged 54. Hill, who had been suffering from cancer, co-wrote the 1978 film, which starred jamie lee curtis as a babysitter terrorised by a psychopath. Directed by john carpenter, it made over $60m (£31.3m) worldwide - a record for independent film at that time. Hill also worked with carpenter on escape from new york and the fog. Born in new jersey, hill began her career as a production assistant and worked her way through the ranks, becoming an assistant director and second-unit director before she began collaborating with carpenter. She was regarded by many as a pioneering woman in film, taking on jobs in the 70s that were more commonly taken by men."
"Broadband fuels online expression fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests. A quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by uk think-tank demos. It said that having an always-on, fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. More than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast. The demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits. It found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. One in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web. More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online."
"Yukos heading back to us courts russian oil and gas company yukos is due in a us court on thursday as it continues to fight for its survival. The firm is in the process of being broken up by russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (£14bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the us, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted. Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated us bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means."
"Voters flock to blog awards site voting is under way for the annual bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year. Nominations were announced on sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors. Weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories, from the top regional blog, to the best-kept-secret blog. Blogs had a huge year, with a top us dictionary naming ""blog"" word of 2004. Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily.

"Chinese dam firm 'defies beijing' the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the chinese state press has said. The builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam, said the beijing news. The xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant. So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china's state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order."
"Man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city. Wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. Seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. Steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar."
"Wales 'must learn health lessons' the new health minister for wales says there are lessons to learn from england in tackling waiting lists. Dr brian gibbons, on his first full day in the job after jane hutt was sacked, admitted ""big challenges"" but insisted the ""essentials"" were in place. But both plaid cymru and the liberal democrats said dr gibbons needed to change policy. Meanwhile ms hutt defended her record, saying waiting times and lists were ""only 10% of the health agenda. Dr gibbons, who was a gp in blaengwynfi, in the upper afan valley, before becoming am for aberavon, said nhs staff wanted a period of consolidation after ""tremendous change and reform"". One of the biggest problems which had faced ms hutt during her five-and-a-half years as the assembly's first health minister was the length of waiting lists in wales."

"Downloads enter us singles chart digital music downloads are being included in the main us singles chart for the first time. Billboard's hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart. Green day's boulevard of broken dreams is currently number two in billboard's pop chart, and tops its digital chart. Download sales are due to be incorporated into the uk singles chart later this year. Digital sales in the us are already used to compile billboard's hot digital sales chart. They will now be tallied with sales of physical singles and airplay information to make up its new hot 100 chart.

"Anti-spam laws bite spammer hard the net's self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection. Scott richter, the man behind optinrealbig.com and billions of junk mail messages, said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11. Optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. The company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading. Listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus, optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws. The lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries."

There had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen's role at the club. ""it is absolutely not true,"" arnesen told bbc radio five live. ""there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems. ""he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself."" arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. He added: ""jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But i trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it."

Hugo southwell's try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o'gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, eddie o'sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points."
"Economy focus for election battle britain's economic future will be at the heart of labour's poll campaign, chancellor gordon brown has said. He was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. He said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. Meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle ""yob culture"" and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. Earlier the archbishop of canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears. In an open letter, he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism, asylum, and crime."
Brizzel to run aaa's in sheffield ballymena sprinter paul brizzel will be among eight of ireland's european indoor hopefuls competing in this weekend's aaa's championships.

Corkman mark carroll confirmed in midweek that he would join cragg in the european championships. Carroll is ranked number three in the world 3000m ranking at the moment with cragg occupying top spot.

England have the chance to seal their third autumn international victory after successive wins over canada and south africa, as well as gaining revenge for june's 51-15 hammering by the wallabies. Meanwhile, great britain could end 34 years of failure against australia with victory at elland road."
"Warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims. The site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. However, dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. The site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster. The link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. The message's subject line reads ""urgent tsunami earthquake appeal"" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts."

"More women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. The number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers."
"Podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill. But more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called ""podcasting"" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. Podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free."

Yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. Yukos' us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale.

Lee miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over colin meldrum and into the net from a jamie mcallister free kick. Mcallister himself scored the second when he met saul mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. Craig easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but hearts held on. The opening goal came after gus bahoken had clumsily fouled miller 35 yards from goal.

"Sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour. Sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity. The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. ""why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california."
"Jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them ""where it hurts most"" by banning them from matches. Cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. She praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. Ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. Last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue."

"Home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. Research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the uk, germany, us and south korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. The nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends. In the uk 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile."

Mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. The cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. Mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. The group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. The government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. Tony blair has argued. There needs to be consensus on reforms. There have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto.

"Us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date.

Here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical. Tuberculosis, hepatitis b and hiv.

"New drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says. University college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government's road safety bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country £119m a year. A previous estimate, contained in a 1998 department of transport document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year."
